 
  The saga that began with the interstellar best seller
  
   William Shakespeare's Star Wars
  
  continues with this merry reimagining of George Lucas's enduring classic
  
   The Empire Strikes Back.
  
 
 
  Many a fortnight have passed since the destruction of the Death Star. Young Luke Skywalker and his friends have taken refuge on the ice planet of Hoth, where the evil Darth Vader has hatched a cold-blooded plan to capture them. Only with the help of a little green Jedi Masterand a swaggering rascal named Lando Calrissiancan our heroes escape the Empire's wrath. And only then will Lord Vader learn how sharper than a tauntaun's tooth it is to have a Jedi child.
 
 
  What light through Yoda's window breaks? Methinks you'll find out in the pages of
  
   The Empire Striketh Back!
