   Forever
  
  
   Fifty
  
  and
  
   Suddenly
  
  
   Sixty
  
  tackles the ins and outs of becoming a septuagenarian with wry good humor. Fans of Viorsts funny, touching, and wise decades poems will love these verses filled with witty advice and reflections on marriage, milestones, and middle-aged children.
 
 
  Viorst explores, among the many other issues of this stage of life, the state of our sex lives and teeth, how we can stay married though thermostatically incompatible, and the joys of grandparenthood and shopping. Readers will nod with rueful recognition when she asks, Am I required to think of myself as a basically shallow woman because I feel better when my hair looks good?, when she presses a few helpful suggestions on her kids because they may be middle aged, but theyre still my children, and when she graciouslybut not too graciouslyselects her husbands next mate in a poem deliciously subtitled If I Should Die Before I Wake, Heres the Wife You Next Should Take. Though Viorst acknowledges she is definitely not a good sport about the fact that she is mortal, her poems are full of the pleasures of life right now, helping us come to terms with the passage of time, encouraging us to keep trying to fix the world, and inviting us to consider drinking wine, making love, laughing hard, caring hard, and learning a new trick or two as part of our job description at seventy.
