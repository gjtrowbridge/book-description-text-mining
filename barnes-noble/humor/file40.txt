   New York Times
  
  Best Seller!
 
 
  
   
    By the actress, writer, and one of the funniest women on Twitter, an outrageous, hysterical memoir of acting on impulse, plotting elaborate hoaxes, and refusing to acknowledge boundaries in any form
   
  
 
 
  Jenny Mollen is an actress and writer living in Los Angeles. She is also a wife, married to a famous guy (which is annoying only because he gets free shit and she doesn't). She doesnt want much from life. Just to be lovedby everybody: her parents, her dogs, her ex-boyfriends, her ex-boyfriends dogs, her husband, her husbands ex-girlfriends, her husband's ex-girlfriend's new boyfriends, etc. Some people might call that impulse crazy, but isnt "crazy" really just a word boring people use to describe fun people? (And Jenny is really, really fun, you guys!)
 
 
  In these pages, youll find stories of Jenny at her most genuine, whether its stalking her therapist (because he knows everything about her so shouldnt she get to know everything about him?); throwing a bachelorette party so bad that one of the guests is suspected dead; or answering the eternal question,
  
   Would your best friend blow your husband on a car ride to dinner if she didn't know you were hiding in the backseat?
  
 
 
  
   I Like You Just the Way I Am
  
  is about
  
   not
  
  doing the right thingabout indulging your inner crazy-person. It is Jenny when shes not trying to impress anyone or come across as a responsible, level-headed member of society. With any luck it will make
  
   you
  
  better acquainted with who
  
   you
  
  really are and what
  
   you
  
  really want. Which, lets be honest, is most likely someone elses email password.
