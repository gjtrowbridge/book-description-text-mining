 
  
   Behind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.
  
  
  
  From politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room,the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our governmentand each day they pass judgment on those who dont worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.
 
 
  From what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.
 
 
  How do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:
  
  - If you don't agree with them no one will like you.
  
  - If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.
  
  - If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser
 
 
  How do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.
