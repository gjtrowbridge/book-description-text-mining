This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement.

Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life\u2014like Harry\u2019s, like America\u2019s in 1963\u2014turning on a dime. Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958.
