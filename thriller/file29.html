  Detective Stephen Moran has been waiting for his chance to get a foot in the door of Dublins Murder Squadand one morning, sixteen-year-old Holly Mackey brings him this photo. The Secret Place, a board where the girls at St. Kildas School can pin up their secrets anonymously, is normally a mishmash of gossip and covert cruelty, but today someone has used it to reignite the stalled investigation into the murder of handsome, popular Chris Harper. Stephen joins forces with the abrasive Detective Antoinette Conway to find out who and why.

  But everything they discover leads them back to Hollys close-knit group of friends and their fierce enemies, a rival cliqueand to the tangled web of relationships that bound all the girls to Chris Harper. Every step in their direction turns up the pressure. Antoinette Conway is already suspicious of Stephens links to the Mackey family. St. Kildas will go a long way to keep murder outside their walls. Hollys father, Detective Frank Mackey, is circling, ready to pounce if any of the new evidence points toward his daughter. And the private underworld of teenage girls can be more mysterious and more dangerous than either of the detectives imagined.
