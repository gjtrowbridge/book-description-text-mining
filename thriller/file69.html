   It takes more than a lurid legend
  </b>
  <b>
   to scare off the League of Literary Ladies
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Halloween, the Literary Ladies have chosen to read Washington Irvings spooky classic,
  <i>
   The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
  </i>
  , with its infamous headless horseman. But South Bass Island has its own headless legendof a Prohibition bootlegger named Charlie Sleepy Harlow. Decapitated by rival rumrunners, Harlow appears once a year in spectral form to search for his noggin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This October, the Elkhart Ghost Getters (EGG) have returned to the island. The group claims that they have film footage of Harlows ghost, and are determined to get more. Theyre staying at Bea Cartwrights B and B, but its Kate Wilder who isnt happy to see them after they trashed her winery last year. When the EGG leader turns up dead, Kate becomes the prime suspect, and the other League members need to scramble to crack the case.
