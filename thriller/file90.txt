 
  Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldiers son. An elite military cop, he was one of the armys brightest stars. But in every cops life there is one case that changes everything. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.
  
  
   
  
  New Years Day, 1990. In a North Carolina motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. Within hours the generals wife is murdered. Then the dominoes really start to fall.
 
 
  Somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Reacher is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher wont quit. Hes fighting a new kind of waragainst an enemy he didnt know he had. And against a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.
