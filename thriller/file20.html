   You can leave the army, but the army doesnt leave you. Not always. Not completely,
  </i>
  notes Jack Reacherand sure enough, the retired military cop is soon pulled back into service. This time, for the State Department and the CIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Someone has taken a shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was American. The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence? Very few, but John Kottan American marksman gone badis one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, hes out, unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with enough world leaders to tempt any assassin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If anyone can stop Kott, its the man who beat him before: Reacher. And though hed rather work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who keeps her cool with Zoloft. But theyre facing a rough road, full of ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crossesand no backup if theyre caught. All the while Reacher cant stop thinking about the woman he once failed to save. But he wont let that that happen again. Not this time. Not Nice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reacher never gets too close. But now a killer is making it personal.

  Reacher is the stuff of myth, a great male fantasy. . . . One of this centurys most original, tantalizing pop-fiction heroes . . . Child does a masterly job of bringing his adventure to life with endless surprises and fierce suspense.
