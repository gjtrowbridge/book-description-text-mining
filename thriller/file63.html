It appears shes been murdered, mere weeks before the trial in her $100 million lawsuit against her former financial manager, and Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta doubts its a coincidence.

  , Scarpetta and her colleagues are up against a force far more sinister than a sexual predator who fits the criminal classification of a spectacle killer. The murder of Gail Shipton soon leads deep into the dark world of designer drugs, drone technology, organized crime, and shocking corruption at the highest levels.
