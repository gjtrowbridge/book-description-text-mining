  Jenny Mollen is an actress and writer living in Los Angeles. She is also a wife, married to a famous guy (which is annoying only because he gets free shit and she doesn't). She doesnt want much from life. Just to be lovedby everybody: her parents, her dogs, her ex-boyfriends, her ex-boyfriends dogs, her husband, her husbands ex-girlfriends, her husband's ex-girlfriend's new boyfriends, etc. Some people might call that impulse crazy, but isnt "crazy" really just a word boring people use to describe fun people? (And Jenny is really, really fun, you guys!)

  In these pages, youll find stories of Jenny at her most genuine, whether its stalking her therapist (because he knows everything about her so shouldnt she get to know everything about him?); throwing a bachelorette party so bad that one of the guests is suspected dead; or answering the eternal question,

  is about
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  doing the right thingabout indulging your inner crazy-person. It is Jenny when shes not trying to impress anyone or come across as a responsible, level-headed member of society. With any luck it will make

   you

  better acquainted with who
  <i>
   you
  </i>
  really are and what
  <i>
   you

  really want. Which, lets be honest, is most likely someone elses email password.
