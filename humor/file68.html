   A hilarious pictorial parody of a clueless father and his adorable daughter
  </b>

  In an attempt to create an image that his new daughter would one day appreciate, Dave Engledow took a photo in which hes cradling eight-week-old Alice Bee like a football and doctored it to look like hes squirting breast milk into a "Worlds Best Father" mug. Friends and family clamored for more. After Daves humorous attempts to capture the sleep-deprived obliviousness of being a first-time dad went viral, he and Alice Bee found themselves bona fide Internet and television celebrities.

  Merging a Norman Rockwell aesthetic with a darkly comic sensibility, Dave pairs each side-splittingly funny image with a log entry describing the awkward situation that the Worlds Best Father has found himself in.
