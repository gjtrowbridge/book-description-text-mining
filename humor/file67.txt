 
 
 Perhaps the most brilliant comic strip ever created,
 
  Calvin and Hobbes
 
 continues to entertain with dazzling cartooning and tremendous humor.
 
 Bill Watterson's
 
  Calvin and Hobbes
 
 has been a worldwide favorite since its introduction in 1985. The strip follows the richly imaginative adventures of Calvin and his trusty tiger, Hobbes. Whether a poignant look at serious family issues or a round of time-travel (with the aid of a well-labeled cardboard box),
 
  Calvin and Hobbes
 
 will astound and delight you.
 
 
 Beginning with the day Hobbes sprang into Calvin's tuna fish trap, the first two
 
  Calvin and Hobbes
 
 collections,
 
  Calvin and Hobbes
 
 and
 
  Something Under The Bed Is Drooling
 
 , are brought together in this treasury. Including black-and-white dailies and color Sundays,
 
  The Essential Calvin and Hobbes
 
 also features an original full-color 16-page story.
 
 
  Here is the all-inclusive chronicle of events beginning with the day Hobbes sprang into Calvin's tuna-fish trap and their friendship was forged forever. Essential not only for its thoroughness, including full-color Sunday cartoons, but also for the never-before-published cartoon story it features.
