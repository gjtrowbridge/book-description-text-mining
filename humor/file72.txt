   Meet Me At Emotional Baggage Claim
  
  , readers can count on an ab-toning laugh session, a silly giggle, a sympathetic sigh, and a lump in the throat as lifes moments are rehashed through the keen eyes and wits of this lovable mother-daughter duo. This fourth volume,

Ok, to be honest, Lisa is acquiring the puppies, while Francesca is lucky enough to have dates with actual men. They leave it to the listeners to decide which is more desirable and/or or easier to train.
