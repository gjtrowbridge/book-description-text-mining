  As you read this book, there are a few things you have to understand: 95 percent of my stories are truthful. Every member of the Robertson family has the God- given gift of storytelling. Hey, when youve sat in a duck blind for more than half of your life, you have to figure out some way to pass the time! Its better than looking at Willie and Jase for six hours! Many of the stories I like to tell happened when I was a young boy or when I was in Vietnam. At my age, a few of the details are cloudy, but Ill recollect the coming stories as best I can. Hey, just remember it isnt a lie if you think its true! Its up to you, the reader, to figure out whats truth and whats fiction. Best of luck with that, Jack! May the force be with you.

  Hey, another thing you have to know: my stories are kind of like my vocabulary. You might have noticed I like to say hey quite a bit. Hey can mean anything. It can mean yes, it can mean maybe, and it can mean no. Hey, it could mean next week. The bottom line is, you have to understand hey to understand me.

  And if you know anything about Silas Merritt Robertson, you know Im a hard rascal to figure out.
