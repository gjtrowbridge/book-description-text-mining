 bestselling
 
  Ill Mature When Im Dead
 
 , Dave Barry embarked on the treacherous seas of adulthood, to hilarious results. What comes next? Parenthood, of course, and families.
 
  In uproarious, brand-new pieces, Barry tackles everything from family trips, bat mitzvah parties and dating (hes serious about that title: When my daughter can legally commence datingFebruary 24, 2040I intend to monitor her closely, even if I am deceased) to funeral instructions (I would like my eulogy to be given by William Shatner), the differences between male and female friendships, the deeper meaning of
  
   Fifty Shades of Grey
  
  , and a fathers ultimate sacrifice: accompanying his daughter to a Justin Bieber concert (It turns out that the noise teenaged girls make to express happiness is the same noise they would make if their feet were being gnawed off by badgers).
 
 
  Lets face it: families not only enrich our lives every day, they drive us completely around the bend. Thank goodness we have Dave Barry as our guide!
