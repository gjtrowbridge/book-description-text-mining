  Everyones life is governed by an internal code of conduct. Some call it morality. Others call it religion. But Bros in the know call this Holy Grail
  
   The Bro Code.
  
 
 
  
   The Bro Code
  
  is a living document, much like the Constitution. Except instead of outlining a government, or the Bill of Rights, or anything even resembling laws,
  
   The Bro Code
  
  provides men with all the rules they need to know in order to become a bro and behave properly among other bros. Historically a spoken tradition passed from one generation to the next and dating back to the American Revolution, the official code of conduct for Bros appears here in its published form for the first time ever. By upholding the tenets of this sacred and legendary document, any dude can learn to achieve Bro-dom.
 
 
  Containing approximately 150 unspoken rules, this code of conduct for bros can range from the simple (bros before hos) to the complex (the hot-to-crazy ratio, complete with bar graphs and charts). With helpful sidebros
  
   The Bro Code
  
  will help any ordinary guy become the best bro he can be. Let ultimate bro and co-author Barney Stinson and his book,
  
   The Bro Code
  
  share their wisdom, lest you be caught making eye contact in a devils three-way (two dudes, duh).
