  In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chasts memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
 
 
  When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the crazy closetwith predictable resultsthe tools that had served Roz well through her parents seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
 
 
  While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasiesan anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decadesthe themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
 
 
  An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can,
  
   Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant
  
  will show the full range of Roz Chasts talent as cartoonist and storyteller.
