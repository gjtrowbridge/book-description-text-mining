  Dunham illuminates the experiences that are part of making ones way in the world: falling in love, feeling alone, being ten pounds overweight despite eating only health food, having to prove yourself in a room full of men twice your age, finding true love, and most of all, having the guts to believe that your story is one that deserves to be told.

  <br/>
  Take My Virginity (No Really, Take It) is the account of Dunhams first time, and how her expectations of sex didnt quite live up to the actual event (No floodgate had been opened, no vault of true womanhood unlocked); Girls &amp; Jerks explores her former attraction to less-than-nice guysguys who had perfected the dynamic of disrespect she found so intriguing; Is This Even Real? is a meditation on her lifelong obsession with death and dyingwhat she calls her genetically predestined morbidity. And in I Didnt F*** Them, but They Yelled at Me, she imagines the tell-all she will write when she is eighty and past caring, able to reflect honestly on the sexism and condescension she has encountered in Hollywood, where women are treated like the paper thingies that protect glasses in hotel bathroomsnecessary but infinitely disposable.

  Exuberant, moving, and keenly observed,

  is a series of dispatches from the frontlines of the struggle that is growing up. Im already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you, Dunham writes. But if I can take what Ive learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine will have been worthwhile.

  The gifted Ms. Dunham not only writes with observant precision, but also brings a measure of perspective, nostalgia and an older persons sort of wisdom to her portrait of her (not all that much) younger self and her world. . . . By simply telling her own story in all its specificity and sometimes embarrassing detail, she has written a book thats as acute and heartfelt as it is funny.

  Dunham has crafted warm, intelligent writing that is both deeply personal and engaging. . . . [Hers] is not only a voice who deserves to be heard but also one who will inspire other important voices to tell their stories too.

  A lovely, touching, surprisingly sentimental portrait of a woman who, despite repeatedly baring her body and soul to audiences, remains a bit of an enigma: a young woman who sets the agenda, defies classification and seems utterly at home in her own skin.

  A lot of us fear we dont measure up beautywise and that we endure too much crummy treatment from men. On these topics, Dunham is funny, wise, and, yes, brave. . . . Among Dunhams gifts to womankind is her frontline example that some asshole may call you undesirable or worse, and it wont kill you. Your version matters more.
