 
  FROM THE PUBLISHER:
  
  Every time Allie Brosh posts something new on her hugely popular blog Hyperbole and a Half the internet rejoices.
 
 
  Touching, absurd, and darkly comic, Allie Broshs highly anticipated book
  
   Hyperbole and a Half
  
  showcases her unique voice, leaping wit, and her ability to capture complex emotions with deceptively simple illustrations.
 
 
  This full-color, beautifully illustrated edition features more than fifty percent new content, with ten never-before-seen essays and one wholly revised and expanded piece as well as classics from the website like, The God of Cake, Dogs Dont Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving, and her astonishing, Adventures in Depression, and Depression Part Two, which have been hailed as some of the most insightful meditations on the disease ever written.
 
 
  Broshs debut marks the launch of a major new American humorist who will surely make even the biggest scrooge or snob laugh. We dare you not to.
 
 
  FROM THE AUTHOR:
  
  This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritativelike maybe someone who isnt me wrote itbut I soon discovered that Im not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:
 
 
  Pictures
  
  Words
  
  Stories about things that happened to me
  
  Stories about things that happened to other people because of me
  
  Eight billion dollars*
  
  Stories about dogs
  
  The secret to eternal happiness*
 
 
  *These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!
