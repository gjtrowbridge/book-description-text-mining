   Go the F*** to Sleep
  
  is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don't always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. Profane, affectionate, and radically honest, California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach's verses perfectly capture the familiarand unspokentribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, they open up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations, and laugh at their absurdity.
 
 
  With illustrations by Ricardo Cortes,
  
   Go the F*** to Sleep
  
  is beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funnya book for parents new, old, and expectant. You probably should not read it to your children.

   Go the F*** to Sleep
  
  and appropriate for kids of all ages, is forthcoming from Akashic Books in April 2012 and available NOW for pre-order.
