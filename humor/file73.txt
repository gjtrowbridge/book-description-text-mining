  What do you do after you write a #1 bestselling book about your drunken, sexual misadventures that makes you rich and famous? Celebrate by getting more drunk and having insane amounts of sex, obviously. And pretty soon youve got another bestselling book on your hands.
 
 
  Stuffed full of ridiculous stories of bad decisions, debauchery, and sexual recklessness,

  starts where
  
   I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell
  
  left off, then proceeds to some next-level shit.
 
 
  You already know how women react to confidence, game, and vodka, but what happens when you add money and fame to the mix? You get answers to the hard questions you've never thought of asking:
 
 
   Whats it like to have sex with a midget? What about two midgets?
  
   What does it do to a man to watch a nineteen-year-old do wind sprints to sober up, so that she can have sex with you before her twin sister does?
  
   At what number of virgins does deflowering them stop being fun and start feeling like a job?
  
   When a girl you met three hours ago decides to tattoo your name on her body, what is the appropriate reaction?
 
 
  The answers are inside, they are absurd and hilarious, and they are the product of one man's experiences:
 
 
  His name is Tucker Max, and he is still an asshole.
