  For Diane Keaton, being beautiful starts with being true to who you are, and in this book she also offers self-knowing commentary on the bold personal choices shes made through the years: the wide-brimmed hats, outrageous shoes, and all-weather turtlenecks that have made her an inspiration to anyone who cherishes truly individual styleand catnip to paparazzi worldwide. She recounts her experiences with the many men in her lifeincluding Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, and Sam Shepardshows how our ideals of beauty change as we age, and explains why a life well lived may be the most beautiful thing of all.

  Relaxing and charming . . . like a dishy lunch with the movie star you thought youd never be lucky enough to meet. . . . This is delicious writing and is full of a positive point of view, exclamations of the beauty of ordinary things and helped turn me from sour to sweet in the few hours that I was reading her book. . . . Diane Keaton is in a class by herself and this book is good for the soul.

  Shes talented, iconic, quirky . . . and wonderfully blunt. This is just a small sampling of the reasons we love Diane Keaton, and they all permeate the pages of her new memoir. . . . Keaton sticks to her guns and keeps it totally honest. And it is

  refreshing.
