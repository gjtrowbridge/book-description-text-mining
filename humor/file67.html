 Perhaps the most brilliant comic strip ever created,
 <i>
  Calvin and Hobbes
 </i>
 continues to entertain with dazzling cartooning and tremendous humor.
 <br/>
 Bill Watterson's
 <i>
  Calvin and Hobbes
 </i>
 has been a worldwide favorite since its introduction in 1985. The strip follows the richly imaginative adventures of Calvin and his trusty tiger, Hobbes. Whether a poignant look at serious family issues or a round of time-travel (with the aid of a well-labeled cardboard box),
 <i>
  Calvin and Hobbes
 </i>
 will astound and delight you.

 <br/>
 Beginning with the day Hobbes sprang into Calvin's tuna fish trap, the first two

 collections,
 <i>
  Calvin and Hobbes
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Something Under The Bed Is Drooling
 </i>
 , are brought together in this treasury. Including black-and-white dailies and color Sundays,
 <i>
  The Essential Calvin and Hobbes
 </i>
 also features an original full-color 16-page story.

  Here is the all-inclusive chronicle of events beginning with the day Hobbes sprang into Calvin's tuna-fish trap and their friendship was forged forever. Essential not only for its thoroughness, including full-color Sunday cartoons, but also for the never-before-published cartoon story it features.
