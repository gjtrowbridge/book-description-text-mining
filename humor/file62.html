  LOOK, MAYBE YOURE A NICE GIRL, but were guessing youre more like us or you probably wouldnt have picked up this book. Not that we have a problem with girls who are nice people. But being nice is just not the way to get what you want. And this book is about getting what you want. Not in like a finding happiness, giving back to the world, being grateful for what you have sort of way. But in a ruling your world, being the most desired, powerful badass in the room way, so you can come out on top of any situation: guys, career, friends, enemies, whatever.

  We didnt come up with these life lessons. Were just the ones who wrote it all down. This is not self-help. Self-help is for fat people and divorces. This is how to deal with your problems when you have no problems. Youre welcome.
