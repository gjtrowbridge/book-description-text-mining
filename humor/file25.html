  Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.

 <p>
  She has seen both these dreams come true.

  At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on
  <em>
   Saturday Night Live
  </em>
  ; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.

  Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.
