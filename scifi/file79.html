 best-selling saga continues as dark elf Drizzt DoUrden returns to Gauntlgrym with old friends by his side once again, as they seek to rescue Bruenors loyal shield dwarf-turned-vampire. But not only do Drizzt and his allies face a perilous journey through the Underdark and the dangers of the undead that lie within, but they must cross through a colony of drow, who would like nothing better than to see Drizzt DoUrden dead.
