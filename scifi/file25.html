 As in all Abercrombies books, friends turn out to be enemies, enemies turn out to be friends; the line between good and evil is murky indeed; and nothing goes quite as we expect. With eye-popping plot twists and rollicking good action,
 <i>
  Half a King
 </i>
 is definitely a full adventure.

 Polished and sharp, perhaps his most technically proficient novel yet . . . I dare you to read the first chapter and try not to turn the next page.

 <i>
  Half a King
 </i>
 can be summed up in a single word: masterpiece. Its a coming-of-age story. Its a Viking saga. Its a revenge tale and family drama and the return of the prodigal son. But most of all, its this: a short time alongside people as weak and blundering as we are and, in the midst of it all, as heroic. Far too short a time, as it turns out. What a wonderful book.

 is full of all the adventure Ive come to expect from Abercrombie and a tenderness I never knew he had.
