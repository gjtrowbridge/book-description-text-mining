 In 1978, Stephen King published
 
  The Stand
 
 , the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published,
 
  The Stand
 
 was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.
 
  Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety.
  
   The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition
  
  includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.
 
 
  For hundreds of thousands of fans who read
  
   The Stand
  
  in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading
  
   The Stand
  
  for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.
