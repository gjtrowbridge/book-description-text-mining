   Richard saw the point of a sword blade sticking out from between the mans shoulder blades. He spun back toward Richard after throwing the woman out the opening, ready to attack. It seemed impossible, but the man looked unaffected by the blade that had impaled him through the chest.

   Three knives were buried up to their brass cross-guards in the mans chest. Only the handles were showing. Richard saw, too, the broken end of a sword blade jutting out from the center of the mans chest. The point of that same blade stuck out from the mans back.
