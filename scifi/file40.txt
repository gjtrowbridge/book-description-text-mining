  The mayor of Chicago has announced a plan to round up the citys supernatural beings and put them in camps. With her due date looming, Maddys best move would be to lay low for a while. But not everyone is willing to respect her privacy. Hounded by tentacled monsters, a rogue shapeshifter, and a tenacious blogger, Maddy turns to her most powerful ally, her uncle Daharan, only to find him missing.
 
 
  Just when it seems like things cant get any worse, Maddy gets an invitation in the mailto Lucifers wedding. Turns out everyone has been invited, friends and enemies alike. And with that kind of guest list, its highly unlikely there will be a happily ever after.
