 After a cyclone scoops them up with their Kansas farmhouse, Dorothy and her dog Toto find themselves transported to Oz, a magical land that is home to diminutive munchkins, witches wicked and good, flying monkeys, and all manner of marvelous creatures and beings. In the company of friends whom she makes during her stay--a Tin Woodman in search of a heart, a Scarecrow desperate for a brain, and a Cowardly Lion who craves courage--Dorothy seeks out the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the only person in the land with the power to return her to her rightful home.
