 In 1978, Stephen King published
 <i>
  The Stand
 </i>
 , the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published,
 <i>
  The Stand
 </i>
 was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.
 <p>
  Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety.
  <b>
   The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition
  </b>
  includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.
 </p>
 <p>
  For hundreds of thousands of fans who read
  <i>
   The Stand
  </i>
  in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading
  <i>
   The Stand
  </i>
  for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.
