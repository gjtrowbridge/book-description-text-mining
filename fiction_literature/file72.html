  On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to completing her quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once, she was the Justice of Toren - a colossal starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers in the service of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.
