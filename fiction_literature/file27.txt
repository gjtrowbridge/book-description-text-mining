  After five hectic years of retirement from Lords Chapel, Father Tim Kavanagh returns with his wife, Cynthia, from a so-called pleasure trip to the land of his Irish ancestors.
  
  While glad to be at home in Mitford, something is definitely missing: a pulpit. But when hes offered one, he decides he doesnt want it. Maybe hes lost his passion.
  
  His adopted son, Dooley, wrestles with his own passionfor the beautiful and gifted Lace Turner, and his vision to become a successful country vet. Dooleys brother, Sammy, still enraged by his mothers abandonment, destroys one of Father Tims prized possessions. And Hope Murphy, owner of Happy Endings bookstore, struggles with the potential loss of her unborn child and her hard-won business.
  
  All this as Wandas Feel Good Caf opens, a romance catches fire through an Internet word game, their former mayor hatches a reelection campaign to throw the bums out, and the weekly
  
   Muse
  
  poses a probing inquiry: Does Mitford still take care of its own?
  
  Millions of fans will applaud the chance to spend time, once more, in the often comic and utterly human presence of Jan Karons characters. Indeed, they have never been more sympathetic, bighearted, and engaging.
