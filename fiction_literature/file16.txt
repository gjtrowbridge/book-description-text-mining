  Tessa is a good girl with a sweet, reliable boyfriend back home. Shes got direction, ambition, and a mother whos intent on keeping her that way.
 
 
  But shes barely moved into her freshman dorm when she runs into Hardin. With his tousled brown hair, cocky British accent, tattoos, and lip ring, Hardin is cute and different from what shes used to.
 
 
  But hes also rudeto the point of cruelty, even. For all his attitude, Tessa
  
   should
  
  hate Hardin. And she doesuntil she finds herself alone with him in his room. Something about his dark mood grabs her, and when they kiss it ignites within her a passion shes never known before.
 
 
  Hell call her beautiful, then insist he isnt the one for her and disappear again and again. Despite the reckless way he treats her, Tessa is compelled to dig deeper and find the real Hardin beneath all his lies. He pushes her away again and again, yet every time she pushes back, he only pulls her in deeper.
 
 
  Tessa already has the perfect boyfriend. So why is she trying so hard to overcome her own hurt pride and Hardins prejudice about nice girls like her?
