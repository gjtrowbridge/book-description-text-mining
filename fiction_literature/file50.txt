  The art of love is never a science: Meet Don Tillman, a brilliant yet socially inept professor of genetics, whos decided its time he found a wife. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which Don approaches all things, he designs the Wife Project to find his perfect partner: a sixteen-page, scientifically valid survey to filter out the drinkers, the smokers, the late arrivers.
 
 
  Rosie Jarman possesses all these qualities. Don easily disqualifies her as a candidate for The Wife Project (even if she is quite intelligent for a barmaid). But Don is intrigued by Rosies own quest to identify her biological father. When an unlikely relationship develops as they collaborate on The Father Project, Don is forced to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosieand the realization that, despite your best scientific efforts, you dont find love, it finds you.
