  Where Flynne and her brother, Burton, live, jobs outside the drug business are rare. Fortunately, Burton has his veterans benefits, for neural damage he suffered from implants during his time in the USMCs elite Haptic Recon force. Then one night Burton has to go out, but theres a job hes supposed to doa job Flynne didnt know he had. Beta-testing part of a new game, he tells her. The job seems to be simple: work a perimeter around the image of a tower building. Little buglike things turn up. Hes supposed to get in their way, edge them back. Thats all there is to it. Hes offering Flynne a good price to take over for him. What she sees, though, isnt what Burton told her to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder.
