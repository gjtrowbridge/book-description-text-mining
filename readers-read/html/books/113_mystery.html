		<P><B>ONE</B></P>
<BR>
<P>Medicine Creek, Kansas. Early August. Sunset.</P>

<P>The great sea of yellow corn stretches from horizon to horizon
under an angry sky. When the wind rises the corn stirs and rustles as if
alive, and when the wind dies down again the corn falls silent. The heat
wave is now in its third week, and dead air hovers over the corn in
shimmering curtains.</P>

<P>One road cuts through the corn from north to south; another from
east to west. Where the two roads cross lies the town. Sad gray buildings
huddle together at the intersection, gradually thinning along both
roads into separate houses, then scattered farms, and then nothing. A
creek, edged by scraggly trees, wanders in from the northwest, loops
lazily around the town, and disappears in the southeast. It is the only
curved thing in this landscape of straight lines. To the northeast rises a
cluster of mounds surrounded by trees.</P>

<P>A giant slaughterhouse stands south of the town, lost in the corn,
its metal sides scoured by years of dust storms. The faint odor of blood
and disinfectant drifts in a plume southward from the plant, riding the
fitful currents of air. Beyond, just over the horizon, stand three gigantic
grain silos, like a tall-masted ship lost at sea.</P>

<P>The temperature is exactly one hundred degrees. Heat lightning
flickers silently along the distant northern horizon. The corn is seven
feet high, the fat cobs clustered on the stalks. Harvest is two weeks away.
One.Twilight is falling over the landscape. The orange sky bleeds away
into red. A handful of streetlights blink on in the town.
A black-and-white police cruiser passes along the main street, heading
east into the great nothingness of corn, its headlights stabbing into
the rising darkness. Some three miles ahead of the cruiser, a column of
slow-circling turkey vultures rides a thermal above the corn. They
wheel down, then rise up again, circling endlessly, uneasily, rising and
falling in a regular cadence.</P>

<BR>
<P>Sheriff Dent Hazen fiddled with the dashboard knobs and cursed at the
tepid air that streamed from the vents. He felt the vent with the back of
his hand but it wasn't getting any cooler: the AC had finally bit the dust.
He muttered another imprecation and cranked down the window, tossing
out his cigarette butt. Furnacelike air boiled in, and the cruiser filled
with the smell of late-summer Kansas: earth, cornstalks. He could see
the circling turkey buzzards rise and dip, rise and dip above the dying
smear of sunset along the horizon. <EM>One ugly motherfucker of a bird,</EM>
thought Hazen, and he glanced over at the long-barreled Winchester
Defender lying on the seat beside him. With any luck, he'd get close
enough to assist two or three of them into the next world.</P>

<P>He slowed and glanced once again at the dark birds silhouetted
against the sky. <EM>Why the hell aren't any of them landing?</EM> Turning off the main road, he eased the cruiser onto one of the many rutted dirt lanes that cut their way through the thousand square miles of corn surrounding Medicine Creek. He moved forward, keeping a watch on the sky,
until the birds were almost directly overhead. This was as close as he
was going to get by car. From here, he'd have to walk.</P>

<P>He threw the cruiser into park and, more out of habit than necessity,
snapped on the lightbar flashers. He eased his frame out of the
cruiser and stood for a moment facing the wall of corn, drawing a
rough hand across his stubbled chin. The rows went in the wrong
direction and it was going to be a bitch getting through them. Just the
thought of shouldering through all those rows made him weary, and
for a moment he thought about putting the cruiser in reverse and getting
the hell back to town. But it was too late for that now: the neigh-bor's
call had already been logged. Old Wilma Lowry had nothing
better to do but look out her window and report the location of dead
animals. But this was his last call of the day, and a few extra hours on
Friday evening at least guaranteed him a long, lazy, boozy Sunday fishing
at Hamilton Lake State Park.</P>

<P>Hazen lit another cigarette, coughed, and scratched himself, looking
at the dry ranks of corn. He wondered if it was somebody's cow
who'd wandered into the corn and was now dead of bloat and greed.
Since when was it a sheriff 's responsibility to check on dead livestock?
But he already knew the answer: ever since the livestock inspector
retired. There was nobody to take his place and no longer a need for
one. Every year there were fewer family farms, fewer livestock, fewer
people. Most people only kept cows and horses for nostalgic reasons.
The whole county was going to hell.</P>

<P>Realizing he'd put off the task long enough, Hazen sighed, hiked
up his jangling service belt, slipped his flashlight out of its scabbard,
shouldered the shotgun, and pushed his way into the corn.</P>
<P>Despite the lateness of the hour, the sultry air refused to lift. The
beam of his light flashed through the cornstalks stretching before him
like endless rows of prison bars. His nose filled with the smell of dry
stalks, that peculiar rusty smell so familiar it was part of his very being.
His feet crunched dry clods of earth, kicking up dust. It had been a wet
spring, and until the heat wave kicked in a few weeks back the summer
sun had been benevolent. The stalks were as high as Hazen could ever
remember, at least a foot or more over his head. Amazing how fast the
black earth could turn to dust without rain. Once, as a kid, he'd run
into a cornfield to escape his older brother and gotten lost. For two
hours. The disorientation he'd felt then came back to him now. Inside
the corn rows, the air felt trapped: hot, fetid, itchy.</P>

<P>Hazen took a deep drag on the cigarette and continued forward,
knocking the fat cobs aside with irritation. The field belonged to
Buswell Agricon of Atlanta, and Sheriff Hazen could not have cared
less if they lost a few ears because of his rough passage. Within two
weeks Agricon's huge combine harvesters would appear on the horizon,
mowing down the corn, each feeding half a dozen streams of kernels
into their hoppers. The corn would be trucked to the cluster of huge
grain silos just over the northern horizon and from there railed to feed
lots from Nebraska to Missouri, to disappear down the throats of
mindless castrated cattle, which would in turn be transformed into big
fat marbled sirloins for rich assholes in New York and Tokyo. Or
maybe this was one of those gasohol fields, where the corn wasn't eaten
by man or even beast but burned up in the engines of cars instead.
What a world.</P>

<P>Hazen bullied his way through row after row. Already his nose was
running. He tossed his cigarette away, then realized he should probably
have pinched it off first. Hell with it. A thousand acres of the damn
corn could burn and Buswell Agricon wouldn't even notice. They
should take care of their own fields, pick up their own dead animals.
Of course, the executives had probably never set foot in a real cornfield
in their lives.</P>

<P>Like almost everyone else in Medicine Creek, Hazen came from a
farming family that no longer farmed. They had sold their land to
companies like Buswell Agricon. The population of Medicine Creek
had been dropping for more than half a century and the great industrial
cornfields were now dotted with abandoned houses, their empty
window frames staring like dead eyes over the billowy main of crops.
But Hazen had stayed. Not that he liked Medicine Creek particularly;
what he liked was wearing a uniform and being respected. He liked the
town because he knew the town, every last person, every dark corner,
every nasty secret. Truth was, he simply couldn't imagine himself anywhere
else. He was as much a part of Medicine Creek as Medicine
Creek was a part of him.</P>

<P>Hazen stopped suddenly. He swept his beam through the stalks
ahead. The air, full of dust, now carried another smell: the perfume of
decay. He glanced up. The buzzards were far above now, directly over
his head. Another fifty yards and he would be there. The air was still,
the silence complete. He unshouldered his shotgun and moved forward
more cautiously.</P>

<P>The smell of decay drifted through the rows, sweeter by the
moment. Now Hazen could make out a gap in the corn, a clearing
directly ahead of him. Odd. The sky had flamed its red farewell and
was now dark.</P>

<P>The sheriff raised his gun, eased off the safety with his thumb, and
broke through the last corn row into the clearing. For a moment he
looked around in wild incomprehension. And then, rather suddenly,
he realized what he was looking at.</P>

<P>The gun went off when it hit the ground and the load of double-ought
buckshot blew by Hazen's ear. But the sheriff barely noticed.
