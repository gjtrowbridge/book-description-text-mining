                  <H3>Chapter One</H3>
                  <H4>Challenger</H4></CENTER>
                  <P>For most of the past thirteen years, I have used a
                  different name, chosen by me and approved by our government,
                  to perform the task appointed to me by the people of the
                  United States. This name, my professional name, I will not
                  tell you.</P>
                  <P>I am a foot soldier in the most feared, hated, and maligned
                  agency in the federal government.</P>
                  <P>I work for the Treasury. I execute Title 26 of the United
                  States Code, for the Internal Revenue Service -- or the
                  Service, as we in the trenches call it.</P>
                  <P>I collect taxes, but don't call me a tax collector. Nobody
                  wants to be a tax collector. Call me what the Service calls
                  me. Call me a revenue officer.</P>
                  <P>And hear my confession.</P>
                  <P><B>November 1990</B></P>
                  <P>"Okay, Rick, let's start. Why do you want to be a revenue
                  officer?"</P>
                  <P>I was sitting in a small conference room in Tampa, across
                  the table from Jim Neyland, chief of the Tampa branch of the
                  Jacksonville District of the Internal Revenue Service. It was
                  after-hours. His tie was loose around his neck and his
                  shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows. He was about fifty, with
                  thinning salt-and-pepper hair and a bushy black mustache. I
                  had just turned twenty-eight, and was wearing a ten-year-old
                  suit with a ten-day-old dark blue tie. The interview had been
                  scheduled to begin an hour earlier, but I had waited in the
                  reception area of the branch office, while his secretary
                  fussed at her desk and his loud voice boomed throughout the
                  office as he made dinner arrangements on the phone. There were
                  no magazines to read, no television to stare blankly at while
                  I waited. In one corner sat a dusty plastic palm tree. The
                  carpeting was dark blue. The divider separating the
                  secretary's workstation from the waiting area was white. The
                  ceiling was white. On the white wall directly opposite me were
                  two large framed photographs, one of the Sunshine Skyway
                  Bridge and another of the space shuttle Challenger. The bridge
                  had collapsed into Tampa Bay in 1980, killing thirty-five
                  people. Challenger had exploded in 1986, seconds after the
                  photograph was taken.</P>
                  <P>Jim Neyland did not want Chinese. He wanted barbecue. He
                  had been thinking about it all day, and his heart was set on
                  barbecue. He hated Chinese; he was always hungry again thirty
                  minutes later. He wanted some barbecue pork and some beans and
                  corn on the cob and some coleslaw and he didn't give a good
                  goddamn what everybody else wanted. No, not Italian, either.
                  There would be no compromise where he was concerned. It was
                  barbecue or nothing. The secretary flashed an apologetic smile
                  in my direction and buzzed him again. "Mr. Yancey is here for
                  his interview." He apparently didn't hear her. I examined my
                  new tie for any picks, stains, or hitherto unnoticed blotches.
                  I had to urinate, but knew the moment I bolted for the
                  bathroom, Jim Neyland would turn the corner from the inner
                  recesses of his office, looking for me. I stared at the
                  picture of Challenger. Like most Americans, I could remember
                  exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard the
                  news. How long ago that seemed -- a lifetime or two. And now I
                  was here, four months after answering an ad in the newspaper,
                  more on a whim than design. My destination, my mission, was
                  not as clearly defined as Challenger's, but in its own way was
                  no less perilous.</P>
                  <P>"I need the job," I answered. I had decided not to repeat
                  the preface I had used in my second interview, which had taken
                  place two weeks prior to this one: Well, I never dreamed of
                  being a tax collector when I grew up. This had not gone over
                  well with one of my interrogators. "And it sounds like very
                  interesting work."</P>
                  <P>"Well, you'll never be bored," Jim Neyland said. He picked
                  up a folder and opened it. I could see my name printed on its
                  face in large black letters: Yancey, John Richard. Inside were
                  my application and notes from the first two interviews. I
                  folded my hands in my lap, rubbing the tips of my thumbs
                  against my slick palms. There was a motel-room quality print
                  of a beach scene on the wall behind Jim Neyland, with a lone
                  seagull perched on a picket fence, staring out over the dark
                  ocean.</P>
                  <P>"So, you went to law school." His hair was thinning at the
                  crown, a perfectly round bald spot about the size of a golf
                  ball. Curly black hair carpeted his forearms. </P>
                  <P>"For a year."</P>
                  <P>"What happened?"</P>
                  <P>"I left."</P>
                  <P>"You dropped out?"</P>
                  <P>"I dropped out."</P>
                  <P>"Why did you drop out?"</P>
                  <P>"I decided it wasn't for me."</P>
                  <P>"It took you a year to figure that out?"</P>
                  <P>"I was kind of trying to live up to someone else's
                  expectations." My father was a lawyer, as was my brother.</P>
                  <P>"Need a job to pay off the loans?" His tone was friendly;
                  he seemed genuinely interested.</P>
                  <P>"Among other things."</P>
                  <P>He turned a page. "Boy, you've had quite a few jobs over
                  the years."</P>
                  <P>"Well, the application said list everything for the past
                  ten years." I stopped. I sounded defensive. </P>
                  <P>He ignored me. "Typesetter. Drama teacher. English
                  professor...your degree is in English?"</P>
                  <P>"That's right."</P>
                  <P>"What the hell did you think you were going to do with
                  that?" The question was rhetorical. He continued,
                  "Dramaturge...what the hell is a dramaturge?"</P>
                  <P>"Someone who analyzes drama."</P>
                  <P>"They pay you to analyze that?"</P>
                  <P>"Not much."</P>
                  <P>"Playwright. Convenience store manager. Ranch hand. Ranch
                  hand?"</P>
                  <P>"Sort of the family business."</P>
                  <P>"Get along lil' doggies!"</P>
                  <P>I managed to laugh.</P>
                  <P>"Anything you haven't done?"</P>
                  <P>"Singing telegrams."</P>
                  <P>"Anything you won't do?"</P>
                  <P>"Singing telegrams."</P>
                  <P>"What's your deal, Rick, besides comedy? I mean, what do
                  you want to be when you grow up?"</P>
                  <P>He slapped the file closed and leaned back in his chair,
                  cupping the back of his head with both hands, fingers laced
                  ...
