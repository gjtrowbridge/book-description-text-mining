&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be taught . . .&#8221;<br><br>You&#8217;ve got to be taught before . . .<br><br>Before you are six or seven or eight.<br><br>&#8212;Rodgers and Hammerstein<br><br>Lyrics from South Pacific<br><br>Mohammed Ghandour is a child of Lebanon, born into the desperately poor  slums of south Beirut. Packed with Palestinian refugees and Shiite  Muslim migrants from the south, the area is called the &#8220;Belt of  Misery.&#8221; But when Mohammed was four years old, his bedtime routine was  like that of millions of kids in the comfortably affluent suburbs of  the United States. Mohammed took out the same video every evening. And  after he put the cassette into the video player, he called his baby  sister to join him. The two children sat side by side before the  television every evening and watched a story that soon enough was not  only familiar, but thoroughly ingrained in their young minds.<br><br>What parent&#8217;s heart wouldn&#8217;t be touched by this image of tender  childhood? Who would not want to reach into this charming picture,  tousle the moppets&#8217; hair, and pull them close for a kiss? But Mohammed  and his sister weren&#8217;t watching visual lollipops served up by the likes  of Barney, the Teletubbies, or Baby Einstein. They weren&#8217;t learning the  joys of playground toysharing, the mysteries of counting, or the  thrills of reading. In the flickering blue light of the tiny television  in a small room deep in the winding alleys of a fetid slum, Mohammed  and his baby sister watched a suicide bombing, a real suicide bombing&#8212;a  five-minute film of Mohammed&#8217;s father, Salah Ghandour, ramming a car  stuffed with 990 pounds of explosives into an Israeli convoy in south  Lebanon.<br><br>&#8220;There&#8217;s my daddy,&#8221; Mohammed proudly exclaimed to a visitor at the  climactic moment when the image of the crudely produced film flashed  into the rolling orange and black ball of a terrible explosion. That  massive blast ripped Mohammed&#8217;s father to shreds and killed a dozen  Israeli soldiers.1<br><br>&#8220;There&#8217;s my daddy.&#8221; What seems horrible to Western sensibilities is not  only glorified as the holiest of acts within radical Islam, but is  taught to children with the same facility and intensity that MTV  teaches American kids the latest music and language trends. In a  thousand ways every day children like young Mohammed are taught that  the suicide bomber not only offers self-sacrifice in the service of an  excruciatingly grim God, but an express ticket to the highest rewards  of Heaven. Public processions at the funerals of Islamic terrorists and  the demonstration marches of radical Islamic groups feature children  carrying AK-47 rifles and wearing belts of fake explosives&#8212;belts just  like those worn by real suicide bombers not much older than they.  Nothing more sharply defines the vast chasm between Islamic extremism  and the West, their different views of the value of life itself, than  these poignant images of children playing at martyrdom.<br><br>Salah Ghandour&#8217;s self-immolation was an act of terrorism committed&#8212;and  recorded in progress for a sophisticated program of media and  propaganda use&#8212;by an organization that terrorism experts call the  &#8220;A-Team&#8221; of international terrorism: Hezbollah, the &#8220;Party of God.&#8221;  Founded in 1982 with the help of Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s Islamic  Revolutionary Guard (IRG), headquartered in Lebanon, closely allied  with and supported by Iran, Hezbollah held the record for terrorist  murders of Americans before al Qaeda seized that grisly distinction  with the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001. Hezbollah,  constituted as a political party in Lebanon, is known to have warm  links with al Qaeda. According to the Final Report of the National  Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (&#8220;9/11  Commission Report&#8221;) issued in July 2004, &#8220;Al Qaeda members received  advice and training from Hezbollah.&#8221; This statement confirms  information documented elsewhere in this book. The 9/11 Commission  Report also describes the contacts of senior Hezbollah members with the  hijackers who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, and  advises that &#8220;this topic requires further investigation by the U.S.  government.&#8221;<br><br>Hezbollah still holds the record for terrorist killings of U.S.  military personnel&#8212;the murder of 241 U.S. marines, sailors, and  soldiers when a 12,000-pound Hezbollah truck bomb leveled their  barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983. It is operating in Iraq.<br><br>Just as Henry Ford did not invent the automobile but made it a  mass-produced fact of modern life, so Hezbollah did not invent the  suicide car bomb. But Hezbollah ruthlessly elevated this horrifically  indiscriminate device into the first choice of weapons in the sinister  toolbox of Middle Eastern terrorism. Large-scale suicide bombing, often  coordinated in multiple attacks, is a Hezbollah trademark. Some  counterterrorism experts believe that a man named Imad  Mugniyah&#8212;Hezbollah&#8217;s operations chief, wanted by the United  States&#8212;taught this concept of rolling destruction to Osama bin Laden in  1994, seven years before the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001.  Sanctioned suicide pioneered by Hezbollah has made mass murder by  explosive numbingly routine, not only in the Middle East, but around  the world.<br><br>Hezbollah is neither a remote curio of Lebanon nor an organization  whose activity is limited to the Middle East. The Party of God has  intertwined itself like a noxious vine around the vast Lebanese  diaspora, a worldwide expatriate community of traders and merchants.  Silently, deliberately, and all but invisibly, its cohorts have  infiltrated the United States and its neighbors, Canada and Latin  America. Hezbollah is here, now. Hezbollah cadres are known to have  been planted in at least fourteen cities in the United States, places  as unlikely as Houston, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Charlotte,  North Carolina. Its American cells are led by dedicated, coldly  calculating men who grew up on the same stark diet of fanatical hatred  of the West that is fed daily to millions of children like young  Mohammed Ghandour. Carefully&#8212;but sometimes audaciously, a measure of  their contempt for U.S. law enforcement authorities&#8212;Hezbollah&#8217;s  operatives have woven themselves into the American tapestry.<br><br>These hidden agents of hatred have taken advantage of America&#8217;s  cultural openness and exploited our civil liberties to raise funds and  acquire military equipment illegally shipped abroad to support  Hezbollah&#8217;s war of terror against the West. They have engaged in  military training and raised millions of illicit dollars through a  ruthless catalog of criminal enterprises, including large-scale  cigarette smuggling and tax evasion schemes, credit card fraud, drug  running, gun trafficking, Internet pornography, and an array of other  criminal schemes. Lying effortlessly and continuously, they have  cynically duped ordinary Americans into unknowingly aiding their terror  operations, often by appealing to simple greed and a willingness to  dismiss low-level criminal acts as &#8220;not really that bad.&#8221;<br><br>Most ominously, Hezbollah&#8217;s minions lurk in sleeper cells, willing,  able, and waiting only for the command of their masters in Beirut and  Tehran to commit acts of violent terror on American soil. No one who  understands Hezbollah&#8217;s history doubts for a second its ability to  inflict horrible damage should it choose to do so. According to FBI  officials, serious credence was given to fears of a Hezbollah plot to  assassinate President Clinton&#8217;s National Security Adviser, Anthony  (Tony) Lake. In 1995 there was enough concern to have Lake move out of  his home into the more secure quarters of Blair House, the nation&#8217;s  official guest residence opposite the White House.<br><br>The threat is not theoretical. Hezbollah&#8217;s dark talents have been  gruesomely demonstrated in the Western Hemisphere by sophisticated  bombing attacks in Argentina. Hezbollah sleeper cells&#8212;constituted much  like those in the United States&#8212;are known to exist in an area of South  America known as the Tri-Border region of Brazil, Argentina, and  Paraguay. These cells cooperated with the Iranian secret service to  carry out two horrific signature bombings in Argentina. On March 17,  1992, the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was struck by a suicide  bomber, killing 29. And on July 18, 1994, another powerful bomb  destroyed the main building of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Aid  Association (AMIA) on a busy street in downtown Buenos Aires. That bomb  killed 86 and wounded 300, the greatest loss of Jewish life in a  terrorist incident outside Israel since the Second World War. A senior  staff member of a committee of the U.S. Congress regards the Argentine  bombings as, in part, a not-so-subtle Hezbollah signal to the United  States. &#8220;The message is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we did it there. We can do it  here.&#8221;<br><br>Just as distant thunder warns of the fury of a coming storm, the  presence of these Hezbollah cells in America warns of a frightening  potential from a body of killers said by one American intelligence  expert to make Osama bin Laden&#8217;s al Qaeda &#8220;look like a bunch of  kindergartners.&#8221; Fortunately, a small band of extremely talented men  and women from the ranks of local and federal law enforcement, together  with a team of equally talented prosecutors, have dedicated much of  their lives to rooting out Hezbollah&#8217;s weeds in America. The almost  serendipitous coming together of a handful of these able men and women  exposed and successfully prosecuted one major Hezbollah cell in the  most unlikely of places&#8212;Charlotte, North Carolina. They continue  working to unravel a tangle of other cells rooted deeply in other  unsuspecting American communities.<br><br>This is the story of Hezbollah&#8217;s invasion of America, and of the thin  line of defense upon which American lives depend. It describes in  microcosm virtually all of the issues raised by and investigated by the  9/11 Commission&#8212;with one major difference. These extraordinary men and  women overcame the obstacles that blinded America to the coming attack  by al Qaeda, and succeeded in exposing Hezbollah&#8217;s operations. But one  part of this story cannot be told, because it remains unknown&#8212;and that  is whether even more hidden layers of Hezbollah&#8217;s dark enterprise lie  undetected, coiled to strike in America.<br><br>The Bourj al-Barajneh neighborhood lies about ten miles to the  southeast of downtown Beirut, not far from the headquarters of  Hezbollah. What strikes many visitors first is the pervasive stench  from the vast heap of an open garbage dump, swarming with dark clouds  of flies, at the entrance of an eponymous refugee camp for  Palestinians. The Bourj al-Barajneh refugee camp, established after the  creation of Israel and the partition of Palestine in 1947&#8211;48, blends  into the surrounding Lebanese neighborhoods. Its borders are  indistinguishable to the visitor, although Palestinians and Lebanese  know precisely where the boundaries lie. In any case, the camp and the  surrounding neighborhoods are grindingly poor warrens, labyrinths of  narrow paths barely deserving to be called alleys, rank with open  sewers and the acrid smell of stale urine, littered with garbage,  spiderwebbed with makeshift electrical connections, drunken with  bootleg utility piping, and above all, dark with despair. The encamped  Palestinians have been virtually ignored by Arab governments for more  than fifty years, with the exception of the occasional trotting out of  refugee misery for purposes of international incitement. Their children  are regularly rallied to dance and cheer upon news of the latest  suicide bombing in Israel.<br><br>The other residents of Bourj al-Barajneh, packed cheek by jowl with the  Palestinians, are poor Shiite Muslims, &#233;migr&#233;s from Lebanon&#8217;s rural  south. The Shiites are a minority Muslim denomination that broke off  from the majority Sunni faithful in the seventh century, persecuted  ever since as a heretical sect. Shiites, however, are the majority in  Iran. They are also strongly represented in Iraq, where they were  viciously suppressed by its erstwhile dictator, Saddam Hussein, and  remain ungratefully and violently rebellious in the wake of the  American invasion of Iraq in 2003. In Lebanon, most Shiites were  farmers, living for centuries in numbing medieval rural servitude in  the south. Desperately poor, badly organized, and long-suffering under  the dominant Sunnis&#8212;Islam&#8217;s majority wing&#8212;the Shiites in Lebanon were  traditionally friendly with Israel, Lebanon&#8217;s southern neighbor. During  the 1970s some Shiites even fought alongside Israeli soldiers against  the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as members of the  Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA).<br><br>The Shiites began immigrating to the city&#8217;s suburbs in the 1970s, under  pressure from the successive invasions of Yasser Arafat&#8217;s PLO&#8212;expelled  from Jordan in 1970&#8212;and an Israeli army determined in 1982 to eradicate  the PLO after suffering a decade of cross-border terrorist raids and  rocket attacks mounted by the PLO from Lebanon. The Israelis&#8217;  heavy-handed treatment of the Shiites played into the agenda of  Israel&#8217;s radical Islamic foes.<br><br>The occupation of the south soon destroyed the earlier amicable  relations and turned Lebanon&#8217;s Shiites into implacable enemies. Israeli  officers and soldiers who once motored leisurely home through south  Lebanon on weekend passes found themselves the targets of Shiite  ambushes and suicide attacks, like that committed by Salah Ghandour and  enshrined by his son.<br><br>Like many such centers of rural-to-urban emigration in less developed  parts of the world, Bourj al-Barajneh became a hellhole of futility,  its residents trapped in endless poverty, the victims of and  participants in rolling waves of violence over the beginnings and ends  of which they had no control. The chronic cancer of despair thrived.  The male children born into these hopeless streets quickly became  willing grist for the mills of an array of armed militias that  succeeded one another in archaeological layers of violence. The violent  process culminated with the Hezbollah terror machine controlling the  area.<br><br>Mohammed Youssef Hammoud came kicking and screaming into the pitiless  world of Bourj al-Barajneh on September 25, 1973. The Hammoud family  was devoutly religious, one to whom Shiite clerics and saints, and some  lay leaders, were figures of reverent authority. The hand of centuries  of Islam and Shiite doctrinal history touched the infant Mohammed at  his birth. Like many such families, the Hammoud family grew large  beyond the means of its poverty. Mohammed Hammoud was one of five  brothers and seven sisters. In addition to the ties of his immediate  family, young Mohammed was born into the intense bonds of a network of  clan and extended family. The physical and social closeness of Bourj  al-Barajneh creates a world in which one&#8217;s business is at once both no  one&#8217;s and everyone&#8217;s. Cousins and close friends would turn up time and  again in Mohammed&#8217;s life, far from Lebanon.<br><br>The tumult of the larger Middle East conflict marked every milestone in  Mohammed&#8217;s young life. On October 6, 1973, scarcely two weeks after his  birth, Syria and Egypt struck Israel in a surprise attack on Yom  Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish religious calendar. Only  emergency aid from the United States saved Israel from a military  setback that could have threatened the Jewish state&#8217;s existence.  Discussion of the war, its impact, and America&#8217;s role burned hotly  through Bourj al-Barajneh, as it did everywhere on the &#8220;Arab street.&#8221;  In the United States, however, ordinary Americans were more focused on  relief over the end of the Vietnam War&#8212;the Paris Peace Accords had been  signed only in January&#8212;and frustration over the impact of an oil  embargo that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  imposed on the West in retaliation for aid to Israel. The Arab embargo  set off a recession, and the price of gasoline soared in America from  30 cents a gallon to about $1.20 in the worst days. Those events  generated a brief flurry of crudely stereotypical ethnic attacks on the  Arabs. But the subtleties of the longer term implications of the  Arab&#8211;Israeli struggle simply failed to interest most Americans.</font><br>
