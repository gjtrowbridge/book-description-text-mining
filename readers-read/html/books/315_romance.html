<H4 align=center>Chapter One</H4>
                  <P>"WHAT THE HELL DOES HE THINK HEï¿½S DOING!" as the car
                  lurched forward, Tom fought to keep control. He had been taken
                  by surprise when the car following seemed to deliberately
                  crash into his bumper.</P>
                  <P>"He's coming at us again, Daddy!" The two children in the
                  back were thrown hard against the seat-backs by the first
                  bump. They screamed a warning as the other car surged toward
                  them a second time. There was a moment of chaos before the
                  impact sent them hurtling toward the clifftops. "JESUS!" He
                  couldn't hold it! They were going over ... dear God, they were
                  going over, and there was nothing he could do!</P>
                  <P>In that split second as he tried desperately to swing the
                  car round, Tom glanced again through his rear-view mirror,
                  needing to know who his attacker was, why he would want to
                  hurt them. The car was a blue Hillman Minx, he thought, and
                  the driver was crouched over its steering wheel, with a
                  Homburg hat pulled low over his forehead and dark glasses
                  hiding his eyes. It was impossible to get any idea of what he
                  looked like. "Crazy bastard ... back off. BACK OFF!" In
                  response Tom felt the violent impact as they were hit again,
                  and again. Wrenched out of his hands, the steering wheel
                  seemed to spin out of control.</P>
                  <P>"God help us!" His wife's frightened voice penetrated the
                  chaos of his mind. "Children! Get down behind the seats!" she
                  ordered fearfully. He heard the pitiful whimperings of his two
                  children as they clung to each other. He saw his wife,
                  strangely silent now, her face shocked with disbelief as she
                  glanced back at their attacker. "My God!" Suddenly she was on
                  the seat, frantically attempting to reach the children, but it
                  was too late.</P>
                  <P>When the car rammed them yet again, they lurched forward,
                  the windscreen shattering all over them, the other driver
                  showing no mercy. Determined, he stayed with them, revving up,
                  sending them forward toward the edge, fast and furious.</P>
                  <P>Everything was happening so quickly ... a matter of
                  seconds, no more. There was no time to escape. By now the car
                  was badly dented; the doors were jammed tight. Tom had tried
                  everything in his power and it wasn't enough. All manner of
                  powerful emotions swept through him: disbelief; helplessness;
                  and now sheer horror as the car became airborne.</P>
                  <P>There was a moment of eeriness, when the car appeared to
                  pause in midair before the nose dipped and they fell into a
                  downward plunge toward the rocks below. "Oh, dear God!"
                  Throwing himself across his wife, he yelled for the kids to
                  "STAY DOWN! HOLD ONTO EACH OTHER!" He could hear them sobbing,
                  and now the soft, shivering sound of his wife's voice in
                  prayer. Death was only a heartbeat away.</P>
                  <P>He would not remember the thud as they bounced onto the
                  rocks and rolled over and over, crashing and breaking toward
                  the beach; nor would he recall the screams of people who
                  scattered in all directions as the car skidded at breakneck
                  speed toward the sea-edge. The clanging bells of the
                  ambulances and police cars as they rushed to help fell on deaf
                  ears. Like his wife and children, he was beyond all that.</P>
                  <P>The next thing he knew he had awoken in the hospital.
                  Bruised and battered, both his legs were broken and his neck
                  was in a brace. When he woke it was with a scream for the
                  children to "GET DOWN, KIDS ... HOLD ON!" In that unbelievable
                  moment, his mind was alive with the memory of what had
                  happened.</P>
                  <P>"It's all right ... ssh!" Gently the nurse settled him down
                  again, her heart aching for what he must soon learn. Later
                  they told him that there was nothing they could have done to
                  save Sheila or the children. "We tried and failed," the
                  surgeon told him, hands outstretched and an expression of
                  hopelessness on his kindly face. "I'm so sorry."</P>
                  <P>The car had turned over on top of them. Tom himself had
                  been thrown clear ... lucky to be alive,they said. But he
                  wasn't "lucky!" He was angry, seething with a need to kill.
                  Then he was sobbing, crippled with utter loneliness.</P>
                  <P>All through that terrible night the questions had burned
                  bright in his mind. Who was the madman who had run them off
                  the road? Why did he do it? WHY?</P>
                  <P>There were no answers, because in the months that followed,
                  in spite of the police relentlessly pursuing even the minutest
                  clue, the driver of that car was never found, nor was the car
                  itself. Tom had described both as accurately as he could, but
                  it was as though they had vanished off the face of the earth.
                  They had spoken to owners in the area whose cars had been
                  stolen around the time of the accident, but until and unless
                  they found the vehicle itself, that wasn't of much help.</P>
                  <P>When eventually Tom was released from the hospital, he too
                  made every effort to trace the man who had taken his family
                  and ruined his life. Time and again in the following months,
                  he returned to the scene, speaking with anyone who would
                  listen. All to no avail. The evil that had visited him and his
                  family seemed to have gone as swiftly as it came.</P>
                  <P>But the consequences of that fateful day would never leave
                  him. Neither would the hatred he felt.</P>
                  <P>Now, almost a year later, all that was left for Tom was the
                  awful nightmares when, in his deepest sleep, he would reenact
                  the terrifying scene, hearing his children screaming, and
                  Sheila, at first strangely silent, then frantically reaching
                  out to protect her children ... and all of them, helpless.</P>
                  <P>The dreams were so real and vivid, he would often wake up,
                  arms flailing, yelling for the children to, "Get down on the
                  floor, kids! FOR GOD'S SAKE, HOLD ON TO EACH OTHER!"</P>
