                  <H4>Introduction</H4></CENTER>
                  <P>Healthy Holidays.</P>
                  <P>It sounds like an oxymoron, right? It's right up there with
                  jumbo shrimp, slumber party, and working vacation. It's kind
                  of like saying "disciplined indulgence." I was telling a
                  friend of mine recently that I was writing a book called
                  <I>Healthy Holidays</I>, and he said, "Healthy holidays? Is
                  that even possible?" Well I'm here to tell you that not only
                  is it possible, it's guaranteed if you follow just a few
                  simple rules. After reading this book and enjoying a few
                  healthy holidays of your own, I'm sure you will agree that
                  making your holidays healthy is the best way to enjoy them to
                  their fullest.</P>
                  <P>I used to see every holiday as an opportunity to completely
                  fall apart. And I actually looked <I>forward</I> to falling
                  apart! I would even factor in recovery time, naturally
                  building it into my year. I would plan for those days of
                  indulgence and accept the consequences -- extra weight, puffy
                  face, watery eyes, stuffy nose, headache, constipation, and
                  bloating -- as though they were supposed to be a natural part
                  of the celebration. (Not to mention a pimple or two within the
                  following week!) To most of us, the essence of a holiday is
                  indulgence. And it should be. But overindulgence is often the
                  factor that ruins a holiday or party. The suffering usually
                  outweighs the pleasure, not to mention how dangerous it is for
                  our health.</P>
                  <P>The essence of a holiday is friends and family sharing and
                  celebrating with a meat that usually involves some kind of
                  guilty pleasure, a little naughty and perhaps a little
                  unhealthy, but one that we look forward to because it isn't a
                  part of our everyday routine. In fact, celebrating the
                  holidays is a way of balancing our routine. We work forty-plus
                  hours a week, and a holiday is a way of letting off steam and
                  taking a break from that work. We have been working hard and
                  have been mentally building toward a reward. Holidays are
                  usually celebrated on a weekend, now that most of them have
                  been moved to a convenient Monday, and the main objective is
                  to gather with friends and family, eat a little more, play a
                  little more, and drink a little more. In short: <I>live</I> a
                  little more. Sometimes <I>a lot</I> more!</P>
                  <P>Now I don't want you to think that this is a book about
                  avoiding those things we love during the holidays. It's not
                  about being overly disciplined on holidays or at parties --
                  you won't be eating only raw food at your next Thanksgiving
                  dinner. This book is about building a few simple corrective
                  actions right into your holiday routine so that you won't gain
                  weight or be sick, hung over, or forced to diet and detox for
                  days or weeks after the holiday. You're going to build a few
                  of the elements of detox and diet right into your day -- and
                  barely notice it.</P>
                  <P>This is analogous to sound financial planning. If your
                  overall goal is to be financially stable, it's best to budget
                  and have a balanced and secure financial plan. If you
                  overspend during the holidays and blow money carelessly on
                  every vacation, you're likely to go into debt -- unless, of
                  course, you are <I>extremely</I> wealthy. But you can never
                  reach a point with your health that would be equivalent to a
                  billionaire with his money. You can never be so healthy that
                  it would be possible to eat and drink large quantities of junk
                  and still be healthy and look great. And even though the most
                  affluent people can afford reckless spending, I find it
                  interesting that they usually tend to budget the most. It is
                  one of the main reasons the wealthy <I>stay</I> wealthy. And
                  that is the mentality I would like you to adopt regarding your
                  health. I want you to stay healthy and still thoroughly enjoy
                  the holidays -- in fact, you'll probably enjoy them more. And
                  you won't need to recover for three days afterward.</P>
                  <P>People are always going to overdo it. It's human nature to
                  want to contrast working hard with overindulging. But if you
                  can embrace little ways to keep yourself from falling off the
                  deep end, you will also teach your children some healthy
                  habits in the process. Balanced eating during the holidays is
                  a great message to send our kids. We teach them by showing a
                  good example, which plants the seed in their heads that
                  extreme eating habits are <I>not</I> a good idea. This is more
                  important than ever today, when there is so much junk food in
                  our children's environment compared to when we were growing
                  up, and so many more opportunities for them to pick up bad
                  habits.</P>
                  <P>When I was growing up, I would eagerly wait for the holiday
                  season, starting with Halloween. I knew I was going to be sick
                  the day after eating all that junk, but there was no way I was
                  going to skip even one candy corn. And after Thanksgiving
                  dinner, I knew I was going to be full and bloated and sick.
                  It's not just an American tradition to be miserable after
                  every holiday. It's the law! And we don't feet satisfied until
                  we are completely stuffed. It is our goal to actually become
                  the turkey.</P>
                  <P>I remember returning to school every January after
                  Christmas vacation, even when I was as young as fourth grade,
                  realizing "Oh my gosh, my uniform doesn't fit anymore." As a
                  teenager I would always begin a serious diet every January. I
                  know I'm not the only one who approached January this way. In
                  fact, most people still do. The average person gains seven or
                  eight pounds between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, and
                  everyone, at one time or another, attempts to change his or
                  her life beginning in January right after the big holiday
                  sweep. These attempts are called New Year's resolutions.</P>
                  <P>If you're familiar with my books <I>Marilu Henner's Total
                  Health Makeover</I>, <I>The 30-Day Total Health Makeover</I>,
                  and <I>Healthy Life Kitchen</I>, you know that one of the most
                  important elements I've strived for in developing the Total
                  Health Makeover (or THM) lifestyle over the past twentythree
                  years has been to find a way of eating that I could live with
                  every day. So, of course, much of this lifestyle had to be
                  flexible and forgiving, especially during the holidays. I have
                  always been somewhat of a party girl, so it was important for
                  me to find a way of getting through the holidays while still
                  indulging and enjoying myself. To this day, I associate
                  holidays with being a little naughty and eating and partying
                  too much, but now I don't fall apart. And I enjoy the holidays
                  now more than ever!</P>
                  <P>People always make fun of me for eating what they consider
                  to be a strict diet. They can't believe I have the discipline
                  to never eat meat, sugar, or dairy products. When I dine with
                  friends for the first time, they will often apologize for
                  ordering something that I would not eat myself. What they
                  don't realize is that flavor-wise and satisfaction-wise my
                  diet is identical to theirs. It's just healthier. My taste
                  buds now prefer healthier, better food.</P>
                  <P>I threw a holiday party once for three hundred people. I
                  carefully went over the THM guidelines with the caterer (no
                  meat, no sugar, no dairy). It was an endless feast with many
                  hors d'oeuvres, entr�es, desserts -- everything devilish you
                  can imagine. Because the food was so incredible, people said,
                  "Wow, you really broke the rules tonight, didn't you?" They
                  couldn't believe it when I told them that all the food fit
                  within the THM guidelines, and that not one item was served
                  that I would not eat myself. THM is simply a way to eat,
                  enjoy, indulge, and not feel sick the next day.</P>
                  <P>Have you ever gotten into really great shape, just to fall
                  apart? We get in shape to go on vacation, be someone's
                  Valentine, see our relatives at Christmas, fit into that
                  slinky Halloween costume or tight little black dress. We bust
                  our butts and do whatever we must to get in perfect shape, and
                  then blow it all in one night by going for everything we've
                  been missing. It's all about the entrance. You want to look
                  great for that moment when he, she, or they (whoever you've
                  been dieting for) see you for the first time. Once that moment
                  has passed, you relax and don't stop eating and drinking until
                  the party or holiday is over. You may be thinking, "Oh, big
                  deal! So I gain one or two or ten pounds over the holidays.
                  That will only set me back a few days." Well, I think a few
                  days five to ten times a year is a big deal! And it can be a
                  serious setback for your health, your appearance, <I>and</I>
                  your career. Even one overindulgent meal does measurable
                  damage to our bodies, especially our arteries. This conclusion
                  was reached after an extensive study conducted in Australia
                  recently. After consuming just one meal high in animal fat,
                  around fifty grams, the elasticity of a person's arterial
                  walls and impeding blood flow <I>drops by 27 percent</I>. And
                  this lasts for several hours.</P>
                  <P>It was a pattern for me every Christmas, when I first moved
                  to New York and later Los Angeles, to get in great physical
                  shape before I would go home to Chicago. It was important to
                  me to show that I was doing well on my own in a new city, and
                  I knew I would see old boyfriends, old friends, and my three
                  sisters and two grown-up nieces (you know how female relatives
                  can be). I would arrive and people would see me and say, "Wow!
                  You've lost weight! How'd you do it this time?" After that
                  initial presentation was over, it became my personal
                  responsibility to eat my way through Chicago. And for those of
                  you not familiar with that incredible city, Chicago is
                  <I>made</I> for eating! The bottom line was I got in great
                  shape so I would look good pigging out.</P>
                  <P>I was not the only one in my family who got in shape for
                  Christmas. It was funny to observe how everyone worked their
                  tight, hot clothes the first few days, but then the baggier
                  stuff would quickly creep into everybody's wardrobe. By New
                  Year's Day, everyone would be wearing big T-shirts, pajamas,
                  robes, and sweatpants. I always had thin legs no matter how
                  much I overindulged, so I could always wear short skirts or
                  leggings, but my tops would get bigger and puffier as my
                  waistline grew more undefined.</P>
                  <P>I would return to Los Angeles in January about twelve
                  pounds heavier, but it was not a big deal to me at the time. A
                  recovery period after every holiday was normal. I would always
                  make sure that I had at least one week off from business and
                  major social obligations, because I knew that when I got home,
                  I'd be overweight and constipated and my skin would be broken
                  out. For a week or two I would screen my calls or tell my
                  agent that I had pinkeye or something else until I reached a
                  respectable weight. When it comes to work, it's a shame we
                  can't call in <I>fat</I>! We should get seven or eight fat
                  days built into our work schedule per year, and a whole fat
                  week following Christmas.</P>
                  <P>After many years of research and experimentation, this
                  mentality ended for me, and now it can end for you. On this
                  program you will learn what to eat earlier in the day and what
                  to eat the day after so that your holiday meal will go right
                  through you. There are foods and activities that will keep
                  your body and digestion system functioning most efficiently,
                  and that is the key. It's all about taking out the trash. A
                  little naughty food and drink is not so bad if you rid your
                  body of it quickly and, most important, naturally. As I said,
                  it is building little pockets of discipline into your holiday
                  experience, and that little effort does the trick.</P>
                  <P>Always keep in mind that health is a total picture. The
                  essence of this book is about celebrating holidays in a
                  healthier way, and that goes much deeper than simply planning
                  what to eat. Food is only one of the elements to consider in
                  planning your holiday. There are many other exciting elements
                  -- holiday history, holiday memories, invitations,
                  decorations, toasts, scents, games and activities,
                  calorie-burning exercises, music, movies, party favors, and
                  just about anything else that can spice up a holiday. The idea
                  is to enjoy the holidays the way you did as a child and take
                  some of the attention away from the food. Trust me -- it gets
                  far too much attention as it is. It's like George Clooney at a
                  women's yoga class. I keep waiting for him to show up at mine!
                  The point is you never know when someone like George Clooney
                  is going to pop into your day. You've always got to be
                  prepared and look your best. And you can't consistently allow
                  the holidays to set you back and force you into hiding. Let's
                  start a year of healthy holidays together, from New Year's Day
                  to New Year's Eve. I'm sure they'll be the best holidays
                  ever!</P>

                  <P>Preheat the oven to 400�F.</P>
                  <P>Pull the fat from inside the chicken and discard. Set the
                  chicken in a small roasting pan and put the whole garlic
                  cloves under the skin in the meatiest part of the chicken.
                  Stuff the chicken with 3 rosemary sprigs. Pour the oil over
                  chicken and sprinkle it with the salt and pepper to taste. Rub
                  the oil and seasonings into the chicken. Tuck 3 rosemary
                  sprigs under the chicken. Roast the chicken, uncovered,
                  basting ocassionally, about 1 hour, or until the chicken
                  juices run clear. Remove the rosemary from the chicken and
                  from the pan. Carve the chicken and put the pieces on a
                  platter. Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs. Skim the excess
                  fat from the roasting juices and add salt and pepper to taste.
                  When serving, spoon a little of the pan juices over the
                  chicken.</P><!------------------------------------------------------------><!--ENDING chapter excerpt--><!--RESUME EDIT--><!--DO NOT EDIT--><!--BEGINNING writeBookFooter--><!------------------------------------------------------------>
