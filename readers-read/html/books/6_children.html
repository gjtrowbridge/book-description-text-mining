                  Resources<BR>The New York Journal<BR>216 W. 57th Street<BR>New
                  York, NY 10019<BR>212-555-6891</P>
                  <P>Ida D. Lopez<BR>Craft Food Services<BR>The New York
                  Journal<BR>216 W. 57th Street<BR>New York, NY 10019</P>
                  <P>Dear Mrs. Lopez:</P>
                  <P>Last week, we met to address your continuing
                  job-performance problems related to the <STRIKE>giving out of
                  dissemination of</STRIKE> serving of items from the dessert
                  cart you operate in the newspaper's senior staff dining room.
                  These problems have persisted despite repeated counseling
                  sessions with <STRIKE>me my boss Amy Jenkins</STRIKE>
                  supervisors as well as staff training programs. Specifically,
                  your refusal to <STRIKE>give disseminate</STRIKE> serve
                  dessert to certain members of the senior staff has resulted in
                  several written complaints from administrators at this
                  <STRIKE>establishment paper</STRIKE> company.</P>
                  <P>Mrs. Lopez, your refusal to serve dessert to certain
                  members of the paper's staff is disruptive to food service
                  operations, and the explanations that you have provided for
                  your behavior are not <STRIKE>satisfactory wholly believable
                  inexplicable</STRIKE> acceptable. This letter is being issued
                  as a written warning with the expectation that there will be
                  an immediate and sustained improvement in your <STRIKE>work
                  attitude food service dissemination</STRIKE> job performance.
                  Failure to comply will result in further disciplinary
                  action.</P>
                  <P>On a more personal note, Mrs. Lopez, please stop refusing
                  to give senior staff members dessert, even if you feel, as you
                  explained to me last week, that they don't "deserve it." Which
                  members of the paper's staff do or do not deserve dessert is
                  not your decision to make! And I would hate to see you asked
                  to leave the food craft services department over something so
                  silly! I would really miss you -- and your chocolate chip
                  cookies!</P>
                  <P>Damn it.</P>
                  <P align=center>From the Desk of<BR>Kate Mackenzie</P>

                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> What are you doing?</P>
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> WORKING. Stop IM-ing me, you know the
                  T.O.D. doesn't like it when we IM during office hours.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> The T.O.D. can bite me. And you
                  are not working. I can see your desk from here. You're making
                  another one of those To Do lists, aren't you?
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> It may look like I'm making a To Do list,
                  but really I am reflecting on the series of failures and bad
                  judgment calls that have made up my life.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Oh my God, you are twenty-five
                  years old. You have not even had a life yet.
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> Then why am I in such mental and emotional
                  anguish?
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Because you stayed up too late
                  last night watching <I>Charmed</I> reruns. Don't try to deny
                  it, I heard you salivating over Cole.
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!!!!!!! Did I keep
                  you and Craig awake?
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Please. Craig would sleep through
                  a nuclear blast. And I only heard you because I got up to use
                  the bathroom. These hormones make me have to go every five
                  minutes.
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> I am so, so sorry. I swear I will be off
                  your couch and out of your place just as soon as I get a line
                  on a studio I can afford. Paula's taking me to look at one
                  tomorrow night in Hoboken. $1100/month, third-floor walk-up.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Would you stop? I told you, we
                  like having you stay with us.
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> Jen, you and Craig are trying to have a
                  BABY. You do not need an old college roommate sacking out on
                  your living room couch while you are trying to procreate. You
                  did enough just getting me this job in the first place.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> You more than earn your keep with
                  all the cleaning you do. Don't think I haven't noticed. Craig
                  even pointed out this morning that you had dusted the top of
                  the refrigerator. Obsessive much, by the way? Who even looks
                  at the top of the refrigerator?
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> Well, Craig, OBVIOUSLY.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Whatever. You can't afford
                  $1100/month on your salary. I know how much you make,
                  remember?
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> It's the cheapest place Paula's found me so
                  far. That isn't on the same block as a methadone clinic.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> I don't understand why YOU are the
                  one who had to move out. Why didn't you kick HIM out?
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> I can't stay in that apartment. Not with
                  the memories of all the happy times Dale and I shared.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> Oh, you mean like all those times
                  you came home from work to find that, like, one of his
                  bandmates had mistaken the closet for the bathroom and peed on
                  your suede boots?
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT UP AT WORK?
                  You know it always makes me want to cry. I really loved those
                  boots. They were perfect Coach knockoffs.
                  <P><B>Sleaterkinneyfan:</B> You should have thrown his stuff
                  out onto the fire escape and changed the locks. "I don't know
                  if I can marry you after all, I have to take things one day at
                  a time." I mean, what kind of thing is that for a guy to
                  say?????
                  <P><B>Katydid:</B> Um, the kind of thing an ex-pothead who is
                  about to land a million-dollar recording contract would say to
                  the girl he has dated since high school. I mean, come on, Jen.
                  Dale can get anyone now. Why would he stay with his girlfriend
                  from high school?</P>
