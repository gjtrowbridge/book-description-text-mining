<h4 align="center">Confidence:<br />
The Path to Freedom</h4>

<p>To be confident a person must walk a path to freedom, arriving
at a place called Emotional Maturity. The people you will
meet there are competent, high achievers. Cheerful and calm,
they are free of anxiety and depression. They will welcome you, for
they are not shy. When annoyed, they will set a good example with
their straightforward honesty. They play the game of life with a Winning
Hand, and you can join them if you make the journey.</p>

<p>The path to Emotional Maturity can free up everyone's inborn,
natural confidence. Like any journey, there is much to gain and some
necessary losses. On this pathway to confidence you will discover new
ways of thinking and acting, and gain the emotional management
skills that are the bedrock of complete confidence.</p>

<p>What you will lose are the immature emotions of childhood and
adolescence. Fears of judgment and correction will be gone. There will
be no more shaming self-criticism, and no helpless self-pity, for confident people are self-reliant and rarely need help. Instead of feeling
guilt about not pleasing other people or resentment about having to please them, you will listen to yourself and do only what you believe
to be right and necessary. And to further lighten the burden of emotional
immaturity, you'll learn to calm and comfort emotions internally,
within the brain, ending dependence on binges and addictions,
the insecurity blankets so many people cling to.</p>

<p>"But Sheenah," you might ask (my clients call me by my first name
and I hope you will, too), "this is some promise you are making. Is it
mere psychobabble?" Good question. Let me answer it. Notice how
you are dissuading rather than encouraging yourself to try. Realize
how your doubts about our confidence project are built on dark predictions
of disappointment and failure. If you see success as unlikely
or even impossible, you undermine your confidence.</p>

<p>Begin now by fighting against any tendency that will undermine
your effort. "This won't work." "I've tried before and failed." "This
book is probably just the same old self-help stuff." "People can't
change." These ideas are self-defeating, and in a way self-pitying and
humiliating. You are not so powerless.</p>

<p>Instead, listen to the opportunity knocking at your door right now.
It's not the sweepstakes guy ready to hand you a check for a million
dollars. This is an opportunity that doesn't require any luck or good
fortune. The Winning Hand knocks on your door. I stand waiting
with my hand outstretched to take yours and walk forward into confidence and success. Confidence is worth more than a million dollars, so
make the effort for yourself.</p>

<p>Hold out your hands and marvel at how much they do for you.
They protect you when you fall. They feed you. They hold the hands
of those you love. They massage, caress, and arouse. They wave
good-bye.</p>

<p>You have a hand in your own troubles, too. So, as you hold your
hands in front of you, look hard at your fingers. They can also poke
and point in criticism and accusation at others and yourself.</p>

<p>The mission of this book is to enable you to take yourself in hand.</p>

<p>I can help you gain the confidence you need to retire your Losing
Hand. Playing with a Winning Hand means you will activate every
talent you have, eagerly take every opportunity you are given, and
calmly solve every problem you face.</p>

<p>It is time to stop blaming yourself and others, to stop pointing a
finger at the flaws you falsely perceive as preventing you from living a
successful life, to stop generating shame and self-pity. It is time to give
up the habits of a loser, and to think and act like a winner.</p>

<p><b>Partners in Confidence</b></p>

<p>Partners starting a business sign a contract. As my future partner,
please read this contract carefully before you sign it.</p>

<p>"But Sheenah," you ask, "why should I trust you? I haven't even
met you." If you want to know more about me before signing the contract,
first read the next section. I hope you will then agree to be my
partner in confidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The Commitment to Confidence Contract</b></p>

<ol>
<li>I will read Complete Confidence from beginning to end.</li>

<li>I will practice all the strategies and behaviors that are required for a confident life, and repeat them over and over again so that I can learn to become confident. (People learn by rehearsal.)</li>

<li>I will be very persistent because it is not intelligence, money, or
good luck that leads to success; it is persistence.</li>

<li>I will have faith that I can learn to be more confident. I will not
listen to my feelings if they make me feel that I will fail.</li>

<li>I will begin to read <i>Complete Confidence</i> today and I will set time aside every day until I finish it -- I will not put off this project.</li>
</ol>

<p>I commit to the aforementioned conditions:</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Your Signature/Date</p>

<p>I, Sheenah Hankin, commit to being your partner. I promise that the methods I describe in my book work when you fulfill your
commitment, which I trust that you will.</p>

<p>Your partner:<br />
Sheenah Hankin</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Meet Sheenah, Your Partner in Confidence</b></p>

<p>Unlike therapists who reveal nothing about themselves, I prefer the
openness of self-disclosure. So, I'll tell you a little about myself. In my
busy practice in New York, I invite every client to ask me personal
questions, for people are usually curious about shrinks. What are their
private lives like? Are they secretly nuts like those depicted in the
movies and on television? Do they have children? How do their children
and marriages turn out? Are they obsessed with sex? Are they
competent and confident? Do they have enough professional and reallife
experience to be helpful?
