<h4>EXCERPT</h4>

<p>1<br /><br />A man begins dying at the moment of his birth. Most <br />people live in denial of Death&#8217;s patient courtship until, late in life and deep in sickness, they become aware of him sitting bedside.<br /><br />Eventually, Mitchell Rafferty would be able to cite the minute that he began to recognize the inevitability of his death: Monday, May 14, 11:43 in the morning&#8211;three weeks short of his twenty-eighth birthday.<br /><br />Until then, he had rarely thought of dying. A born optimist, charmed by nature&#8217;s beauty and amused by humanity, he had no cause or inclination to wonder when and how his mortality would be proven.<br /><br />When the call came, he was on his knees. <br /><br />Thirty flats of red and purple impatiens remained to be planted. The flowers produced no fragrance, but the fertile smell of the soil pleased him.<br /><br />His clients, these particular homeowners, liked saturated colors: red, purple, deep yellow, hot pink. They would not accept white blooms or pastels.<br /><br />Mitch understood them. Raised poor, they had built a <br />successful business by working hard and taking risks. To them, life was intense, and saturated colors reflected the truth of nature&#8217;s vehemence.<br /><br />This apparently ordinary but in fact momentous morning, the California sun was a buttery ball. The sky had a basted sheen.<br /><br />Pleasantly warm, not searing, the day nevertheless left a greasy sweat on Ignatius Barnes. His brow glistened. His chin dripped.<br /><br />At work in the same bed of flowers, ten feet from Mitch, Iggy looked boiled. From May until July, his skin responded to the sun not with melanin but with a fierce blush. For one-sixth of the year, before he finally tanned, he appeared to be perpetually embarrassed.<br /><br />Iggy did not possess an understanding of symmetry and harmony in landscape design, and he couldn&#8217;t be trusted to trim roses properly. He was a hard worker, however, and good if not intellectually bracing company.<br /><br />&#8220;You hear what happened to Ralph Gandhi?&#8221; Iggy asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Who&#8217;s Ralph Gandhi?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Mickey&#8217;s brother.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Mickey Gandhi? I don&#8217;t know him, either.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sure you do,&#8221; Iggy said. &#8220;Mickey, he hangs out sometimes at Rolling Thunder.&#8221;<br /><br />Rolling Thunder was a surfers&#8217; bar. <br /><br />&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been there in years,&#8221; Mitch said.<br /><br />&#8220;Years? Are you serious?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Entirely.&#8221;<br />&#8220;I thought you still dropped in sometimes.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So I&#8217;ve really been missed, huh?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit, nobody&#8217;s named a bar stool after you. What&#8211;did you find someplace better than Rolling Thunder?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Remember coming to my wedding three years ago?&#8221; Mitch asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Sure. You had great seafood tacos, but the band was woofy.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They weren&#8217;t woofy.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Man, they had tambourines.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We were on a budget. At least they didn&#8217;t have an accordion.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Because playing an accordion exceeded their skill level.&#8221; <br /><br />Mitch troweled a cavity in the loose soil. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t have finger bells, either.&#8221;<br /><br />Wiping his brow with one forearm, Iggy complained: &#8220;I must have Eskimo genes. I break a sweat at fifty degrees.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t do bars anymore. I do marriage.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, but can&#8217;t you do marriage and Rolling Thunder?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;d just rather be home than anywhere else.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, boss, that&#8217;s sad,&#8221; said Iggy.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not sad. It&#8217;s the best.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;If you put a lion in a zoo three years, six years, he never forgets what freedom was like.&#8221;<br /><br />Planting purple impatiens, Mitch said, &#8220;How would you know? You ever asked a lion?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to ask one. I am a lion.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re a hopeless boardhead.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And proud of it. I&#8217;m glad you found Holly. She&#8217;s a great lady. But I&#8217;ve got my freedom.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Good for you, Iggy. And what do you do with it?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Do with what?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Your freedom. What do you do with your freedom?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Anything I want.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Like, for example?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Anything. Like, if I want sausage pizza for dinner, I don&#8217;t have to ask anyone what she wants.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Radical.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;If I want to go to Rolling Thunder for a few beers, there&#8217;s nobody to bitch at me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Holly doesn&#8217;t bitch.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I can get beer-slammed every night if I want, and nobody&#8217;s gonna be calling to ask when am I coming home.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch began to whistle &#8220;Born Free.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Some wahine comes on to me,&#8221; Iggy said, &#8220;I&#8217;m free to rock and roll.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re coming on to you all the time&#8211;are they?&#8211;those sexy wahines?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Women are bold these days, boss. They see what they want, they just take it.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch said, &#8220;Iggy, the last time you got laid, John Kerry thought he was going to be president.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s not so long ago.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So what happened to Ralph?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ralph who?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Mickey Gandhi&#8217;s brother.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, yeah. An iguana bit off his nose.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Nasty.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Some fully macking ten-footers were breaking, so Ralph and some guys went night-riding at the Wedge.&#8221;<br /><br />The Wedge was a famous surfing spot at the end of the Balboa Peninsula, in Newport Beach.<br /><br />Iggy said, &#8220;They packed coolers full of submarine sandwiches and beer, and one of them brought Ming.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ming?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s the iguana.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So it was a pet?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ming, he&#8217;d always been sweet before.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;d expect iguanas to be moody.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, they&#8217;re affectionate. What happened was some wanker, not even a surfer, just a wannabe tag-along, slipped Ming a quarter-dose of meth in a piece of salami.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Reptiles on speed,&#8221; Mitch said, &#8220;is a bad idea.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Meth Ming was a whole different animal from clean-and-sober Ming,&#8221; Iggy confirmed.<br /><br />Putting down his trowel, sitting back on the heels of his work shoes, Mitch said, &#8220;So now Ralph Gandhi is noseless?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ming didn&#8217;t eat the nose. He just bit it off and spit it out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Maybe he didn&#8217;t like Indian food.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They had a big cooler full of ice water and beer. They put the nose in the cooler and rushed it to the hospital.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Did they take Ralph, too?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They had to take Ralph. It was his nose.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mitch said, &#8220;we are talking about boardheads.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They said it was kinda blue when they fished it out of the ice water, but a plastic surgeon sewed it back on, and now it&#8217;s not blue anymore.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What happened to Ming?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;He crashed. He was totally amped-out for a day. Now he&#8217;s his old self.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s probably hard to find a clinic that&#8217;ll do iguana rehab.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch got to his feet and retrieved three dozen empty plastic plant pots. He carried them to his extended-bed pickup.<br /><br />The truck stood at the curb, in the shade of an Indian laurel. Although the neighborhood had been built-out only five years earlier, the big tree had already lifted the sidewalk. Eventually the insistent roots would block lawn drains and invade the sewer system. <br /><br />The developer&#8217;s decision to save one hundred dollars by <br />not installing a root barrier would produce tens of thousands <br />in repair work for plumbers, landscapers, and concrete contractors. <br /><br />When Mitch planted an Indian laurel, he always used a root barrier. He didn&#8217;t need to make future work for himself. Green growing Nature would keep him busy.<br /><br />The street lay silent, without traffic. Not the barest breath of a breeze stirred the trees.<br /><br />From a block away, on the farther side of the street, a man and a dog approached. The dog, a retriever, spent less time walking than it did sniffing messages left by others of its kind.<br /><br />The stillness pooled so deep that Mitch almost believed he could hear the panting of the distant canine.<br /><br />Golden: the sun and the dog, the air and the promise of the day, the beautiful houses behind deep lawns.<br /><br />Mitch Rafferty could not afford a home in this neighborhood. He was satisfied just to be able to work here. <br /><br />You could love great art but have no desire to live in a museum.<br /><br />He noticed a damaged sprinkler head where lawn met sidewalk. He got his tools from the truck and knelt on the grass, taking a break from the impatiens.<br /><br />His cell phone rang. He unclipped it from his belt, flipped it open. The time was displayed&#8211;11:43&#8211;but no caller&#8217;s number showed on the screen. He took the call anyway.<br /><br />&#8220;Big Green,&#8221; he said, which was the name he&#8217;d given his <br />two-man business nine years ago, though he no longer remembered why.<br /><br />&#8220;Mitch, I love you,&#8221; Holly said.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, sweetie.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Whatever happens, I love you.&#8221;<br /><br />She cried out in pain. A clatter and crash suggested a struggle.<br /><br />Alarmed, Mitch rose to his feet. &#8220;Holly?&#8221;<br /><br />Some guy said something, some guy who now had the phone. Mitch didn&#8217;t hear the words because he was focused on the background noise. <br /><br />Holly squealed. He&#8217;d never heard such a sound from her, such fear. <br /><br />&#8220;Sonofabitch,&#8221; she said, and was silenced by a sharp crack, as though she&#8217;d been slapped.<br /><br />The stranger on the phone said, &#8220;You hear me, Rafferty?&#8221;<br />&#8220;Holly? Where&#8217;s Holly?&#8221;<br /><br />Now the guy was talking away from the phone, not to Mitch: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid. Stay on the floor.&#8221;<br />Another man spoke in the background, his words unclear. <br /><br />The one with the phone said, &#8220;She gets up, punch her. You want to lose some teeth, honey?&#8221;<br />She was with two men. One of them had hit her. Hit her.<br /><br />Mitch couldn&#8217;t get his mind around the situation. Reality suddenly seemed as slippery as the narrative of a nightmare.<br /><br />A meth-crazed iguana was more real than this.<br /><br />Near the house, Iggy planted impatiens. Sweating, red from the sun, as solid as ever.<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s better, honey. That&#8217;s a good girl.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch couldn&#8217;t draw breath. A great weight pressed on his lungs. He tried to speak but couldn&#8217;t find his voice, didn&#8217;t know what to say. Here in bright sun, he felt casketed, buried alive.<br /><br />&#8220;We have your wife,&#8221; said the guy on the phone.<br /><br />Mitch heard himself ask, &#8220;Why?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why do you think, asshole?&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch didn&#8217;t know why. He didn&#8217;t want to know. He didn&#8217;t want to reason through to an answer because every possible answer would be a horror.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m planting flowers.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you, Rafferty?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s what I do. Plant flowers. Repair sprinklers.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Are you buzzed or something?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m just a gardener.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So we have your wife. You get her back for two million cash.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch knew it wasn&#8217;t a joke. If it were a joke, Holly would have to be in on it, but her sense of humor was not cruel.<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mistake.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You hear what I said? Two million.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Man, you aren&#8217;t listening. I&#8217;m a gardener.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We know.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I have like eleven thousand bucks in the bank.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We know.&#8221;<br /><br />Brimming with fear and confusion, Mitch had no room for anger. Compelled to clarify, perhaps more for himself than for the caller, he said, &#8220;I just run a little two-man operation.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;ve got until midnight Wednesday. Sixty hours. We&#8217;ll be in touch about the details.&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch was sweating. &#8220;This is nuts. Where would I get two million bucks?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;ll find a way.&#8221;<br /><br />The stranger&#8217;s voice was hard, implacable. In a movie, Death might sound like this.<br /><br />&#8220;It isn&#8217;t possible,&#8221; Mitch said.<br /><br />&#8220;You want to hear her scream again?&#8221;<br />&#8220;No. Don&#8217;t.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Do you love her?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Really love her?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;She&#8217;s everything to me.&#8221;<br /><br />How peculiar, that he should be sweating yet feel so cold.<br /><br />&#8220;If she&#8217;s everything to you,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;then you&#8217;ll find a way.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a way.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;If you go to the cops, we&#8217;ll cut her fingers off one by one, and cauterize them as we go. We&#8217;ll cut her tongue out. And her eyes. Then we&#8217;ll leave her alone to die as fast or slow as she wants.&#8221;<br /><br />The stranger spoke without menace, in a matter-of-fact tone, as if he were not making a threat but were instead merely explaining the details of his business model.<br /><br />Mitchell Rafferty had no experience of such men. He might as well have been talking to a visitor from the far end of the galaxy. <br /><br />He could not speak because suddenly it seemed that he might so easily, unwittingly say the wrong thing and ensure Holly&#8217;s death sooner rather than later.<br /><br />The kidnapper said, &#8220;Just so you&#8217;ll know we&#8217;re serious . . .&#8221;<br /><br />After a silence, Mitch asked, &#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;See that guy across the street?&#8221;<br /><br />Mitch turned and saw a single pedestrian, the man walking the slow dog. They had progressed half a block.<br /><br />The sunny day had a porcelain glaze. Rifle fire shattered the stillness, and the dogwalker went down, shot in the head.<br /><br />&#8220;Midnight Wednesday,&#8221; said the man on the phone. &#8220;We&#8217;re damn serious.&#8221;</p>
