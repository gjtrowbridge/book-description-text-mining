<H4 align=center>Chapter One</H4>
                  <P><I>London, 1806</I></P>
                  <P>The coach belonging to the duchess of Magnus pulled up to
                  the tall house on Berkley Square, and an imposter stepped
                  out.</P>
                  <P>The imposter's long, sturdy traveling cloak covered plain,
                  dark, modest traveling clothes. Like the duchess, she was tall
                  and well-rounded, and she spoke with the duchess's
                  aristocratic accent. Also like the duchess, she wore her black
                  hair smoothed back from her face.</P>
                  <P>Yet for the discerning eye, the differences were obvious.
                  The imposter had a sweeter, rounder face, dominated by large
                  blue eyes striking in their serenity. Her voice was husky,
                  warm, rich. Her hands rested calmly at her waist, and she
                  moved with serene grace, not at all with the brisk certainty
                  of the duchess. She was slow to smile, slow to frown, and
                  never laughed with glorious freedom. Indeed, she seemed to
                  weigh each emotion before allowing it egress, as if sometime
                  in the past every drop of impulsiveness had been choked from
                  her. It wasn't that she was morose, but she was observant,
                  composed, and far too quiet.</P>
                  <P>Yes, a knowledgeable person would recognize the differences
                  between the duchess and the imposter. Fortunately for Miss
                  Eleanor Madeline Anne Elizabeth de Lacy, no such person was in
                  London at that moment, with the exception of her groom, her
                  coachmen and footmen, and they were all devoted to her cousin,
                  the real duchess, and to Eleanor, the duchess's companion.
                  They would never betray Eleanor's mission.</P>
                  <P>They would never tell Mr. Remington Knight the truth.</P>
                  <P>Eleanor's heart sank as Mr. Remington Knight's stern-faced
                  butler made the announcement into the large, echoing foyer.
                  "Her Grace, the duchess of Magnus."</P>
                  <P>To hear herself presented in such a formal manner made her
                  want to glance about for her cousin. If only Madeline were
                  here! If only she hadn't turned aside from this mission for a
                  more important task!</P>
                  <P>If only Eleanor hadn't agreed to impersonate her.</P>
                  <P>At the far end of the room, a liveried footman bowed, then
                  disappeared into an open doorway. He was gone only a moment,
                  then returned and inclined his head to the butler.</P>
                  <P>The butler turned to Eleanor and intoned, "The master is
                  busy, but he will receive you soon. In the meantime, ma'am,
                  I'm Bridgeport. May I take your cloak and bonnet?"</P>
                  <P>Although noon had passed, the mists outside subdued the
                  sunlight into a wash of gray. The light of the candles
                  couldn't illuminate the dark corners of Mr. Knight's enormous
                  entry, an entry built to communicate, in the surest way
                  possible, the owner's wealth.</P>
                  <P>Eleanor's nostrils quivered with scorn.</P>
                  <P>Bridgeport jumped a little, as if anticipating her ripping
                  at him as a substitute for his master.</P>
                  <P>Of course Mr. Knight would take this house; he wanted
                  everyone to know he was rolling in riches. He was, after all,
                  nothing more than an upstart American who dreamed of marrying
                  a title.</P>
                  <P>Yet the entry was decorated with velvet draperies of
                  evergreen and gold, and with a profusion of cut glass and
                  beveled mirrors in marvelous good taste. Eleanor comforted
                  herself with the thought that Mr. Knight had bought it in this
                  condition and was even now planning to gut it and install gilt
                  in the Chinese fashion, a style fully as vulgar as --
                  Eleanor's mouth quirked with humor -- as vulgar as was adored
                  by the Prince of Wales himself.</P>
                  <P>Bridgeport relaxed and returned to his stolid demeanor.</P>
                  <P>He watched her much too closely. Because he thought she was
                  the duchess? Or because his master had so instructed him?</P>
                  <P>She removed her bonnet, stripped off her gloves, placed
                  them in the dark bonnet, and handed them to the butler without
                  a trace of outer trepidation. After all, what was the point of
                  showing trepidation? It would merely be another proof that,
                  although Eleanor had traveled across war-torn Europe as the
                  duchess's companion, she hadn't acquired the verve and
                  confidence that characterized Madeline's every move. This
                  wasn't from lack of trials; the two women had faced trials
                  aplenty. It was because -- Eleanor sighed as she allowed the
                  butler to take her cloak -- Eleanor was born timid. She never
                  remembered a time when her father's shouting hadn't paralyzed
                  her with fright, or when her stepmother's narrow-eyed glare
                  hadn't had the power to turn her into a bowl of quivering
                  blancmange. Which is why Eleanor cultivated a serene facade --
                  she might be a coward, but she saw no reason to announce the
                  fact.</P>
                  <P>"If you would follow me, Your Grace, to the large drawing
                  room, I will order refreshments," Bridgeport said. "You must
                  be tired after your long journey."</P>
                  <P>"Not so long." Eleanor followed him through the tall door
                  off to the left. "I stayed at the Red Robin Inn last night and
                  spent only four hours on the road this morning."</P>
                  <P>The butler's impassivity slipped, and for a moment an
                  expression of horror crossed his countenance. "Your Grace, if
                  I might make a suggestion. When dealing with Mr. Knight, it's
                  best not to tell him that you failed to obey his instructions
                  with all speed."</P>
                  <P>Turning from her contemplation of the elegantly appointed
                  room, she raised her eyebrows in haughty imitation of her
                  cousin and gazed at the butler in a frigid silence.</P>
                  <P>It must have worked, for Bridgeport bowed. "Your pardon,
                  Your Grace. I'll send for tea."</P>
                  <P>"Thank you," Eleanor said with composure. "And more
                  substantial refreshments, also." For she suspected Mr. Knight
                  intended to keep her waiting, and it had been five hours since
                  breakfast.</P>
                  <P>Bridgeport left Eleanor to scrutinize her grandiose
                  prison.</P>
                  <P>Tall windows let in the timid sunlight, and the candles
                  washed the walls with a pleasant golden glow. Books lined one
                  wall, reaching all the way to the twelve-foot ceiling ...</P>
