              <p align="center"><b>From Chapter 2: Centuries of Memories</b>
<p>We were members of the country club and of the church -- just like other normal
  working families. Abi and Nathan were members of the swim team and won ribbons
  at all of the meets, where they would chug pink Jell-O sugar before they dove
  into the frosty waters. I was jealous. I wanted to do everything my older siblings
  did. They dove off the high dive at the pool and had friends that would give
  them the equivalent of high fives when they won. I really don't know if people
  gave high fives back then. It's a trend now that's so silly I can't believe
  we all do it, but we do. Whenever someone does something good it's &quot;High
  five!&quot; And we smack hands. Hilarious.
<p>(Human behavior is so intriguing. I find myself giving thumbs-up signs all
  the time. I know I look like an absolute dork, but I do it anyway. I want to
  get a trend going where we're giving each other thumbs-up signs for just being
  alive and walking down the street. Sometimes life is so hard and we judge people
  rather than realizing that it's an accomplishment to simply get up in the morning.
  So . . .<i> thumbs-up!</i> You're awake.)
<p>I was so anxious to learn what Abi and Nate were doing that one day I climbed
  to the top of the high dive. Once there, I realized that I was scared out of
  my mind. For some reason, my father was there, which was a rare occasion. He
  climbed up behind me and pushed me off -- no warning. This was the subtlety
  of my father. Maybe he was right. After that I don't remember being scared of
  anything, at least not anything that I would admit publicly or in front of him.
  Someone at the club must have taken notice because soon after that I was asked
  to be a replacement on the swim team, and I was happily winning ribbons too.
  But the swim team didn't last.
<p>I don't remember what happened first or last in the series of events that follow.
  The truth is I don't remember a whole lot about this time in my life or the
  years to come. My memories have come back sketchy to say the least -- somehow
  our bodies and minds protect us from the whole truth -- but I'll tell you what
  I know.
<p>I remember getting a weird feeling when we were at the country club restaurant
  one night. We rarely went out to dinner, but we were there and Dad was talking
  to the maï¿½tre d'. Talking turned to arguing and the next thing I knew, Dad was
  pocketing the wonderful-tasting butter mints that were sitting on the counter
  near the exit. I don't mean a couple of mints either -- I'm talking the entire
  dish of mints. And then we were gone. Not only from the restaurant, but from
  the club altogether. We never swam in the pool or ate in the restaurant again.
<p>I was in the middle of second grade by this point and Dad was disappearing
  rapidly from our lives. He was supposedly going to New York on business. His
  trips were getting more and more frequent the longer we stayed in the house.
  It was very curious to me, seeing that the only thing I had ever known my father
  to do was go out to the garage and look at the fabric samples he had collected.
  Yes, fabric samples. He had tons of them piled high in the garage out back.
  You know those books that you can flip through when you're trying to decide
  how to redecorate? Well, those books were littered by the hundreds all over
  the floor along with some carpet samples. Certainly this was strange for a man
  who didn't have a job, but his excuse was that he wanted to go into interior
  design and he knew some women who were helping him do just that. Well, Mom didn't
  say much to Dad about anything, but whenever he brought up those women or the
  whole interior decorating thing, you could tell she was upset. If I didn't know
  Christians better, I might have thought she hated those women.
<p>Dad had dropped out of medical school when they were in college and Mom was
  pregnant with Susan, and although it wasn't mentioned often, you could hear
  her disappointment hidden in sentences like &quot;Donald!&quot; (Oh, yeah, that
  was his name.) &quot;If you had only stayed in school and become a doctor we
  would have food to put on the table! How long do you think I can feed these
  children on five dollars a week!?&quot;
<p>Mom rarely spoke to my father that way. He would purse his lips like a prissy
  old woman with no sugar in her tea and stomp away with a condescending &quot;Good
  Christian women respect their husbands! Don't ever say that to me again, Naaannncyyyy!!!&quot;
<p>Nancy was her name, and when he said it like that she shut up. I guess five
  dollars a week was what he got for playing piano on Sundays at our new church.
  That was the only job he seemed to keep. That and choir directing. He loved
  choir directing. He would sway his arms in the air like a fairy and everyone
  loved it, including my mother. He was good at music. Music and fabric samples.
  So when Dad told Mom that he was going to New York on business and the business
  was gas and oil, you can imagine her surprise.
<p><i>Gas and oil,</i> that's what I said. Now how on earth could a choir director
  from Aurora, Ohio, who doesn't have any skills other than knowing what shade
  of pink complements what shade of black and which notes are played in the key
  of G find himself in the business of selling gas and oil? No one could figure.
  Especially not my mother. But this was a perfect time to exercise the number-one
  rule. <i>No questions asked</i> was also a rule my mother had to abide by, and
  it was followed quickly by her number-two rule: <i>Good Christian women believe
  anything that their husbands tell them no matter how absurd it may sound.</i>
  This worked out well for my father. God knows it was absurd! My mother was stuck
  with a houseful of kids on a few dollars a week while Dad went off to New York
  City on whose tab no one knew, to develop a business in gas and oil, which he
  knew nothing about and had never mentioned before in his life. We kids, of course,
  were kept in the dark about all of it. We dutifully did everything we were told
  and didn't question when Dad was out of town on business for weeks at a time,
  because we didn't want to get beaten with a spoon.
<p>We also didn't question anything when we stepped outside to be driven to school
  one day and the car was gone. Just gone. No sign of it anywhere and nothing
  to be said about it. Dad was out of town, so we knew he hadn't run off with
  it, but it was all excused with Mom's cheery &quot;I'm sure it's just some sort
  of mix-up.&quot;
<p>Like good children we nodded our heads in agreement. &quot;Sure it is, Mom.
  Just a little mixer-upper. No worries.&quot;
<p>We trudged back inside and made bread. Homemade bread always made everyone
  feel better, and it was food that was cheap. We sprinkled cinnamon and sugar
  on the buttered stuff and we had sandwiches for a whole week. Who knows how
  we got along without a car, that part escapes me.
<p>When Dad didn't show up for three weeks, claiming that he was snowed in and
  the airports wouldn't let any planes out, I think my mother started to get suspicious.
  The weeks that he had been home the previous months, he would fly in on a Saturday
  night, tell the kids that they were singing in church the next morning for the
  congregation's entertainment, and fly out on Sunday night. He couldn't rehearse
  the choir he used to love so much, spending as little time at home as he did,
  so we had become the choir. Dad had taught us to sing on key and we looked cute
  up on stage in our homemade clothes, so. . .why not? We sang the same songs
  over and over, our version of a hymn in three-part (our fourth was off to college
  by now) harmony. And like a good Christian congregation, no one said a word.
  They, like good wives and good children, kept their mouths shut and looked like
  they were enjoying each phrase we sang as if it were the first time they had
  heard it. Like the story of Jesus turning water into wine, Christians can listen
  to anything over and over again and seem to stay interested.
<p>When I mistakenly asked about this phenomenon one Sunday after church, I was
  given the lovely speech my mother so often gave as I pulled up my dress to expose
  my young rump: &quot;You know I don't want to be doing this, honey.&quot; Then
  she smacked me raw and sent me upstairs, hoping I would once and for all learn
  the number-one rule.
<p>&quot;What will it take to get the question mark out of that child's brain?&quot;
  she must have thought -- never questioning that she too was questioning, and
  even though she didn't want me to see it, I saw it in her eyes.
