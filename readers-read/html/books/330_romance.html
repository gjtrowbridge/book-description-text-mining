<p>Christmas Past<br />
December 1843</p>

<p><em>Affectionately Yours, Lizzie.</em></p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth Effington stared at the
words she'd just written and grimaced. No. <em>Affectionately</em>
was entirely too personal, and <em>Lizzie</em>
too informal. He'd never called her Lizzie and she
doubted he'd start now. Indeed, with one signifi-
cant exception, he'd never been anything other
than completely proper with her. It was most annoying.
She crossed out the line just as she had
the previous three attempts.</p>

<p>"That was truly wonderful." Behind her, her
younger sister, Juliana, sighed with heartfelt satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I knew you would like it," Lizzie said absently
and stared at the sheet of white velum lying on the
desk in front of her in the sitting room she shared
with Jules.</p>

<p>"It was so ... so ..." Jules thought for a moment.
"Wonderful."</p>

<p>"Quite," Lizzie murmured and wrote <em>With
Sincere Best Wishes, Lady Elizabeth Effington</em>.</p>

<p>"No, more than wonderful. I daresay it's the
best story about Christmas -- no -- the best story
about anything I have ever read."</p>

<p>That wasn't right either. <em>With Sincere Best
Wishes</em> had an obligatory ring, as if one were
writing to an elderly relative one didn't particularly
like but was required to be pleasant to
nonetheless. Besides, while Lizzie might be too
personal, <em>Lady Elizabeth Effington</em> was far and
away too formal for her purposes. She slashed a
pen stroke through the bothersome phrase.</p>

<p>"In point of fact," Jules continued in a tone
that sounded far more like a literary critic than a
mere girl of sixteen years, "I think it's quite the
best story Mr. Dickens has written. Of those
I've read, of course, but I do think I've read most
of his stories as he is possibly my favorite author.
It's not as amusing as <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em>
but a far better ending to my mind than <em>The Old
Curiosity Shop</em>, although I do so love stories
about girls having adventures." Jules paused.
"Even if Little Nell's were rather dreadful."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, dying at the end of one's story does
tend to make one's adventures a bit less than
cheery," Lizzie said under her breath.</p>

<p><em>With eternal friendship, Elizabeth.</em></p>

<p>"I dislike books that don't end well. Mother's
books always end well. This one does too, in a
fashion, although it is something of a pity Scrooge
did not discover the error of his ways until he was old. He would have had a rather wonderful life if
he had married Belle. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Um hmm."</p>

<p><em>Friendship</em> was good. Not the least bit improper.
And Elizabeth had the right tone. Perhaps
... Lizzie sighed and crossed out her latest
effort. Why on earth was this so blasted diffi-
cult? All she was trying to do was come up with
an appropriate inscription for a book to give as a
gift. Still, her words were as important as the
book itself. Even more so.</p>

<p>"I think my very favorite part though," Jules
said slowly, "was at the end when Tiny Tim
sprouted wings and flew off with Fezziwig and
the Ghost of Christmas Past. Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course. I ..." Lizzie jerked her head
up, swiveled in her chair, and stared at her sister.
"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I suspected as much." Jules narrowed her
eyes suspiciously. "You weren't listening to a
word I said, were you?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly was. You said ... " Lizzie
searched her mind. She did so hate to admit that
her sister was right, at least in part. "You said you
liked <em>A Christmas Carol</em> better than any of Mr.
Dickens's other works."</p>

<p>Jules snorted in a most unladylike manner.
"That was the very least of what I said." She sat
upright on the chaise and craned her neck to see
around her sister. "Whatever are you doing, anyway?"</p>

<p>Lizzie shifted to shield the paper on the desk
and adopted a casual tone. "Nothing of importance
really. Just trying to find the right words."</p>

<p>Jules raised a brow. "For what?"</p>

<p>"For none of your concern, that's what,"
Lizzie said firmly.</p>

<p>"Is it something for Charles?" Jules fluttered
her lashes in an exaggerated manner.</p>

<p>Lizzie laughed. "No, it's not. And even if it
was, I wouldn't tell you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Indignation sounded in the
younger girl's voice. "I'd tell you what Iwas giving
the gentleman who was about to ask for my hand
in marriage."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Lizzie said quickly. "Charles is
not about to ask for my hand."</p>

<p>Jules smirked. "Would you care to wager on
that?"</p>

<p>Lizzie stared at her sister, unease settling in the
pit of her stomach. "Do you know something I
should know?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps." Jules settled back on the chaise and
smiled at her sister in that irritating way younger
girls refine for the express purpose of torturing
their older sisters. "I might know that Charles
spoke to Father privately this morning. And I
might further know, when Charles came out of
Father's library, he had a look of relief and excitement
on his face."</p>

<p>Lizzie waved off her sister's comments. "That
could mean anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Lizzie. You can't be the least
bit surprised by this." Jules studied her sister curiously.
"For as long as I can remember, everyone
in both our families has expected a match between
you. I rather thought you expected to
marry him as well."</p>

<p>"Charles is a good man and an excellent
match, and any woman would be honored to be
his wife. Indeed, it seems to me there are any
number of young women wishing to do just
that." Lizzie smiled in a noncommittal manner
and hoped her comments would satisfy her sister.</p>

<p>"I know I would. Charles is wonderful." Jules
heaved a heartfelt sigh. "He's so handsome, with
the brightest blue eyes and the merriest smile and
the most charming manner. Indeed, I fear I have a
penchant for men with blond, wavy hair. One is
hard-pressed to keep from running one's fingers
through it."
