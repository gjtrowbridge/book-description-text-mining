<STRONG>Inkheart</STRONG><BR>by Cornelia Funke
<BR>
<P><B>Excerpt:</B><BR>"You were just three years old, Meggie,"
Mo began. "I remember how we celebrated your birthday. We gave
you a picture book � you know, the one about the sea serpent
with a toothache winding itself around the lighthouse. . ."
<BR><BR>
Meggie nodded. It was still in her book box � Mo had
twice given it a new dress. "We?" she asked.<BR><BR>"Your
mother and I . . ." Mo picked some straw off his pants. "I
could never pass by a bookshop. The house where we lived was
very small � we called it our shoebox, our mouse-hole, we had
all sorts of names for it � and that very day I'd bought yet
another crate full of books from a second-hand bookseller.
Elinor would have liked some of them," he added, glancing at
her and smiling. "Capricorn's book was there too."<BR><BR>"You
mean it belonged to him?" Meggie looked at Mo in surprise, but
he shook his head.<BR><BR>"No, but . . .well, let's take it
all in order. Your mother sighed when she saw all those new
books and asked where we were going to put them, but then of
course she helped me to unpack the crate. I always used to
read aloud to her in the evenings -"<BR><BR>"You? You read
aloud?"</P>
<P>"Yes, every evening. Your mother enjoyed it. That evening
she chose <I>Inkheart</I>. She always did like tales of
adventure � stories full of brightness and darkness. She could
tell you the names of all King Arthur's knights, and she knew
everything about Beowulf and Grendel, the ancient gods and the
not-quite-so-ancient heroes. She liked pirate stories, too,
but most of all she loved books that had at least a knight or
a dragon or a fairy in them. She was always on the dragon's
side, by the way. There didn't seem to be any of them in
<I>Inkheart</I>, but there was any amount of brightness and
                  darkness, fairies and goblins. Your mother liked goblins as
                  well: hobgoblins, bugaboos, the Fenoderee, the <I>folletti</I>
                  with their butterfly wings, she knew them all. So we gave you
                  a pile of picture books, sat down on the rug beside you, and I
                  began to read."</P>
                  <P>Meggie leaned her head against Mo's shoulder and stared at
                  the empty wall. She saw herself against its dirty white
                  background as she had looked in old photos: small, with plump
                  legs, very fair hair (it had darkened a little since then),
                  her little fingers turning the pages of big picture books.</P>
                  <P>"We enjoyed the story," her father went on, "It was
                  exciting, well written, and full of all sorts of amazing
                  creatures. Your mother loved a book to lead her into an
                  unknown land, and the world in to which Inkheart led her was
                  exactly what she liked. Sometimes the story took a very dark
                  turn, and whenever the suspense got too much, your mother put
                  a finger to her lips, and I read more quietly, although we
                  were sure you were too busy with your own books to listen to a
                  sinister story that you wouldn't have understood anyway. I
                  remember it as if it were yesterday. Night had fallen long
                  ago; it was autumn, with drafts coming in through the windows.
                  We had lit a fire � there was no central heating in our
                  shoebox of a house, but it had a stove in every room � and I
                  began reading the seventh chapter. That's when it happened
                  �"</P>
<P>Mo stopped. He stared ahead of him as if lost in his own
thoughts.</P>
<P>"What?" whispered Meggie. "What happened, Mo?"</P>
