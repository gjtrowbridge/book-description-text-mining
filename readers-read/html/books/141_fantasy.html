	 <p>Jude had a private collection.
</p>
<p>
He had framed sketches of the Seven Dwarfs on the wall of his studio, in between his
platinum records. John Wayne Gacy had drawn them while he was in jail and sent them
to him. Gacy liked golden-age Disney almost as much as he liked molesting little kids;
almost as much as he liked Jude's albums.
</p>
<p>
Jude had the skull of a peasant who had been trepanned in the sixteenth century, to let the
demons out. He kept a collection of pens jammed into the hole in the center of the
cranium.
</p>
<p>
He had a three-hundred-year-old confession, signed by a witch. "I did spake with a black
dogge who sayd hee wouldst poison cows, drive horses mad and sicken children for me if
I wouldst let him have my soule, and I sayd aye, and after did give him sucke at my
breast." She was burned to death.
</p>
<p>
He had a stiff and worn noose that had been used to hang a man in England at the turn of
the century, Aleister Crowley's childhood chessboard, and a snuff film. Of all the items
in Jude's collection, this last was the thing he felt most uncomfortable about possessing.
It had come to him by way of a police officer, a man who had worked security at some
shows in L.A. The cop had said the video was diseased. He said it with some enthusiasm.
Jude had watched it and felt that he was right. It was diseased. It had also, in an indirect
way, helped hasten the end of Jude's marriage. Still he held onto it.

</p>
<p>
Many of the objects in his private collection of the grotesque and the bizarre were gifts
sent to him by his fans. It was rare for him to actually buy something for the collection
himself. But when Danny Wooten, his personal assistant, told him there was a ghost for
sale on the Internet, and asked did he want to buy it, Jude didn't even need to think. It
was like going out to eat, hearing the special, and deciding you wanted it without even
looking at the menu. Some impulses required no consideration.
</p>
<p>
Danny's office occupied a relatively new addition, extending from the northeastern end
of Jude's rambling, 110-year-old farmhouse. With its climate control, OfficeMax
furniture, and coffee-and-cream industrial carpet, the office was coolly impersonal,
nothing at all like the rest of the house. It might have been a dentist's waiting room, if not
for the concert posters in stainless-steel frames. One of them showed a jar crammed with
staring eyeballs, bloody knots of nerves dangling from the backs of them. That was for
the All Eyes On You tour.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had the addition been built than Jude had come to regret it. He had not wanted
to drive forty minutes from Piecliff to a rented office in Poughkeepsie to see to his
business, but that would've probably been preferable to having Danny Wooten right here
at the house. Here Danny and Danny's work were too close. When Jude was in the
kitchen, he could hear the phones ringing in there, both of the office lines going off at
once sometimes, and the sound was maddening to him. He had not recorded an album in
years, had hardly worked since Jerome and Dizzy had died (and the band with them), but
still the phones rang and rang. He felt crowded by the steady parade of petitioners for his
time, and by the never-ending accumulation of legal and professional demands,
agreements and contracts, promotions and appearances, the work of Judas Coyne
Incorporated, which was never done, always ongoing. When he was home, he wanted to
be himself, not a trademark.
</p>
<p>
For the most part Danny stayed out of the rest of the house. Whatever his flaws, he was
protective of Jude's private space. But Danny considered him fair game if Jude strayed
into the office - something Jude did, without much pleasure, four or five times a day.
Passing through the office was the fastest way to the barn and the dogs. He could've
avoided Danny by going out through the front door and walking all the way around the
house, but he refused to sneak around his own home just to avoid Danny Wooten.
</p>
<p>
Besides, it didn't seem possible Danny could always have something to bother him with.
But he always did. And if he didn't have anything that demanded immediate attention, he
wanted to talk. Danny was from Southern California originally, and there was no end to
his talk. He would boast to total strangers about the benefits of wheatgrass, which
included making your bowel movements as fragrant as a freshly mowed lawn. He was
thirty years old but could talk skateboarding and PlayStation with the pizza-delivery kid
like he was fourteen. Danny would get confessional with air-conditioner repairmen, tell
them how his sister had OD'd on heroin in her teens and how as a young man he had
been the one to find his mother's body after she killed herself. He was impossible to
embarrass. He didn't know the meaning of shy.
</p>
<p>

Jude was coming back inside from feeding Angus and Bon and was halfway across
Danny's field of fire - just beginning to think he might make it through the office
unscathed - when Danny said, "Hey, Chief, check this out." Danny opened almost every
demand for attention with just this line, a statement Jude had learned to dread and resent,
a prelude to half an hour of wasted time, forms to fill out, faxes to look at. Then Danny
told him someone was selling a ghost, and Jude forgot all about begrudging him. He
walked around the desk so he could look over Danny's shoulder at his computer screen.
</p>
<p>
Danny had discovered the ghost at an online auction site, not eBay but one of the
wannabes. Jude moved his gaze over the item description while Danny read aloud. Danny
would've cut his food for him if Jude gave him the chance. He had a streak of
subservience that Jude found, frankly, revolting in a man.
</p>
<p>
"'Buy my stepfather's ghost,'" Danny read. "'Six weeks ago my elderly stepfather died,
very suddenly. He was staying with us at the time. He had no home of his own and
traveled from relative to relative, visiting for a month or two before moving on. Everyone
was shocked by his passing, especially my daughter, who was very close to him. No one
would've thought. He was active to the end of his life. Never sat in front of the TV.
Drank a glass of orange juice every day. Had all his own teeth.'"
