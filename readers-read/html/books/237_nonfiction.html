<P>Hormones are powerful agents of change in our body. They cause
direct changes in our bodily functions and facilitate our body's reactions
to environmental changes. All of us-men, women, adults,
and adolescents-experience constant hormone fluctuations. How
we look and feel is the direct result of our hormone balance.</P>

<P>When our hormones are in balance, meaning all our hormones
are working together well, the results are amazing. Our skin looks
radiant and fresh, our minds work smoothly, we remember things,
we focus well, our weight and moods are stable, our sex drive soars.
We are young and healthy.</P>

<P>When our hormones are out of balance, problems can develop.
We have difficulty focusing, we get tired and stay tired, we can't
catch up on sleep. We become insomniacs, lose interest in sex, get
bloated, and gain weight. We develop aches and pains in our joints;
our skin gets wrinkled and dry; we get heart disease, digestive problems,
arthritis, osteoporosis. We age.</P>

<P>The aging process is the result of years of wear and tear on our
body. It mirrors the state of our hormone balance, our genetics, and
the type of life we lead.</P>

<P>Understanding how our hormone balance affects everything we
do in our lives is key to maintaining health and preventing aging
from robbing us of vitality.</P>

<P>The need to understand and make the connection between hormone balance and lifestyle, diet, exercise, stress, sleep, and every
part of our lives prompted me to develop the 30-Day Plan.</P>

<P>The goal of the program is to help keep you healthy and youthful
for as long as possible. To take you there, we must first gain insight
into the connection between health (hormones in balance) and
physical and mental deterioration (hormones out of balance). Once
this insight is achieved, the 30-Day Plan helps integrate natural
hormones, supplements, diet, exercise, and lifestyle into your whole
life and effectively accomplish the dream of staying well and delaying
the destructive effects of aging on the body and mind.</P>

<P>This book contains all the simple tools and information you
need to accomplish the anti-aging goal and to understand the messages
that your own body sends you. In addition to the diet, exercise,
and lifestyle portions, I will reinforce the balancing program
with simple and easily available combinations of natural hormones
and supplements.</P>

<P>The natural hormones I endorse and advise you to use are approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
have been on the market for twenty years with long track records
of safety along with extensive clinical experience in the United
States, Canada, and Europe.</P>

<P>The supplements and vitamins I recommend are backed up by
reliable and respected scientific research and substantial clinical
data that support their safety and efficacy. They are accepted and in
use by both conventional medicine and alternative therapies.</P>

<P>But until now, these products have not been combined in the
context of a comprehensive program. My 30-Day Plan is the result
of more than twenty-five years of experience as a doctor helping
solve all types of hormone problems from which my patients have
been suffering. Up to now, the information contained in this book
was only available to the limited number of people who could be
my patients. Now you and your physician can share the 30-Day
Plan and help achieve perfect hormonal balance for your body and
mind.</P>

<P>The 30-Day Plan will help you integrate your diet, exercise, and
lifestyle into a successful hormone-balancing, anti-aging package
that uses common sense and proven medical knowledge.</P>

<P><B>UNDERSTANDING HORMONES</B></P>
<P>Before we get started, we need to understand what hormones are,
and that they are all involved in achieving the balance we need to
feel healthy.</P>

<P>Hormones are products of living cells that circulate in our bodily
fluids and produce specific effects on the activity of other cells
far removed from the organs where the hormones are made. They
stimulate or inhibit the actions of cells everywhere in the body. No
organ is left untouched by the actions of hormones.</P>

<P>There are hundreds of hormones in our bodies, and they have innumerable
jobs. They regulate all bodily functions and interact
with each other at all times. No hormone acts on its own. The action
of one hormone affects the action of many others and the results
vary, depending on infinite internal and external factors.</P>

<P>Hormones are produced through chemical processes by glands
and organs in specialized cells. They are made from fatty acids, various
combinations of protein components called amino acids, and
certain sugar molecules. Most hormones are, in fact, derived from a
familiar substance, cholesterol. This is one reason cholesterol
should not be dismissed as no more than the culprit behind fatty
deposits in our arteries that cause heart disease or stroke. Without
cholesterol, our body cannot make hormones-and that's an even
graver danger.</P>

<P>Here's a partial list of the better-known and -researched hormones.
This list will give you an idea of their names and how their
presence is ubiquitous:</P>

<P>&#149;  Insulin.</P>
<P>&#149;  Growth hormone.</P>
<P>&#149;  Thyroid hormones (triiodothyonine [T 3 ] and thyroxine [T 4 ]).</P>
<P>&#149;  Parathyroid hormone (parathormone).</P>
<P>&#149;  Calcitonin.</P>
<P>&#149;  Estrogen.</P>
<P>&#149;  Progesterone.</P>
<P>&#149;  Testosterone.</P>
<P>&#149;  Stomach hormones (gastrin, pepsin, trypsin, secretin, and others).</P>
<P>&#149;  Adrenal hormones (cortisol, aldosterone).</P>
<P>&#149;  Kidney hormones (renin).</P>
<P>&#149;  Lung hormones (angiotensin).</P>
<P>&#149;  Brain hormones (serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, luteinizing
hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, adrenaline,
endorphins, norepinephrine).</P>


<P>Looking at this list, you probably recognize some familiar names.
Some of these, like adrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine, are often
called neurotransmitters. They're still hormones, only they're categorized
under a specific grouping of hormones that enhance or
delay transmission of messages in the nervous system, and in the
brain in particular. Another group, estrogen, progesterone, and
testosterone, are the sex hormones. Both men and women have all
three of them, but they vary in concentration according to your
gender.</P>

<P>Some of these hormones are "good" hormones, while others are
not. The good hormones help improve well-being and memory,
maintain sugar balance, and stimulate positive reactions in your
body. The "bad" hormones, when they are out of balance, can be
destructive and increase wear and tear on your mind and your internal
organs.</P>

<P>Examples of good hormones are: serotonin, progesterone, testosterone,
glucagon, aldosterone, dopamine, and growth hormone.</P>

<P>Examples of bad hormones are: cortisol, insulin, and sometimes
estrogen.</P>

<P>What's important to remember is that there is no such thing as
an independent hormone action. Every action affects everything
else going on. Every hormone interacts with others. For us to feel
good and stay healthy, every hormone has to work in balance and
synchrony. When we look at a list of effects of individual hormones,
we are looking at only a small part of the picture.</P>

<P><B>HORMONES IN BALANCE</B></P>
<P>If hormones can be said to have a goal in life, it is to maintain what
is called homeostasis, which means that they are constantly working
to keep us in a state of equilibrium. They strive to maintain balance
inside the body regardless of outside environmental
conditions. In order to maintain this balance, they react to everything
we do. And I mean everything-like eating, sleeping, reading,
running, breathing, hugging, having sex, daydreaming, sitting,
standing, even thinking.</P>

<P>Remember: Many hormones are working at the same time. This
is why no one hormone-or no one anything (vitamin, food, supplement,
medication)-will balance us, keep us young, or protect
us from our own individual ways of destroying our bodies.
And this is why your goal in life should be the same as your hormones'-
to achieve homeostasis, through which you can stay
healthy and enjoy life.</P>

<P><B>HORMONES OUT OF WHACK</B></P>
<P>In an ideal world, we'd all be in homeostasis all the time. But even
in the best of times, we don't live in an ideal world. We live busy
lives, sad lives, happy lives, working lives, playing lives-all at the
same time. Our hormones are constantly adapting to the changes
we experience throughout every single day.</P>

<P>Remember: Hormone levels change whenever we change. Regardless
of age, as long as we are alive, our hormone levels are
changing continuously. When our lives take a new direction,
when a stress appears or disappears, our hormone balance
changes. If we are lucky enough to have a well-balanced life and
are aware of these changes, we can preempt or minimize the problems.
But even if we're able to rapidly rebalance, we never totally
prevent the most common reaction, hormones out of whack.</P>

<P>Lucy was fifty-eight when I first saw her. She had been a physical
education teacher. Diet, exercise, and great personal care
were part of her life. Two years earlier, she and her husband won
the lottery. They didn't have children or family ties in New York
where they lived and decided to retire to Florida. With no worries
about work or money, they had only sunny days to look forward
to-until the unexpected happened.</P>

<P>Lucy had sailed through menopause at forty-five with almost
no symptoms. But now she suddenly started having severe hot
flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and mood swings. Suffering with
almost incapacitating symptoms, Lucy was convinced she had
cancer. She saw three doctors: an internist, an endocrinologist,
and a gynecologist. Diagnoses of Lyme disease, arthritis, diabetes,
thyroid problems, and cancer were considered but discarded.
Finally one of the physicians told Lucy that her
problems were probably hormone related, but there was nothing
that could be done.</P>

<P>The physician was right about the cause of her symptoms-
her problems were an outgrowth of hormone imbalance. But he
was wrong when he said there was no solution. When Lucy
came to me, I treated her with a combination of natural hormones:
estradiol and micronized progesterone in cream form.
But treating the symptoms is not always enough. I knew it was
essential to find out what had triggered Lucy's sudden hormone
imbalance.</P>

<P>I asked Lucy to start a journal. It turned out
that for her (as for many other people), retirement was more
stressful than her busy life had been. She missed the city life.
The stress of the move, and the change of climate and emotional
environment, had pushed her delicate hormone balance
over the edge. Her hormones were going crazy trying to adjust to
so many changes at once.</P>

<P>Within three months, following my program of natural
hormones, supplementation, and journaling, Lucy gained a
better understanding of her new life and began to feel herself
again.</P>

<P>Hormones out of whack can be caused by the smallest of changes
in your internal and/or external environments. Never underestimate
or overlook any part of your life when doing the detective
work of finding what caused your hormones to lose their balance.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, it's all too easy to throw your own hormones out
of whack. I know; I've done it myself. I have personally been using
natural/bioidentical hormones, the supplement regimen, and the
30-Day Plan for more than five years. Occasionally, however, I behave
like every other human being and lose my balance. A perfect
example: I had been doing well for months. My hormones were in
perfect synchrony. My eating habits were impeccable, and my life
was running smoothly without too much stress. A perfect time to
throw off my hormone balance-and it all started with a cup of
coffee.</P>

<P>I love coffee. Unfortunately, coffee doesn't like me, so I generally
avoid it. But one day, I found myself with a yen for coffee. I decided
to have just one espresso. I did. No symptoms. I advanced to a double.
Still no problem. Within three days, I was drinking two cups of
coffee a day. I started getting a little heartburn. I took some Zantac.
The heartburn was gone and I continued my coffees. I knew the
coffee was causing the heartburn, but I chose to ignore that fact.</P>

<P>Within one week, I started waking up in the middle of the night
with night sweats. During the day I experienced an occasional hot
flash. Within another few days, I found myself exhausted all the
time. Soon after, I started craving sweets, and my commitment to
exercise suddenly disappeared. Faced with all these changes, I
thought I might be taking too high a dose of natural hormones, so
I decreased my dose. My symptoms worsened. Finally, after two
weeks of feeling crummy, I decided to face reality. My hormones
were out of whack and everything I did added to the problem.
I stopped the coffee, went back on my usual dosage of natural
hormones, cleaned up my eating act, and got back on track. It took
two weeks to get back to normal. The lesson learned? I'm fifty-two,
my body cannot tolerate coffee, and I have to listen to it if I want
to feel good. The lesson relearned? The balance of hormones is precarious,
and one small thing can set off a domino effect, pushing
everything out of control.</P>

<P>The 30-Day Plan will help prevent the dominoes from falling
and robbing you of precious wellness time. By following the advice
in these pages, you will be able to quickly identify the culprits that
disturb your hormone balance. By the time you're finished with this
book, your hormones will no longer be a mystery, and understanding
how to help maintain their balance will be second nature.</P>

<P><B>MENARCHE TO MENOPAUSE-WHO SUFFERS FROM HORMONE IMBALANCE?</B></P>

<P>While preparing to write The Hormone Solution, I reviewed the
records of five hundred patients (covering the years 1997 through
2001) in my own practice, looking at the age distribution for
women with diagnoses related to hormone imbalances. The demographics
revealed an almost even distribution between menopausal
women and women ranging in age from sixteen to forty-five.</P>

<P>The results seemed unusual, but I was sure I wasn't misdiagnosing
these women. They all had thorough and complete medical
evaluations and blood tests from other doctors before they came to
me. Their extensive and expensive workups confused and scared
them, but offered them no solutions. But when I put them on my
30-Day Plan and began balancing their hormones, their symptoms
consistently disappeared.</P>

<P>Which led me to ask: How often do symptoms of hormone imbalance
in young women go unnoticed and undiagnosed in the general population?
Clearly these young women were not aberrations. They were suffering
with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), bloating, breast
tenderness, mood swings, loss of sex drive, hot flashes, and night
sweats. These were serious symptoms and needed to be brought into
the open and addressed.</P>

<P>I didn't remember reading any medical literature addressing
symptoms of hormone imbalance in populations outside the standard
menopause age group. Before I put this surprising information
into my book, I decided to review the scientific literature and find
out what other hormone experts had found.</P>

<P>I turned to the medical literature looking for statistical data on
age distribution and frequency of symptoms of hormone imbalance
at different ages. Not only did I find nothing on age distribution,
but I also found no adequate information on the presence of symptoms
of hormone imbalance in other age groups besides menopause.</P>

<P>Medical textbooks of obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine,
and endocrinology, clinical manuals, medical journals in the
United States and abroad, rarely addressed the incidence of symptoms
of hormone imbalance in young women similar to those suffered
by menopausal women. Few, if any, medical textbooks
addressed the connection between hormone imbalances and symptoms
such as PMS and depression in young women. The only time
that medical literature addressed symptoms and connected them to
hormone imbalance was when women were either sick or
menopausal.</P>

<P>The first people who connected the symptoms of hormone imbalance
(PMS, depression, and so forth) to hormone imbalances
were doctors who were not writing medical textbooks or journals-
they wrote books and articles that were meant to be read by women
themselves. Books such as No More Hot Flashes and Other Good
News by Dr. Penny Wise Budoff (1983), Women's Bodies, Women's
Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing by Dr.
Christiane Northrup (first published in 1994), and Screaming to Be
Heard: Hormonal Connections Women Suspect. . . and Doctors Ignore
by Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet (1995) asked women to take responsibility
for bringing their knowledge to the attention of their
physicians.</P>

<P>Over the years, I have found that popular (nonscientific) literature
is sometimes ahead of the medical journals because it needs to
be in touch with its readers to survive. But in this case, even the
nonscientific literature was difficult to find. With the exception of
the above-mentioned books, I found few books written before 1996
that specifically addressed symptoms of hormone imbalance in any
age group, not even books on menopause (there was one exception-
a book written in 1968 by Robert Wilson, called Feminine
Forever, which was sponsored by Wyeth [then Ayerst] pharmaceuticals
promoting the rejuvenating effects of its new drug Premarin).</P>

<P>Then, in the mid-1990s, the floodgates of menopause burst open.
A tide of literature addressing issues surrounding hormone imbalances
in menopausal women swept the consumer market. I read
every one I could get my hands on. They all addressed menopause
and the symptoms created by the loss of hormones associated with
aging. But I found myself wondering why anybody would expect the
symptoms of hormone imbalance to just appear out of nowhere
around the age of forty-five to fifty. Why would we look at hormone
changes in a vacuum, as a sudden incident rather than part of the
continuum of hormone changes? Isn't life a continuum?</P>

<P>Back in my practice, I continued to see women of all ages with
complaints of hormone imbalance. I became determined to acknowledge
and validate the presence of the symptoms regardless of
age.</P>

<P><EM>The Hormone Solution</EM> was published in April 2002. Since then, I've
been seeing even more young women in my practice. They call from
around the country and around the world, seeking advice and information.
Many have been experiencing undiagnosed severe symptoms
for years. Others are just fearful of finding themselves out of hormones
in their forties and fifties without preparation. They say, "I don't want
to wind up like my mother, suddenly old and sick and overwhelmed
by symptoms of menopause."</P>

<P>Once you realize that hormone imbalance can occur at any age,
you can take a proactive role and learn to identify the symptoms,
connect them to hormone issues, and then treat them following a
thorough and all-inclusive program. My research enabled me to
break down frequency of symptoms according to age into five major
groupings.</P>

<P><B>LIFE CYCLES AND HORMONES</B></P>

<P>From puberty to menopause, our bodies constantly manufacture
hormones. There is always an ebb and flow of hormonal activity
going on, often in cycles. The most familiar of these is the menstrual
cycle. There are, however, other equally important cycles
that impact our hormone balance, some of them internal and some
external.</P>

<P>The internal cycle most readily known and studied is the regular
(or irregular) monthly cycle our bodies create to keep hormones in
balance and help us perpetuate the species by making young
women fertile every month. Menstrual cycles vary during a
woman's life span. Menstrual regularity at twenty-eight to thirty
days is the norm, but statistical data on frequency and cycling of
menstruation show enormous variation. Although we rarely read
these facts, it appears that menstruation cycles vary from fifteen to
sixty to ninety days in women without any diagnosed illnesses or
problems with conception. A growing school of thought affirms
that regularity of the menstrual cycle is unimportant as long as fertility
is unaffected.</P>

<P>The only problem with unpredictable periods is in the area of
pregnancy prevention. Ovulation, and the forty-eight hours of fertility
that ensue, occurs fifteen days before the next menstruation.
The main reason that relying on rhythm method for contraception
doesn't work is that, because the number of days in the menstrual
cycle isn't consistent, you can only guess at when it's fifteen days
before your next period. Birth control pills prevent ovulation and
override the woman's normal cycle by creating a synthetic, externally
induced cycle of twenty-eight days. No ovulation, no pregnancy.</P>

<P>The question is, how healthy is this for the normal internal
cycle? Science has no answers yet. Research is sparse, and little is
being done to my knowledge to investigate the issue further.</P>

<P>External cycles are mostly life cycles. Environmental temperature
and seasonal changes, for instance, often translate into serious
hormonal changes. The thyroid gland, our internal thermostat,
helps us adjust to heat and cold. Modern society has altered the
natural hormonal transition involved in the seasonal changes
through air-conditioning and central heating. Sudden temperature
shifts often affect our cycles and create problems we are not even
aware of.</P>

<P>Becoming aware of the effect of external cycles and sudden
changes becomes important in our quest to understand what throws
our hormone balance off and when. The better the grasp we have
of the cycle we're in at any given time, the easier it is to follow the
program to keep our hormones in balance and prevent serious illness.</P>


<P><B>MEASURING HORMONES</B></P>

<P>Patients often ask, "How do I know if my hormones are balanced?"
When your hormones are in balance, you feel well. And typically,
you have energy and don't crave salty or sweet foods. Your
weight is stable, and your sleep pattern is consistent and uninterrupted.
When you wake up in the morning, you are well rested and
raring to start another day. You feel and look young and healthy.</P>

<P>Perhaps the above picture doesn't quite represent you. You don't
feel quite that well, you suspect your hormone balance might be off,
and you'd like to get a professional opinion on whether or not your
hormones are in balance. Then you might ask, "How do you measure
hormone balance?"</P>

<P>Unfortunately, present methods of testing, in my opinion, make
it impossible to gain valid tests that offer realistic insights into our
hormone balance. There are some blood tests that can measure individual
hormones such as thyroid and testosterone. While estrogen
and progesterone levels can also be measured, these
measurements do not reflect the presence or absence of symptoms.</P>

<P>We have no tests to help us extract usable information that connects
blood, saliva, or urine levels of estrogen and progesterone to
symptoms of hormone imbalance.</P>

<P>This makes it difficult, to say the least, to grasp the intricacies of
balancing hormones.</P>

<P>Without being able to measure them or see them, how can we
connect them to such obvious and unbearable problems as hot
flashes, night sweats, depression, and loss of libido? The only information
we can rely on comes from the medical subspecialty of endocrinology.
Unfortunately, endocrinology focuses on illness, so
most of the information we have is about hormonal behavior after
we've become ill.</P>

<P>So for now, there is no scientific answer. Until reliable tests are
developed and proven to work, we are left to decide on our own
and with the help of our physicians whether our hormones are in
balance or not. Because I have found that no existing blood, urine,
or saliva test can encompass the scope of hormone fluctuations inside
the human body, I believe that subjective measurement is
today the only reliable method of measurement for hormone balance-
in other words, it's vital to learn to read and listen to your
own body's messages.</P>

<P><B>REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS</B></P>
<P>What our bodies tell us and what we want to hear are not always the
same thing. We Americans are not experts at reasonable expectations.
We are a nation developed from the philosophy of pushing the
envelope. Many of today's health and wellness problems stem from
this mentality. We believe nothing is impossible, which has allowed
us to become the most highly developed country in the world, with
the highest life expectancy. But we can push the limits only so far. Our
bodies are not as evolved as our minds. If we want to survive into advanced
age in good balance and with minimal infirmity, we must
learn to listen to our bodies-within reason.</P>

<P>What is reasonable at fifteen may be crazy at forty. And what is
reasonable to a man is not necessarily reasonable for a woman. We
must learn whether our hormone balance is in concert with reasonable
expectations. And we must understand that reasonable expectations
must be considered before alterations to our hormone
balance are undertaken.</P>

<P>Mark was sixty-eight when he came to see me. He wanted to regain
some of the vim and vigor he had enjoyed earlier in his life.
He had read about testosterone improving stamina in males and
wanted to try it-not so much for sexual enhancement as to improve
his skiing. As unusual as the request might sound, it's
common for me to see patients who have specific problems that
they expect hormones to solve. After evaluating his blood tests,
testosterone levels, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels,
and receiving a clean bill of health from his primary physician,
I prescribed Mark 20 mg of micronized testosterone in cream
form for three months.</P>

<P>When he came back to see me for a two-month follow-up
visit, he was ecstatic. His skiing had improved, and his sex drive
had picked up speed. A blood check confirmed a rise in his
testosterone levels. Mark was on a roll.
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, his good luck came to a crashing halt halfway
down a double-black-diamond slope. Mark had relied too much on
hormones to improve his performance, and not enough on practicing
his skiing. He skied beyond his ability, broke his thighbone,
and required major surgery. Recovery took six months; he lost a
whole skiing season and was left with a permanent limp.</P>

<P>Mark is a perfect example of unreasonable expectations. Although
testosterone was a great boost, it could not make his
sixty-eight-year-old body twenty years old again. Mark should
have used the improvement in his well-being to improve his
muscle strength and build better resistance and balance rather
than increase his speed and reckless behavior on the ski slopes.</P>

<P>Looking at Mark's example, we realize that balancing hormones
alone is not enough. That's why the 30-Day Plan gives you more
than the prescription for natural hormones you need to obtain improvement
in your hormone balance. It will help you identify and
then use your personal state of homeostasis in concert with reasonable
expectations to help you achieve long-lasting health, vitality,
and great quality of life.
