<div><B>Chapter Excerpt</B></div><BR><h3 align="center">Chapter One</h3>

<p><em>My grandfather was an unpleasant old man. After he
died, I frequently heard my grandmother say she
missed him like a wooden leg. Though she'd grown
used to his bark over the years, she didn't miss a single
splinter and limped along just fine without him.</em></p>

<p align="center">Mrs. Welterby to the Countess of Firth,<br />
while waiting for the Prince to make an appearance<br />
in the drawing room of Carlton House</p>

<p>Devon St. John paced before the fireplace, his hands
clasped behind his back, his brow furrowed. His abrupt footfalls,
silenced by the thick rug that stretched the length of
the huge chamber, were overshadowed by the crackle of
burning logs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he halted before a large wing-back chair turned
toward the warming flames. "I know. You can tell him."</p>

<p>"<em>Me?</em>" His brother, Brandon, shook his head, the firelight
casting blue shadows through his black hair. "The last time I
delivered bad news to Marcus, he sent me to oversee the
holdings in northern Scotland for a month. I nearly froze to
death."</p>

<p>Chase glanced up from where he slouched on the settee
opposite. "I was once sent to the wilds of Yorkshire in the
middle of the season for an equally inane reason. And that
was back during the time when our brother was tolerable."</p>

<p>"Which has not been of late," Brandon said.</p>

<p>Chase nodded morosely. "Lately, he has been nothing but
a seething mass of ill temper. God knows where he'd order us
now if he had a true reason to be upset."</p>

<p>Devon sighed heavily. "I must apologize to all of you; this
is my fault."</p>

<p>The last and quietest member of the gathering finally
stirred to life. Devon's half brother, Anthony Elliot, the Earl
of Greyley, stretched his legs toward the fire from the depths
of a huge red velvet chair. He surveyed Devon with a sleepy
air. "Nonsense. The ring was lost by accident and nothing
more."</p>

<p>"I should have made more of an effort to find it. But somehow,
I thought it would be humorous to send Marcus chasing
about for the blasted thing."</p>

<p>"It was amusing," Brandon said, "until Marcus could not
find it. You sent Marcus the guest list for the ball where the
ring disappeared, and we were all certain that ring would be
in the hands of one of those guests."</p>

<p>Chase nodded. "Indeed, had the guests not brought guests
of their own -- that is where we caught cold. And now Marcus's
humor wears more thin as the days pass and the ring is
not found. He's like a great bear denied his food."</p>

<p>Anthony shrugged. "So let him growl. He is but a man."</p:>

<p>"You know what Marcus is," Devon said. "Our brother is a
gale wind in a world of gentle breezes."</p>

<p>Brandon sighed and slouched back in his chair. "He defi-
nitely has some very odd notions about marriage. I'm in poor
case with him this very moment because Verena's father got
into some trouble with the Italian authorities and I had to pay
the scoundrel's way out of it. Marcus disapproved mightily."</p>

<p>Chase's brows lowered. "What else could you do? It's Verena's
father."</p>

<p>"Marcus does not seem to understand that when you marry
a woman, to some extent, you also marry her family."</p>

<p>"There's a lot about marriage Marcus doesn't understand,"
Anthony murmured, reclaiming his glass of port and taking
another sip. "He seems to understand the concept of having a
mistress far better."</p>

<p>"That he does. But a wife is a different matter altogether."
Chase rose from the settee and stretched his arms over his
head before crossing to the desk to pour himself a drink from
a crystal decanter. "Lately he's been snappish. In fact, Harriet
wanted to invite him to our new house for the holidays -- "</p>

<p>"Excellent!" Brandon said, brightening immediately.
"Bloody excellent!"</p>

<p>Everyone looked his way.</p>

<p>"Oh uhm, sorry." Brandon smiled uneasily. "Verena had
the same idea, though I had no wish to have Marcus growling
his way through our holidays. She and I finally agreed that
we would invite him only if none of you did. But since Chase
and Harriet are going to invite him -- "</p>

<p>"You didn't give me time to finish my sentence," Chase
said. "Harriet <em>wanted</em> to invite him, but then reconsidered.
There's precious little to entertain Marcus out in the country,
and since Harriet's not feeling well ... " Chase grinned a little
as he lifted his glass in a seeming toast. "Yet another reason
I'm glad my lovely wife is increasing."</p>

<p>Brandon grimaced. "I wish Verena was increasing as well,
especially if it would keep Marcus away from us during the
holidays. He's become a grump. Only yesterday he said that
Christmas was a waste of time and energy and he hated all
the fuss."</p>

<p>Devon sighed. "He's impossible. He hasn't spoken a civil
word to me since I lost the ring, and that was months ago. I
must admit, I thought the blasted thing would be easier to re-cover than this." He rubbed his chin, a frown in his blue eyes.
"It's almost as if the ring doesn't wish to be found."</p>

<p>Silence met this. Finally, Chase cleared his throat. "We
have never really talked about it, but ... are we all agreed
about the ring?" He eyed his brothers carefully. "The legend
is true?"</p>

<p>Anthony noted that his other brothers appeared uneasy
with that bold question. The silence grew thick and then
thicker. He supposed he couldn't fault them; after all, the
ring had contributed in some way to each of their marriages.
"I don't know about anyone else, but I believe it."
