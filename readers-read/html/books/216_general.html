<br>
<P>It all simply comes down to good guys and bad guys. As a kid, I
wanted to be like Roy Rogers, the good-guy cowboy of all time.
Roy and his horse, Trigger, would go riding through the movies,
helping those in peril while never seeming to sweat, get a scratch,
or wrinkle a pair of perfectly creased blue jeans. When the day
was over, they would join the Sons of Pioneers by the campfire
and sing the sun to sleep. Now that is what I called the perfect job.</P>

<P>One day, long ago in another place and another time, I was
playing out my fantasy of being Roy with my childhood pals in
the rolling hills above Heartache, Wyoming, where I was raised.
We were racing our horses, bat-out-of-hell style, through the
aspen grove that led to our little ranch. Like a true daredevil, I
passed my friends in a wild sprint to the finish line, and once I
had the lead, I turned around to admire my move as the leader
of the pack. The next thing I remembered was waking up on the
ground, my head covered with blood, my left arm pointing in the
wrong direction, and pain - lots of pain - shooting through
my young body. That's when I knew that life wasn't a movie.</P>

<P>During my mending process, I discovered a new role model
in Butch Cassidy, who took me through my teenage years. He
wasn't perfect. He made mistakes, and that seemed more in
tune with the way my life was working out in the real world. He
thumbed his nose at authority. To put it in today's terms, Butch
Cassidy didn't work for The Man. He was his own man. He ran
away to Patagonia.</P>

<P>The West was changing, and so was I. Now, looking back, I
have to thank old Roy for teaching me that when you fall from
your horse, you climb back in the saddle and plow ahead. From
Butch, I figured out that what I wanted to be was my own
man - just a good guy with a few bad habits. This is Tully Mars
reporting in.</P>

<P>When I left Wyoming some years ago and made a not-so-difficult
choice between becoming a poodle-ranch foreman or a
tropical expatriate, I tossed a massage table through the giant
plate-glass window of the ranch house owned by my former boss
and modern-day witch Thelma Barston. That day, heading off to
freedom, I made myself a promise. As I fled across America, I
swore I would never again work for anybody but me. I pretty
much kept that promise until I met Cleopatra Highbourne.</P>

<P>Cleopatra Highbourne is my present boss and the woman
who brought me here to this salty piece of land in the southern
Bahamas. She hired me to restore a 150-year-old lighthouse on
Cayo Loco, which she owns, having swapped for it with the Bahamian
government for some property on Bay Street in Nassau.
To begin with, Cleopatra is 101 years old, but she doesn't
look a day over 80. She is the captain of her beautiful schooner,
the <EM>Lucretia,</EM> which was a present from her father on her eighteenth
birthday.</P>

<P>Cleopatra has simply defied the aging process. Her eyes are
a piercing green, and her speech is lilted with an island accent
that is somewhere between Jamaican and Cuban. There isn't a
romance language or Caribbean patois she doesn't speak like a
native, and there isn't an island she hasn't set foot on between
Bimini and Bonaire. Her skeleton is erect, which she attributes
to being a practitioner of yoga for eighty years, having been
taught the craft by Gandhi himself. She wears no hearing aids
or glasses. Her skin is void of the weathered, leatherlike appearance
caused by age, ocean, and ultraviolet exposure. She never
smoked cigarettes, but she has her daily ration of rum and occasionally
will puff a little opium if she is feeling ill. She also has
a taste for Cuban cigars.</P>

<P>She dines on fish, rice, and tropical fruits, and a collection of
potions, teas, and elixirs keep her biorhythms, brain, and sense
of humor humming. She cusses like the sailor that she is, and
she is rabidly addicted to Cuban baseball.</P>

<P>Though she says she has a few good years left in her, Cleopatra
is on a most urgent mission, and that is where I come in. I
am here to rebuild the lighthouse as her final resting place while
she continues her search for an original Fresnel lens, which was
the light source for this and many other old lighthouses.</P>

<P>So how does a cowboy wind up as a lighthouse keeper? Well,
I didn't fill out any job application. How I went from the saddle,
to the deck of a schooner, to the tower of this lighthouse still
baffles me. But I believe in the aboriginal line of thinking that
life's adventures are the verses and choruses of your unique
song, and when it is over, you are dead. So far, I am still singing,
but I would point out that adventures don't come calling like unexpected
cousins visiting from out of town. You have to go look-ing
for them, and that is exactly how I wound up on Cayo Loco.</P>

<P>I saw Cayo Loco for the first time from the deck of the <EM>Lucretia.</EM>
All I knew about lighthouses up until that point was that they
were warning lights, and they marked some kind of trouble. I'd
heard a few stories, and I'd met a guy who had some theories
about them, but that was it. I sat in a dinghy next to Cleopatra
as the crew pulled for the shore, and the lighthouse loomed so
huge that I had to lean my entire head back just to see the top.
"This is it," Cleopatra said to me as we made our way toward
the beach. "I traded those bumbling bureaucrats in Nassau a
building they needed for a Junkanoo museum on Bay Street for
her. I think we both came out okay. All we have to do is fix her
up and get the light back in shape."</P>

<P>"No problem," I said, shrugging. After what I had recently
been through, fixing up an old lighthouse sounded like a piece
of cake.</P>

<P>As the bottom of the dinghy brushed against the shallow
sand, Cleopatra sprang to the beach like a teenager. I had to
laugh. Three months earlier, my life was rolling by at a snail's
pace, and I was sitting on the beach in Mexico, wondering if the
day would ever end. Then, all of a sudden, a ship carries me to a
completely foreign place that would now become my home.</P>

<P>Solomon, Cleopatra's first mate, buried the anchor in the
sand. All you had to do was look at his huge body, his kind eyes,
and his weathered hands to know that he was the kind of person
you wanted running your crew and your ship. "I'll stay with da
boat, Cap'n," he said.</P>

<P>"Then I'll be the tour guide," Cleopatra said. She nodded at
a narrow path up through the dunes. "Welcome to Cayo Loco,
Tully Mars."</P>

<P>The well-worn path from the beach snaked up through the
small dunes and then disappeared up the hill into a cluster of
sea oats. We stopped at the top of the hill and looked down on
the wreckage of time. With the exception of the light tower itself,
the place looked as if someone had dropped a bomb on it.
The concrete walls of what had been the compound of the lighthouse keeper came into view. The windows had been blown out,
and the roof had been partially burned off.</P>

<P>We made our way through the overgrown paths, pushing
back thorny bougainvillea bushes, sea grapes, and hibiscus
blooms that camouflaged more destruction.</P>

<P>"This is the old cistern," Cleopatra said as we walked across
a large rectangle. "This place was one of the first spots on earth
where they made freshwater out of salt water. Those damn
limeys have a strange fascination for remote and desolate
places, but you got to hand it to them - they knew how to bring
creature comforts to the boondocks. When Solomon's father
was the light keeper here, this place was a little piece of paradise.</P>

<P>There was a vegetable garden, flowered paths, and even a
manicured green lawn."</P>

<P>At close range, even the tower showed the ravages of salt and
sea. I stared up at the peeling paint and the cracks in the outer
wall.</P>

<P>"Good morning, St. Peter," Cleopatra said as she stopped before
a large, thick spiderweb strung across our path. Its weaver,
a nasty-looking purple-and-yellow spider the size of my hand,
hung suspended across the path. He seemed ready to defend his
territory. There was no doubt that this was a web you could not
just brush away without consequences.</P>

<P>"You know this spider?" I asked Cleopatra.
"He's perfectly harmless, if you don't piss him off," she replied.
We detoured around St. Peter and walked in the brush between
two small buildings. A raccoon exploded out of the underbrush
and scurried off toward the beach.</P>

<P>"I thought you said this island was uninhabited," I said.
Cleopatra didn't answer.</P>

<P>While I stood in the rubble looking around, I began to have
serious doubts. Then a banging noise caught my attention, and
I turned around to see Cleopatra hammering away at a padlock
with the butt end of her machete. It was chained to a large iron
door at the base of the lighthouse. Walking over, I waded through a
toxic dump of decaying lead acid batteries that encircled the light
tower. The people who'd been in charge of maintaining the automated
light had simply tossed the dead batteries from the tower
when they replaced them, adding to the bombed-out look of the
cottages and grounds of the keeper's residence.</P>

<P>I looked from the rubble up to the lines of the giant lighthouse
and the blue sky above it. On the voyage over to the Bahamas,
Cleopatra had told me the story of where the lighthouse
came from and how it had gotten here. Even though the light-house
had seen better days, the sheer strength of it was still very
much apparent. I just stood there and stared up, wondering
how in the hell they'd built it.</P>

<P>"This goddamn salt air will eat anything. I just put this lock
on here last month."</P>

<P>I went over to lend a hand. After a few more direct hits with
a big rock, the padlock sprang, and I pried the iron door open.
It creaked and squeaked and let out a thud as it banged against
the wall.</P>

<P>Inside, it was dark and hot and smelled like shit.
"Here," Cleopatra said, handing me a flashlight.
I followed her with the beam of my flashlight, trying to keep
pace as she bounced ahead of me like Becky Thatcher while I
cautiously navigated the winding staircase.
Our movements echoed off the iron cylindrical walls as we
climbed through musty, humid air that had been trapped inside
the lighthouse for God knows how long. Several furry little fruit
bats scanned us with their radar as they fluttered around my
head.</P>

<P>"Don't worry," Cleopatra called out. "I know a way to get the
bats out of here when you move in."</P>

<P>Up and up we circled, until small beams of light appeared at
the top. Cleopatra stopped on the stairs below the source of the
light - a rusty hatch cover just above us. "I always like this
part," she said. "It reminds me of the time I met Thomas Edison
- the night he threw the switch that lit up the Brooklyn
Bridge at the three hundredth celebration of the founding of the
city of New York."</P>

<P>"You knew Thomas Edison?" I asked.
"No, my father did. We were in New York on our way to
France and boarding school, and we just happened to be at the
right place at the right time."</P>

<P>I followed the beam of Cleopatra's flashlight as we inched up
slowly.</P>

<P>"Electricity ain't a bad contribution to the betterment of
mankind in general, but it sure as hell wreaked havoc on the
lighthouse keepers of the world. The record player would have
to go on the top of my list of Edison inventions, way ahead of
movies and lightbulbs."</P>

<P>Cleopatra took a marlinespike out of the case on her belt and
jabbed away at the hinges of the hatch. The hatch gave way with
a creak.</P>

<P>"Ready?" Cleopatra asked.
Sunlight flooded down around us. We lifted ourselves through
the hole in the sky, and I stood there bathed in the morning light
of the glass room. Below us, the <EM>Lucretia </EM>looked like a toy boat
sitting at anchor on the smooth surface of crystal clear water
that seemed to be only inches deep. But in fact it was in nearly
thirty feet of water.</P>

<P>I could see several members of the crew diving up conch
from the bottom. The view from the light tower encompassed
the whole island, against a backdrop of turquoise shallows and
the deep blue ocean beyond. Cleopatra pointed out the landmarks
of Whale Cut, Boo Hoo Hill, and Osprey Point that I
would come to know as well as my horse.</P>

<P>"Unbelievable" was all I could muster.
"And well worth saving, don't you think?"
"I get the picture."</P>

<P>"Except for that," she added, pointing to the bizarre tangle of
frayed wires, makeshift junction boxes, and a strobe light resting
atop a long, skinny shaft. "That has to go. The original lens
that came with this light was not only a piece of engineering genius
but a work of art. The lenses, circular prisms, and source
that created the beam of light is called the bull's-eye because it
looks like a clear glass target. A French physicist named Augustin
Fresnel designed it in the early eighteen hundreds."
"How did it work?" I asked her.</P>

<P>"The prisms concentrated the burner's light into a piercing
beam that shot out to the horizon. The crystal lenses were held
together by brass plates, and the whole thing weighed about
four tons and floated in a circular tub containing about twelve
hundred pounds of quicksilver. That allowed it to spin in a near
frictionless environment. It was rotated by a clockwork assembly
of ropes and weights that hung down the shaft of the lighthouse,
and it had to be wound every two hours by the lighthouse
keeper on duty. The sword of light it stabbed out into the darkness
could be seen for twenty miles." Cleopatra paused as if remembering
specific images. "Seen from the deck of a ship, it
radiates its presence like nothing else on earth. Sailors call it the
soul of the light."</P>

<P>"I guess all that beauty and precision seemed way too complicated
for the twentieth century," I said.</P>

<P>"You would have thought that such a thing of beauty would
wind up in a museum, but not here. They severed the base with
a blowtorch, shoved it out the window, and just let gravity finish
the job. Thus, the soul of the light was ripped out, smashed on
the rocks, and the brass frame that once held the intricate Fresnel-lens
system in place was sold for scrap." Cleopatra let out a big
sigh. "That is what replaced it," she said, pointing at the present
light source. "In a modern world, there is just no time for hand pumping kerosene or winding a clock. In the name of progress,
they turned the Cayo Loco Light into a giant toaster."
As we wound our way down the steps and finally out of
the dark interior of the lighthouse, Cleopatra also wound me
around her finger. Her mission was to find a bull's-eye lens before
she died.</P>

<P>"You can't just order one up from the True Value hardware
man," she told me. "It's a needle-in-a-haystack thing, but I'll find
one. In the meantime, we have to rebuild this place and make it
look like it did in its heyday, and that is where you come in."
Back out in the fresh breeze at the base of the tower, Cleopatra
reached into the pocket of her pants and pulled out a key.
"Tully, I've been around long enough to know that the bullshit
people heap on one another is more toxic than all the oil refineries
in Texas, so I will come straight to the point. I know it
all must sound wacko, coming from a bat-shit crazy old woman
like me who you met on the beach in Mexico, but I think fate
has somehow thrown us together. It seems that I bailed your ass
out of trouble back there, so the way the karma thing works, I
think you owe me one."</P>

<P>"I couldn't agree more."
"Well, it occurred to me that maybe you could hang around
here and fix the place up while I go find us a light," she continued.</P>

<P>"I have no problem with that," I told her. A hideaway in the
middle of nowhere was something I could use at the time.
"This job ain't gonna be no little fixer-upper, you know, but I
just somehow know that you can do it."</P>

<P>"Well, I think I can."
With that, Cleopatra gave me a big, long hug, which was witnessed
by St. Peter, hanging down from the branch of a sea
grape. "I just want to show you one more thing before we go,
and then we will go."</P>

<P>We walked past a battered radio antenna and then around
the back of the light tower. Cleopatra started to laugh. "You
know, when I was a lot younger, I had me a cowboy once. They
weren't much on huggin', but they got the job done," she said.
"There," she added and pointed at a corroded, half-moon-shaped
object near the base of the tower. The sea grape branches had
snaked their way through what looked like bolt-holes, and the
piece of iron had become a part of the tree.</P>

<P>"What is that?" I asked.
"That is the old collar of the bull's-eye that they threw out of
the light tower." Cleopatra gazed up at the tower and the indigo
sky above. "At first, I wanted to cut it down and hang it on the
door as a reminder of what I needed to accomplish, but then I
decided it meant more where it was."</P>

<P>"I like that approach, boss," I said. "I'll clean up this mess.
You go and find us a bull's-eye lens. We are going to rekindle the
soul of the light."</P>

<P>She didn't say anything but stood there with tears in her big
green eyes. St. Peter suddenly appeared on one of the branches
of the sea grape as if he were bearing witness to a historic event.
Then she handed me the key to the lighthouse door.</P>

<P>That was the day I became the keeper of the Cayo Loco Light.
