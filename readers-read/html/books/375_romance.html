<h3 align="center">Chapter One</h3>

<em><blockquote><p>England, 1806</p>

<p>My dear Miss March,</p>

<p>I pray you'll forgive me for being presumptuous
enough to contact you in this rather unconventional
manner ...</p></blockquote></em>

<p>"So tell me, Miss Wickersham, have you any
experience?"</p>

<p>From somewhere deep in the sprawling Jacobean
mansion, a tremendous crash sounded.</p>

<p>Although the portly butler who was conducting
the interview visibly flinched and the housekeeper
standing at rigid attention beside the tea
table let out an audible squeak, Samantha refused
to so much as blink.</p>

<p>Instead, she drew a neat packet of papers from
the side pocket of the battered leather portmanteau
resting at her feet and held them out. "I'm sure you'll find my letters of reference are in order,
Mr. Beckwith."</p>

<p>Although it was midday, the light in the modest
breakfast parlor was abysmal. Shafts of sunlight
bled through the cracks in the heavy velvet
drapes, striping the rich ruby weave of the Turkish
carpet. The wax candles scattered across the
occasional tables filled the corners with flickering
shadows. The room smelled musty and
close, as if it had gone unaired for ages. If not for
the absence of black swags over the windows
and mirrors, Samantha would have sworn someone
very dear to the household had recently
died.</p>

<p>The butler took the papers from her whitegloved
hand and unfolded them. As the housekeeper
craned her long neck to peer over his
shoulder, Samantha could only pray the dim
light would work to her advantage, preventing
them from studying the scrawled signatures
too closely. Mrs. Philpot was a handsome
woman of indeterminate age, as sleek and narrow
as the butler was round. Although her face
was unlined, silver frosted the black chignon
anchored at her nape.</p>

<p>"As you can see, I served two years as governess
for Lord and Lady Carstairs," Samantha
informed Mr. Beckwith as he gave the papers a
cursory thumbing-through. "Once the war resumed,
I joined several other governesses in volunteering
to treat sailors and soldiers who returned from sea or the front with debilitating
wounds."</p>

<p>The housekeeper could not quite hide the faint
tightening of her lips. Samantha knew there were
still those in society who believed women who
nursed soldiers to be little more than glorified
camp followers. Immodest creatures who
wouldn't even blush to look upon a strange man's
nakedness. Feeling heat rise to her own cheeks,
Samantha lifted her chin another notch.</p>

<p>Mr. Beckwith examined her over the top of his
wire-rimmed spectacles. "I must confess, Miss
Wickersham, that you're a trifle bit ... younger
than what we had in mind. Such strenuous duty
might require a woman of more ...ma turity.
Perhaps one of the other applicants ... " At
Samantha's arch look, he trailed off.</p>

<p>"I don't see any other applicants, Mr.Beckwith,"
she pointed out, sliding her own ill-fitting spectacles up her nose with one finger.
"Given the generous, even extravagant, wages
you offered in your advertisement, I fully expected
to find them lined up outside your
gates."</p>

<p>Another crash came, this one even closer than
the last. It sounded as if some sort of massive
beast were lumbering toward its den.</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot hastened around the chair, her
starched petticoats rustling. "Would you care for
some more tea, my dear?" As she poured from
the porcelain pot, her hand trembled so violently that tea splashed over the rim of Samantha's
saucer and into her lap.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Samantha murmured, surreptitiously
dabbing at the spreading stain with her
glove.</p>

<p>The floor beneath their feet visibly shuddered,
as did Mrs. Philpot. The muffled roar that followed
was peppered by a string of mercifully
unintelligible oaths. There could no longer be
any denying it. Someone -- or something -- was
approaching.</p>

<p>Casting a panicked look at the gilded double
door that led to the next chamber, Mr. Beckwith
lurched to his feet, his prominent brow glistening
with sweat. "Perhaps this isn't the most opportune
time ... "</p>

<p>As he shoved the letters of reference back at
Samantha, Mrs. Philpot whisked the cup and
saucer out of her other hand and deposited them
back on the tea cart with a noisy rattle. "Beckwith
is right, my dear. You'll have to forgive us.
We may have been entirely too hasty ... " The
woman pulled Samantha to her feet and began
to tug her away from the door and toward the
heavily curtained French windows that led to
the terrace.</p>

<p>"But my bag!" Samantha protested, casting
the portmanteau a helpless glance over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, child," Mrs. Philpot assured
her, gritting her teeth in a kindly smile. "We'll have one of the footmen bring it out to your
hack." As the thunderous crashing and cursing
swelled, the woman dug her nails into the sturdy
brown wool of Samantha's sleeve and yanked
her into motion. Mr. Beckwith dashed around
them and whipped open one of the floor-toceiling
windows, flooding the gloom with bright
April sunshine. But before Mrs. Philpot could
urge Samantha through it, the mysterious racket
ceased.</p>

<p>The three of them turned as one to gaze at the
gilded doors on the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no sound at all except
for the delicate ticking of the French gilt clock on
the mantel. Then came a most curious noise, as if
something were fumbling, or perhaps even
scratching, at the doors. Something large. And
angry. Samantha took an involuntary step backward;
the housekeeper and butler exchanged an
apprehensive glance.</p>

<p>The doors came flying open, striking the opposite
walls with a mighty crash. Framed by
their wings was not a beast, but a man -- or what
was left of one after all the genteel veneer of society
had been stripped away. His tawny hair,
shaggy from neglect, hung well past his shoulders.
Shoulders that came close to filling the
breadth of the doorway. A pair of buckskin pantaloons
clung to his lean hips and hugged every
curve of his muscular calves and thighs. Several
days' growth of beard shadowed his jaw, lending his visage a piratical aspect. </p>
