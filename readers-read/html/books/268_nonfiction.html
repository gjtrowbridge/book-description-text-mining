<p align="center"><b><font size="3" face="Verdana">Introduction
I: Smart Doctors, Foolish Forecasts</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have a doctor friend who so believed
 in the value of synthetic estrogens that when the National Institutes of
Health  announced a large clinical trial to compare these pills with sugar
pills, she  dismissed it as a waste of money. "Obviously, the women on the
hormones will be  living longer," she said. "It's unethical to leave volunteers
on the placebos  for the full eight and a half years of the trial. At some
point they'll have to  stop the study and offer hormones to everyone."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Her colleagues concurred, but then
the opposite came true. On the morning of July 9, 2002, my friend, along with
other physicians and the 30 million U.S. patients taking estrogen products,
woke up to discover that the world, after all, was flat. A safety-monitoring
board had suddenly halted a part of the study involving 16,608 women because
those taking hormones had more breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary
embolisms, and blood clots than those taking sugar pills. Yes, the volunteers
on Prempro also had fewer bone fractures and less colon cancer. But  not enough
to balance out the risks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">My friend initially heard the startling results
on Good Morning America, where Dr. Tim Johnson described this "somewhat surprising
outcome." He predicted that most women then taking hormone pills would stop
"after talking to their physicians today," failing to anticipate that many
doctors would take their telephones off the hook. My friend switched the channel
to CNN, where Paula Zahn repeatedly exclaimed: "I tell you -- women gotta
go insane today." Channel surfing, my friend caught up with the "usual suspects,"
certain doctors familiar to TV viewers whose spin skills had been developed
by public-relations coaches at agencies that handle pharmaceutical accounts.
It was then that my friend got it. These physicians were appearing on stations
where paid ads suggested that if only we took estrogen we could look like
Lauren Hutton and sing like Patti LaBelle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">That night my friend called me to apologize
for  having objected to the title I planned for this book. She had called
it "over  the top and ridiculous," but now she said she could almost agree.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">WHAT IS THE GREATEST EXPERIMENT?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">While the Prempro arm of the
Women's Health Initiative, which lasted 5.2 years and included 16,608 women,
was a major test, it is only a small part of what I consider to be <i> The
Greatest Experiment Ever Performed on Women</i>. The experiment began in
England in 1938, and it has continued for sixty-five years. A British  biochemist,
desperate to prevent Nazi Germany from cornering the world market on  synthetic
sex hormones, published his formula for cheap and powerful oral  estrogen.
Within months, thousands of doctors and scores of drug companies  around the
world were working with this formula.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">That opened the Greatest  Experiment.
Products made from chemicals that mimicked the feminizing effects of  a woman's
natural secretions were marketed fresh out of the lab. They were  prescribed
and sold for a host of concerns -- to slow and prevent aging, to stop  hot
flashes, to avoid pregnancy or miscarriage, and as a morning-after  contraceptive.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">I call the marketing, prescribing,
 and sale of these drugs an experiment because, for all these years, they
have  been used, in the main, for what doctors and scientists hope or believe
they can  do, not for what they know the products can do. Medical policy on
estrogens has  been to "shoot first and apologize later"-- to prescribe the
drugs for a certain  health problem and then see if there is a positive result.
Over the years,  hundreds of millions, possibly billions of women, have been
lab animals in this  unofficial trial. They were not volunteers. They were
given no consent forms.  And they were put at serious, often devastating risk.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The risks of these drugs have
been known and documented from the start. The British doctor who published
his estrogen formula in 1938 spent many years thereafter warning the world
that these drugs, although containing great promise, put women at serious
peril for endometrial and breast cancer. Since the halting of the Prempro
 trial in July, despite the ignorance or hypocrisy of many doctors who said
"Who  knew?," there is nothing surprising in the recent findings. We have
known since  day one that these drugs posed threats. And since then science
has added to, not  subtracted from, the list of estrogen's problems.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">If doctors and scientists have
 known these dirty secrets for so long, why is the bad press so recent? That
is  an essential question right now, and this book seeks to present the answer.
Part  of the answer lies in the vigorous efforts by drug companies to protect
an  invaluable market. These efforts have included underwriting studies and
 subsidizing doctors, participating in medical-school curriculums, advertising
 heavily in medical journals, and seeing that continuing medical education
is  directed by doctors on the drug industry's payroll. They have also entailed
one  of the most elaborate promotion and advertising campaigns in the history
of the  media not only in America but worldwide.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">This is not the first time estrogen
sales have felt the cold wind of consumer anger. In 1975, the magnitude of
estrogen-related endometrial  cancer was established; drug sales sank by half
in subsequent years. In that  instance, as in every other that has cast suspicion
on estrogen, the drug  companies managed to revitalize sales through new
claims, which is why I say  that only through learning how these companies
buy and influence medical opinion  can women protect themselves from any new
spin, any new claim that will  inevitably emerge about these drugs and countless
others.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Estrogen products won't go away,
and they shouldn't. One can only wish, as I do, that they will be used now
with caution, based on evidence and facts, not illusion. My aim is to consider
whether hormone supplements are necessary and for whom. Specifically, I hope
this book will help women navigate the estrogen issue and keep anything similar
from happening again. But the larger hope is that we can make informed decisions
about other drugs as well.�</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">On the sixty-fifth birthday of
the Greatest Experiment, I recall a poem by William Butler Yeats entitled
"The Corning of Wisdom with Time":� </font> </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Though leaves are many, the
root is one;�<br>
  Through all the lying days of my youth�<br>
  I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun�<br>
   Now I may wither into the truth.� </font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Let us hope.</font></p>
