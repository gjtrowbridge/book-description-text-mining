<p>Across the Spiral Arm, the gas-giant planets held secrets,
dangers, and treasure. For a century and a half, harvesting vital stardrive
fuel from the cloud worlds had been a lucrative business for the Roamers.</p>

<p>Five years ago, though, that had all changed.</p>

<p>Like vicious guard dogs, the hydrogues had forbidden all
skymines from approaching the gas giants they claimed as their territory. The
embargo had crippled the Roamer economy, the Terran Hanseatic League, and the
Ildiran Empire. Many brave or foolish entrepreneurs had defied the hydrogues'
ultimatum. They had paid with their lives. Dozens of skymines were destroyed.
The deep-core aliens were unstoppable and ruthless.</p>

<p>But when facing desperate situations, Roamers refused to
give up. Instead, they changed tactics, surviving&#151;and thriving&#151;through
innovation.</p>

<p>"The old Speaker always told us that challenges redefine the
parameters of success," Jess Tamblyn said over the open comm, taking his
lookout ship into position above the deceptively peaceful-looking gas giant
Welyr.</p>

<p>"By damn, Jess," Del Kellum transmitted with just a touch of
annoyance, "if I wanted to be pampered, I'd live on <i>Earth</i>."</p>

<p>Kellum, an older clan leader and hands-on industrialist,
signaled to the converging fast-dive scoop ships. The cluster of modified
"blitzkrieg" skymines and a hodgepodge of small lookout craft gathered at what
they hoped was a safe distance above the coppery planet. No one knew how far
away the hydrogues could detect trespassing cloud thieves, but they had long since
given up playing it safe. In the end, all life was a gamble, and human
civilization could not survive without stardrive fuel.</p>

<p>The ekti-scavenging crew powered up their huge scoops and
containers, ready for a concerted plunge into the thick cloud decks. Hit and
run. Their supercharged engines glowed warm. Their pilots sweated. Ready.</p>

<p>Alone in his lookout ship, Jess flexed his hands on the
cockpit controls. "Prepare to come from all sides. Move in fast, gulp a
bellyful, and head for safety. We don't know how long the drogue bastards will
give us."</p>

<p>After the big harvesting ships acknowledged, they dropped
like hawks after prey. What once had been a routine industrial process had
become a commando operation in a war zone.</p>

<p>When presented with the hydrogue threat, daring Roamer
engineers had redesigned traditional skymining facilities. They had
accomplished a lot in five years. The new blitzkrieg scoops had giant engines,
superefficient ekti reactors, and detachable cargo tanks like a cluster of
grapes. Once each tank was filled, it could be launched up to a retrieval
point, passing off the harvested ekti a bit at a time without losing a full
cargo load if&#151;<i>when</i>&#151;the hydrogues came after them.</p>

<p>Kellum transmitted, "The Big Goose thinks we're shiftless
bandits. By damn, let's give the drogues the same impression."</p>

<p>The Hansa&#151;the "Big Goose"&#151;paid dearly for every drop of
stardrive fuel. As ekti supplies dwindled year after year, prices skyrocketed
to a point that Roamers considered the risk acceptable.</p>

<p>Five of the modified scoops now dispersed across the
atmosphere, then plunged into Welyr's clouds, storm upwellings, and vanishingly
thin winds. With giant funnel-maws open, the blitzkrieg scoops roared through
storm systems at top speed. They gobbled resources, compressing the excess into
hydrogen-holding tanks while secondary ekti reactors processed the gas.</p>

<p>As he flew his lookout mission, like a man in the crow's
nest of an ancient pirate ship, Jess deployed floating sensors into Welyr's
soupy clouds. The buoys would detect any large ships rising from the depths.
The sensors might give only a few minutes' warning, but the daredevils could
retreat quickly enough.</p>

<p>Jess knew that it did no good to fight. The Ildiran Solar
Navy and the Hansa EDF had demonstrated that lesson often enough. At the first
sign of the enemy's arrival, his renegade harvesters would turn and run with
whatever ekti they'd managed to grab.</p>

<p>The first blitzkrieg scoop filled one cargo tank and rose
high enough to jettison it, leaving a smoke trail in the thin air. A resounding
cheer echoed across the comm, and the competitive Roamers challenged each other
to do better. The unmanned fuel tank soared away from Welyr toward its
rendezvous point. <i>Safe</i>.</p>

<p>In times past, leisurely skymines had drifted over the clouds
like whales feeding on plankton. Jess's brother, Ross, had been the chief of
Blue Sky Mine on Golgen; he'd had dreams, an excellent business sense, and all
the hopes in the world. Without warning, though, hydrogues had obliterated the
facility, killing every member of the crew....</p>

<p>Jess monitored his scans. Though the sinking sensor buoys
detected no turbulence that might signal the approach of the enemy, he didn't
let his attention waver. Welyr seemed much too quiet and peaceful. Deceptive.</p>

<p>Every crewman aboard the blitzkrieg scoops was tense,
knowing they had only one chance here, and that some of them would likely die
as soon as the hydrogues arrived.</p>

<p>"Here's a second one, highest-quality ekti!" Del Kellum's
harvester launched a full cargo tank. Within moments, each of the five
blitzkrieg scoops had ejected a load of ekti. The scavengers had been at Welyr
for less than three hours, and already it was a valuable haul.</p>

<p>"Good way to thumb our noses at the drogues," Kellum
continued, his anxiety manifesting as chattiness over the comm band, "though
I'd prefer to slam them with a few comets. Just like you did at Golgen, Jess."</p>

<p>Jess smiled grimly. His cometary bombardment had made him a
hero</p>

<p>among the Roamers, and he hoped that the planet was now
uninhabitable,</p>

<p>all the enemy aliens destroyed. A strike back. "I was just
following my Guiding</p>

<p>Star."</p>

<p>Now many clans looked to Jess for suggestions on how they
might continue their retaliation against the aliens' nonsensical prohibition.</p>

<p>"You and I have a lot in common," Kellum said, his voice
more conspiratorial now that he had switched to a private frequency. "And if
you ever do another bombardment, might I suggest this place as a target?"</p>

<p>"What have you got against Welyr?" Then he remembered. "Ah,
you were planning to marry Shareen of the Pasternak clan."</p>

<p>"Yes, by damn!" Shareen Pasternak had been the chief of a
skymine on Welyr. Jess recalled that the woman had an acidly sarcastic sense of
humor and a sharp tongue, but Kellum had been delighted with her. It would have
been the second marriage for both of them. But Shareen's skymine had been destroyed
in the early hydrogue depredations.</p>

<p>Now three more ekti cargo tanks launched away from the
racing blitzkrieg scoops.</p>

<p>Trish Ng, the pilot of a second lookout ship, frantically
radioed Jess, cutting off the conversation. "The sensor buoys! Check the
readings, Jess."</p>

<p>He saw a standard carrier wave with a tiny blip in the
background. "It's just a lightning strike. Don't get jumpy, Ng."</p>

<p>"That same lightning strike repeats every twenty-one
seconds. Like clockwork." She waited a beat. "Jess, it's an artificial signal,
copied, looped, and reflected back at us. The drogues must've already destroyed
the sensor buoys. It's a ruse."</p>

<p>Jess watched, and the pattern became apparent. "That's all
the warning we're going to get. Everybody, pack up and head out!"</p>

<p>As if realizing they had been discovered, seven immense
warglobes rose like murderous leviathans from Welyr's deep clouds. The Roamer
scavengers did not hesitate, retreating pell-mell up through the gas giant's
skies.</p>

<p>A deep-throated subsonic hum came from the alien spheres,
and pyramidal protrusions on their crystalline skins crackled with blue
lightning. The Roamer daredevils had all seen the enemy shoot their destructive
weapons before.</p>

<p>Kellum ejected four empty ekti cargo tanks, throwing them
like grapeshot at the nearest warglobes. "Choke on these!"</p>

<p>Jess shouted into the comm, "Don't wait. Just leave."</p>

<p>Kellum's diversion worked. The aliens targeted their blue lightning
on the empty projectiles, giving the blitzkrieg scoops a few more seconds to
escape. The Roamers fired their enormous engines, and four of the five
harvester scoops lifted on an escape trajectory.</p>

<p>But one of the new vessels hung behind just a moment too
long, and the enemy lightning bolts ripped the facility to molten shreds. The
crew's screams echoed across the comm channel, then cut off instantly.</p>

<p>"Go! Go!" Jess yelled. "Disperse and get out of here."</p>

<p>The remaining commando harvesters scattered like flies. The
automated cargo tanks would go to their pickup coordinates, where the commandos
could retrieve the haul at their leisure.</p>

<p>The warglobes rose up, shooting more blue lightning into
space. They struck and destroyed a lagging lookout ship, but the others
escaped. The enemy spheres remained above the atmosphere for some time, like
growling wolves, before they slowly descended back into the coppery storms of
Welyr, without pursuing.</p>

<p>Though dismayed at the loss of one blitzkrieg scoop and a
lookout ship, the raiders were already tallying the ekti they had harvested and
projecting how much it would bring on the open market.</p>

<p>Alone in the cockpit of his scout ship, Jess shook his head.
"What has happened to us, if we can cheer because our losses were 'not too
bad'?"
