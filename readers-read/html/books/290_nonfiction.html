 PROLOGUE </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 An hour before dawn on September 3, 1798, the
waves of the Mediterranean tugged at the coast of the island of San Pietro near
Sardinia, lullabying the thousand or so sleeping residents. So peaceful was it,
so rhythmic and hypnotic the sound�or perhaps it was due to a bottle of local
vino bianco�that even the two municipal watchmen in the church tower had fallen
asleep. So there was no one to puzzle out the faint white flecks of sails
growing larger on the pinkish gray horizon, and no one to ring the massive
church bells to sound the alarm that a fleet of seven ships was approaching.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Standing silently at the rail of these
lateen-sailed ships, visible in faint silhouette, were bearded men in loose
billowy pants and turbans, carrying scimitars and pistols. The vessels, packed
with one thousand Barbary Pirates from Tunis in North Africa, glided to anchor
inside the harbor. The crews quietly lowered small landing boats and began to
ferry men ashore. The first group, barefoot and heavily armed, raced to seal off
the two roads leading out of town.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Surprisingly, the leader of this attacking Moslem
fleet, the pirate commodore, as it were, was an Italian who had converted to
Islam. The ritual had involved losing his foreskin and gaining a new name. He
was now Mohammed Rumelli, and in the Lingua Franca slang of the Mediterranean,
he was dubbed a �rinigado,� a renegade. Over the centuries, the rulers of the
Barbary countries of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, , had learned that Christian
captains could navigate better than their homegrown Moslem talent. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">

 Another Italian, acting as harbor pilot, had
guided the fleet to the perfect anchorage. This fellow from Capri (never
identified by name) carried a deeply personal motive for joining the attack. He
had married a woman from San Pietro but she had abandoned him; he was now
convinced that she was cuckolding him here on the island. He had turned Turk
expressly to seek his revenge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 As the first ray of dawn caught the sails,
Muhammed Rumelli gave the signal to �wake up� the townspeople. The pirates
unleashed a sudden unholy thunder. The ships� cannons bellowed out broadsides.
The sailors on shore added a lunatic�s drum roll of small arms fire. The
cacaphony climaxed as close to a thousand mouths let loose impassioned Arabic
war cries and the men rushed into the town. <i>Allahu akhbar</i> speeded their
pursuit of profit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The corsairs engulfed the tiny town; they
battered down the doors, burst into homes, brandishing torches and scimitars,
rousting the stunned citizens from bed and kicking them into the streets. They
cursed their victims as <i>Romo Kelb</i> (�Christian dogs�). The women cowered
in corners, trying to avoid what one observer described as �shame and
villainies.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 A French naval officer, arriving the next day,
found that five women had died in&nbsp; their beds of knife wounds, their bodies
entwined in sheets caked with blood. The first female victim, according to local
accounts, was the unfaithful wife of that pilot from Capri. A Sardinian
historian later called her a �fishwife Helen� who had no idea that her husband�s
jealous rage had drawn the enemy to her homeland.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The attackers spent the entire day hauling money,
jewels, church silver, silks to the harbor but by far the most valuable
commodity to be stolen walked on two legs: human slaves. Surah 47 of the Koran
allowed these Moslem attackers to enslave and ransom any of these captives.
Young Italian women would fetch more than the men in the flesh markets of Tunis
and Algiers. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The crews dragged the townspeople aboard various
ships, tossing them like ballast willy-nilly belowdeck into the holds for the
160-mile voyage. The prisoners wore only what they had slipped into at bedtime
on that seemingly unimportant September night, which would turn out to be their
last night of freedom for half a decade. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 This was life on a Mediterranean island, circa
1798, in the age of Napoleon and&nbsp; Nelson and the waning days of the Barbary
Corsairs.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The Bey of Tunis, the country�s ruler, had
commissioned these seven ships and a thousand men to attack San Pietro. To the
Bey, they were his privateers, fighting a legitimate war against Sardinia which
had refused to pay tribute to him for the right to navigate the Mediterranean;
to the rest of the world, these seven ships were Barbary Pirates, part of a
centuries-old extortion scheme.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 Fall weather on the Mediterranean can run
skittish and storm winds kicked up. The San Pietro prisoners spent the next four
days seesawing in the windowless foul-smelling dark, appalled at their fate,
vomiting, weeping, with no sanitation, and almost no food or water. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 That is, all except six young women. �<i>Six
jeunes filles</i>,� ran a later report in French from a Dutch consul, Antoine
Nyssen, in Tunis. �Six young girls, alas, that they were still so, were selected
by the Rais (captains) to serve their filthy desires, and the most disgusting
forms of volupte� were their pasttimes during the voyage.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The ships, nearing Tunis, passed the site of
ancient Carthage, and the captains fired off celebratory cannon shots to signal
their victory. The city of Tunis lies six miles inland from the harbor,
connected by a stagnant reddish-colored lake. The pirates rushed the prisoners
aboard small barges; boatmen, pushing poles, then strained to follow a winding
route indicated by pillars rising a foot or two above the surface. �On these
pillars, standing silent, sad, wings furled, seeming like those birds sculpted
on tombs, are cormorants,� wrote French novelist, Alexander Dumas, who fifty
years later took this same route. Dumas said the birds of prey would suddenly
swoop down on some fish swimming near the surface, then calmly return to
re-assume their crypt-like pose. It�s doubtful that many of the Italian captives
noticed the wildlife.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The city soon announced itself by smell as much
as by sight. The prisoners later learned that fecal ditches run along the
northern and eastern walls to receive the human waste from 300,000 inhabitants
of various races: Moors, Arabs, Turks, Jews, European merchants and diplomats,
African and Christian slaves. Runoff from the ditches feed into the stagnant
shallow lake making the fish poisonous to humans but edible by the likes of
cormorants, flamingos and seagulls.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The corsairs, swinging leather straps, herded the
filthy exhausted prisoners through the narrow byways of the whitewashed city on
the unusually hot day of September 8, 1798. �I saw them harassed by blows, by
fatigue, covered in dust and dying of thirst, dragging themselves along a
burning street, barefoot, hatless,� wrote the Dutch consul. �There was a huge
crowd drunk with joy to see so many Christian victims of the <i>bravery </i>of
their soldiers.� </font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">

 These unfortunate captives staggered forward two
hours to the palace where the Bey of Tunis, Hamouda, in his jeweled turban and
diamond-encrusted silk vest, inspected them. For him it was like counting money.
Each of the prisoners was now a slave to be sold at his whim. The Bey�s corsairs
had captured an astounding 950 people, including 702 women and children. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 On the northern coast of Africa circa 1800,
blacks and<i> </i>whites could still be sold into slavery.&nbsp; Men were usually
peddled near naked, or in dangly shirts, in an outdoor auction; women could be
inspected privately in stalls nearby. Unlike slave auctions in the southern
United States, male buyers here openly acknowledged lustful desires for their
human purchases; matrons inspected the women, and virgins were sold at a steep
premium, often with a written guarantee.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 Of all the fears of people living in the 1780s
and 1790s, a fear perhaps exceeding death itself was the terror of being made a
slave on the Barbary Coast; in sermon after sermon, it was portrayed as Hell in
life. (Twenty-one free-born Americans had spent eleven years in slavery in
Algiers from 1785 to 1796, bringing their stories home to the nation.) </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 Foreign consuls begged the Bey not to break up
the San Pietro families, not to sell anyone off to Algerian slave traders. The
ruler of Tunis set his opening asking price for the women at 600 Venetian
Sequins each, about $1,371 at a time when a U.S. sailor earned $144 a year. He
would charge half that amount for the men. The Bey, to save on the costs of
feeding and dressing, then farmed many of the captives out to the leading
citizens of Tunis, including the representatives of foreign countries who
accepted the slaves on humanitarian grounds. (Six years later, Tobias Lear,
United States consul-general&nbsp; to Algiers, would accept two female Italian slaves
to work as housekeepers in the consulate. He would expense-account their
$75-a-year upkeep.)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Among the San Pietro prisoners, one young girl
stood out. Strikingly beautiful and of aristocratic birth, Anna Maria Porcile
was 12 years old, a ripe age on the Barbary Coast, a marriageable age. She was
the grand daughter of the Count of Sant-Antioco, the admiral of the Navy of
Sardinia. Brought up in a strict Catholic household, Anna had led a sheltered
life; private tutors taught music, literature and dance to this naturally
vivacious girl. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The Bey, to keep loyalty high among his officers,
decided to allow his six corsair captains to select one female each as his own
personal slave. The Admiral of the fleet, Rais Muhammed Rumelli, chose Anna.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Rumelli was quoted as saying he �had fixed his
desire on her�; he intended her as his concubine unless someone would
immediately buy her from him for the record asking price of 16,000 piasters, or
almost $5,000 (the price of a mansion in Manhattan). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Anna�s entire family had been captured in the
raid, including her mother Barbara, her father Antonio and her two sisters.
While the negotiations for the rest of the slaves could drag on over months via
shipboard messages to and from Sardinia, Anna�s fate must be decided quickly.
Rumelli demanded an answer. Anna�s father desperately tried to find financing.
He naturally turned to fellow Italians who happened to be in Tunis and he
fortunately found a Tuscan merchant, one Felipe Borzoni, who would loan him the
entire sum. The man paid Rais Rumelli and Anna was suddenly free� almost.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 She was the human collateral for her father�s
loan� the Bey would not grant a <i>tiskara</i> or passport to her until the loan
was repaid. With Anna as hostage for her father�s return, Don Antonio Porcile
was allowed to travel to Europe to raise the money but in the chaos of the
Napoleonic Wars, he failed. So the Tuscan merchant sold the debt to the aged
prime minister Mustapha Coggia, a man known for his wisdom, courtliness and a&nbsp;

complete lack of teeth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The months of 1799 slipped by, and these
white-skinned slaves joined the 2,000 or so slaves of various hues laboring in
Tunis. Negotiations dragged on� the price for the women dropped in half to 300
Venetian sequins� the exasperated Bey, to encourage a speedier payment, sold
eleven to slave traders of Algiers; nonetheless, the king of Sardinia, harassed
by Napoleon, was unable to redeem his countrymen. Italian slave mothers gave
birth to dozens of new slaves in Tunis.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 On Oct. 10, 1800, 87 year old Mustapha Coggia�who
held the Porcile debt�died, and all the prime minister�s possessions passed to
the Bey of Tunis. The very next day, the Bey demanded that the Porcile family
pay off the debt immediately or else the Bey said he would reclaim lovely Anna
and add her to his seraglio. Or, more ominously, he said he might instead
auction her off in the slave markets of Istanbul. (Since the Bey made little
secret of his preference for men over women�his foreign minister Yussef Sapatapa,
a 33 year old former slave, was his lover�selling Anna was the likelier
scenario.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 That afternoon, Anna and her mother and her
sister tried desperately to figure out a way to raise the money. Her
grandfather, the admiral, had died and her father, the new count, was at that
moment in Sardinia, still trying to amass the huge sum with absolutely no
success. The pirates had stolen everything. His credit was suspect. European
banking was a mess. The mother and her daughters were running out of options and
time� they considered the various consulates, such as British, French, Danish,
and the Catholic Redemptionist charities, Jewish moneylenders, European
merchants. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 On that afternoon of October 11, 1800, frantic,
they presented themselves at the door of the consulate of the United States of
America, a fledgling nation that trumpeted itself as a bastion of freedom; they
sought refuge under the red-white-and-blue flag which then had 15 stars and 15
stripes and was represented in Tunis by one of the most unlikely diplomats ever
to be forgotten by history: William Eaton.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 A former Army captain, Eaton had recently been
court-martialed and convicted. He was impetuous, hard-headed, argumentative. His
loud voice cut through conversations; his ramrod straight stance inspired
respect; his Dartmouth education added polysyllables to his vocabulary.
Diplomacy, he had very little, he was blunt-spoken, exceedingly direct. He once
wrote of the feeble efforts of the U.S. Navy that �a fleet of Quaker meeting
houses would have done just as well.� This bulldog of a man, age 35, stood 5�8�,
with deep set large blue eyes. A friend described his eyes as �expressive of
energy, penetration and authority� but also of �impatience and disquietude.�</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 Eaton had arrived in Tunis on the little merchant
brig <i>Sophia</i> in 1799 and was immediately appalled. �Here I am,� under the
mad rays of a vertical sun reflected and refracted from wall and terraces of
white-washed houses, hotter than tobacco &amp; rum, with plague and scorpions
suspended over my head, menacing death, surrounded by brutal Turks, swindlers,
jews, perfidious Italians, miserable slaves, lazy camels, churlish mules, and
savage arabs --- without society and without amusement. Is not this enough to
constitute a hell?�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 His irritation only grew, as he observed slavery
close up. �For my part, it grates me mortally when I see a lazy Turk [a Moslem]
reclining at his ease upon an embroidered sofa, with one Christian slave to fan
away the flies, another to hand him his coffee and a third to hold his pipe�. It
is still more grating to perceive that the Turk believes he has a right to
demand this contribution and that we, like Italians, have not the fortitude to
resist it.� (The United States government, with a huge debt from the
Revolutionary War, found it cheaper to pay off Tunis--and keep the pirates
away--than to fight against them.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Eaton, a New England patriot, was appalled that
the United States would pay bribes to pirates, and was deeply annoyed at having
personally to hand out diamond-encrusted watches, gold watches, pairs of
gold-mounted pistols, gold tobacco boxes, silks, and many others items to sixty
different government officials in Tunis from the Bey and Admiral down to the
infamously ugly eunuch who guarded the Bey�s harem, the dark-skinned giant with
the raspy meuling infant�s voice. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 The Porcile women stood crying before William
Eaton. Anna�s honor hung in the balance. �Imagination better than language can
paint their distress,� Eaton later wrote. From a conviction about freedom that
literally had its roots near Plymouth Rock with Eaton�s great great grandfather,
he could not abide this form of persecution.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Against all common sense, Eaton agreed to
guarantee a six month loan for Anna�s father, allowing himself to stand as
surety for the repayment of $5,000. �I ransomed your daughter,� Eaton later
wrote to the Count, �because being in my house, both the honor of my flag and my
own sensibility dictated it.� If at the end of six months Count Porcile couldn�t
pay, then Eaton was obligated to do so.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 What is striking is that Eaton at that moment had
absolutely no money. At least, none of his own, and yet, he was committing to
pay a small fortune to rescue an Italian slave girl. Impetuously. For Honor.
William Eaton, throughout his life, would be drawn to commit deeds that he
considered righteous and others would consider reckless. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 His flurry of letters to Count Porcile received
eloquent replies but no money. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 And in June of 1801, the homosexual lover of the
Bey, Yussef Sapatapa, told Eaton that he must repay the $5,000. Eaton, after
failing to raise money through trading ventures, was now forced to borrow the
large sum from a Tunisian merchant, named Unis ben Unis. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 In February of 1803, to show some force and fend
off any threat of war, the United States sent armed ships to Tunis. An old
Barbary maxim states: �Whoever acts like a sheep, the wolf will eat.� So, the
young United States did not want to be mistaken for a sheep. Commodore Richard
Morris, with Captain John Rodgers, arrived in three heavily armed frigates. The
mission seemed successful; the odd new nation across the Atlantic did indeed
have a navy. But as Commodore Morris, in blue uniform with gold epaulettes, was
about to embark to cross that stagnant lake to go to the harbor, he was suddenly
arrested� because of the thousands of dollars of debt of William Eaton. The
highest ranking United States Navy officer found himself surrounded by&nbsp;
Tunisians wielding scimitars and he was forced to return to the city. �It was
impossible to apprehend that the respect attached to the person of the Commodore
would be violated,� Eaton wrote. �It is unprecedented, even in the history of
Barbary outrage.�</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Commodore Richard Morris�a scion of the wealthy
Morris family of Vermont, whose brother had cast the deciding ballot to elect
Jefferson over Burr--was furious with Eaton. He assumed that the man�s debts
were mostly personal. Eaton, Morris and Unis ben Unis walked to the palace where
Bey Hamouda, wearing a jeweled silk cloak, greeted them on his luxurious sofa.
Eaton vehemently denied that he had ever promised to repay Unis ben Unis
whenever the American squadron arrived. Unis demanded payment of $22,000� of
that, $5,000 came from Eaton�s ransom of Anna and $10,000 came from Sapatapa
claiming that Eaton had&nbsp; promised him a large bribe and the remaining $7,000
from a commercial dispute. Eaton snapped. He called the Bey�s lover, the prime
minister, a �thief� to his face and said all he had experienced in Tunis was
�violence and indignity.� The Bey, unaccustomed to contre-temps, shouted over
and over that Eaton was mad. Eye-witnesses said that the Bey�s lip trembled and
he oddly clutched his mustache as he yelled: �I will turn you out of my
kingdom.� When the Bey had calmed down, he told the commodore: �The Consul is a
man of a good heart but a bad head. He is too obstinate and too violent for me.
I must have a consul with a disposition more congenial to the Barbary
interests.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commodore Morris had no appetite for remaining in Tunis, for
fighting for the loud-mouthed consul. He agreed to replace Eaton and to pay off
the $22,000. He later wrote �As security for the money paid by me, I insisted on
Mr. Eaton assigning all his real and personal estate to the government.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 On March 10, 1803, Eaton boarded the <i>U.S.
Chesapeake</i>. He was on the verge of ruin. Disgraced as a diplomat, he was
returning home to his wife; he was financially devastated. This last twist was
ironic since Eaton had accepted the post of consul to Tunis in the hopes that he
might make enough money to re-enter his marriage as the financial equal of
Eliza, a widow of a wealthy Revolutionary War general. �[I hope] the hour is not
far distant,� he had written to her before the disaster,&nbsp; �when I may
demonstrate to the world that it was not Mrs. Danielson�s fortune but her person
that <u>Captain Eaton</u> married.� </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height:200%">
 In his official report, Morris stated that
�[Eaton] appeared to be a man of lively imagination, rash, credulous. And by no
means possessed of sound judgement.� </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:200%" dir="rtl">
 *****</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 Within two years, this disgraced diplomat would
lead a band of eight marines, <i>eight</i>, and several hundred foreign
mercenaries, the dregs of Alexandria, on a mad hopeless mission to march across
the hell of the Libyan desert. He would try to finance the mission with the
funds owed to him for ransoming Anna, the Italian slave girl. Thomas Jefferson
would send Eaton on America�s first covert military op overseas, to try to
overthrow the government of Tripoli in order to free the <i>three hundred</i>
American sailors enslaved there. This man on the verge of personal ruin, joined
by his handful of marines including violin-playing Presley O�Bannon, would
surprise-attack Tripoli�s second largest city, and they would achieve a near
miraculous victory. He would help stamp the then second class service, the
United States Marines, with a new reputation for courage. His exploits would
lead future generations of Americans to sing proudly: �From the Halls of
Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country�s battles on the
land and on the sea.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 In 1805, in the first decades of our North
American experiment in democracy, when the nation�s future prosperity was very
much in doubt, William Eaton made one of the loudest statements to the world
that the United States was not a country to be mocked or bullied. While
politicians and military officers mouthed the same patriotic phrases, Eaton
risked his life to back up his statements. He helped set a national tone of
defiance and daring.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">
 But in William Eaton�s flinty outspokenness and
fearlessness, there lurked the seeds of his own destruction. Thomas Jefferson
could not abide the man�s relentless belligerence. The aftermath of victory in
Tripoli for Eaton would be less than sweet. After taking on Tripoli and the
Barbary pirates, he would challenge and defy Thomas Jefferson. It would be a
battle between unequals, and no good can come of that.
