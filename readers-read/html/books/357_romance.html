              <b>Chapter One</b>
<p>It was Jemma who called Melanie to say she couldn't awaken
  her parents that Sunday morning. Jemma, who had lived with the Hammond family
  for the first twenty years of her employ and, for the last twenty, loyally took
  the train up from the Bronx every morning and then a cab to their house in Purchase,
  New York. She did this every morning save an occasional Saturday and Sunday
  when there was a church function or one of her friends or neighbors needed her
  assistance but, what with the snowstorm, she decided to check when the Hammonds
  hadn't answered their phone. Besides, Jemma thought, it was about time she pulled
  up the artificial tree from the basement and started decorating. The girls were
  coming for Christmas this year and that was only the day after tomorrow. The
  girls, Jemma thought. Grace and Melanie were women now with children of their
  own, but to her they would always be the girls.</p>
<p>Jemma knew the moment she stepped out of the cab that
  the Hammonds' house was too quiet. Two newspapers, wrapped in plastic, were
  jammed into the newspaper box. The blinds in the upstairs bedroom window were
  still drawn. The lamp did not glow from the living room on that pale gray day.
  At first, Jemma hoped it was the soporific hush that snowfall causes on a lazy
  Sunday morning and that the Hammonds were uncharacteristically sleeping. She
  turned her key in the door and flipped on the light in the vestibule. She called
  out their names and poked her head into the living room and saw it was, indeed,
  darkened and untouched.</p>
<p>Usually, Jemma found them sitting side by side in the
  living room, wearing dark, plaid flannel robes in winter and white-piped pastel
  cotton robes in summer. They would say good morning and make small talk about
  the weather. Remind her of a task that needed to be done that Jemma knew to
  do anyway after forty years. Jemma would roll up the blinds and open a window
  if the weather was temperate. She would place Mrs. Hammond's copper kettle on
  for tea and lay out her place setting at the dining table with a crystal bowl
  of sugar cubes, a china teacup, matching plate of wheat toast, and a small jar
  of marmalade with a tiny gold spoon. Lately, she put the newspaper's television
  guide next to Mrs. Hammond's place setting and circled the movies and quiz shows
  in red. She would right Mr. Hammond's TV tray in front of the television: a
  bowl of Wheatena, a glass of tomato juice, a cup of Sanka with saccharine that
  he shook from a small silver envelope. He ate in silence, watching the Dow-Jones
  trail monotonously at the bottom of the screen. There was no conversation at
  breakfast. Ultimately, Mrs. Hammond would take her place next to her husband
  on the sofa. They would watch the game shows and wait for lunch. Sometimes they
  played gin rummy or Scrabble. But Mr. Hammond had trouble with games lately.
  He had difficulty distinguishing the suits when he played gin rummy with his
  wife. He became confused with clubs and spades, hearts and diamonds. The shapes
  and the colors baffled him. Scrabble was even more daunting. There were too
  many words he couldn't remember. He stared at the jumbled letter tiles in the
  rack before him, pushing them about with his finger and shaking his head from
  side to side, stuck on the words.</p>
<p>When the girls were children, Jemma often carried Mrs.
  Hammond's breakfast to her room. &quot;Your mama has a weak constitution,&quot;
  Jemma would explain as Grace and Melanie sat at the kitchen table eating their
  breakfast while their father hid behind the <i>Herald Tribune</i> drinking his
  Sanka. &quot;She needs her sugar in the morning. Now you girls eat and I'll
  be right back to get you on that bus.</p>
<p>&quot;It was easy for Grace and Melanie to believe Jemma.
  How could you not believe someone who wore shirtwaist dresses with gingham checks?
  Whose lips were polished with an amber gloss that looked like it might taste
  like apricot? Sometimes Jemma even painted her nails as well, a deep burgundy
  and, if the girls happened to be around when Jemma was doing what she called
  her beauty routine, she'd paint their nails as well. Jemma would sit the girls
  down at the kitchen table, their fingers dangling in bowls of soapy water. She'd
  push back their cuticles with an orange stick and file the tips into ovals.
  This is just like the salon, Jemma would say with the emphasis on <i>salon's</i>
  first syllable. And the girls would laugh and say that they felt fancy.</p>
<p>Once in a while their father would lower the paper that
  covered his face at breakfast and say something to his daughters. Something
  like, &quot;How are you girls this morning?&quot; or &quot;Make sure you kiss
  your mother good-bye.&quot; He tried, at the very least, for the pretense of
  intimacy, of family. Awkwardly, but he tried. Though he was visibly uncomfortable
  in his own skin, unable to extend even the smallest offering of warmth as though
  it might scald him or, perhaps, scald those around him.</p>
<p>Jemma walked hesitantly up the stairs that early Sunday
  morning. She walked slowly, not with the surprisingly brisk pace with which
  her sixty-four-year-old legs usually carried her. She opened the Hammonds' bedroom
  door tentatively with a still-gloved hand and knew from the moment she saw them,
  side by side, motionless and emotionless, that they were gone. She let go a
  cry and ran back down the stairs. The heel of her boot snagged on a piece of
  loose carpet, causing her to trip, and she righted herself with the aid of the
  banister. Her hands trembled so rapidly she could barely dial Melanie's number
  (it never occurred to her to call the police) and still, not believing what
  she saw, Jemma told Melanie she was unable to awaken her parents.</p>
<p>Melanie and her husband drove the twenty minutes from
  where they lived, leaving their three-year-old twin boys in the care of a neighbor
  who, as Melanie always said, was like a grandmother to them. When Melanie and
  Mike arrived at the house that Sunday morning after Jemma called, they parked
  their car behind the old black Buick in the driveway. It was apparent that the
  car had not been used in days. The roof was covered with a crusty layer of snow;
  the windows were iced over. Jemma was standing just inside the open front door.
  The pewter chandelier in the entryway shone dimly. Several of the candle bulbs
  had burned out, making the old gold-colored grass cloth on the walls appear
  even dingier. Jemma's purple-and-red paisley scarf was tied under her chin,
  her dull red parka buttoned up to her neck. She clutched her pocketbook as though,
  at any moment, she was prepared to leave. Powdered snow had blown into the entrance
  hall and dusted the tops of her boots. As Melanie and Mike approached her, Jemma
  stepped outside onto the stoop.</p>
<p>&quot;Jemma, you must be freezing, standing here with
  the door open like this,&quot; Melanie said, hugging her gently as if she might
  break.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to go back inside. Maybe we shouldn't
  go inside,&quot; Jemma said, her eyes darting one way and then the other. &quot;Maybe
  we should just let them sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay, Jemma,&quot; Mike said, glancing nervously
  at his wife. &quot;We're here now.&quot;</p>
<p>Melanie ushered Jemma back into the house and closed
  the heavy front door behind them. She started to call out hello and stopped,
  choking on the first syllable before the word could be completed. Despite Jemma's
  insistence that her parents were merely sleeping, Melanie knew there would be
  no answer. She knew when Jemma called that there would be no awakening. Melanie
  placed her coat over the banister, glanced at her father's old brown fedora
  hanging on the hook beside the mirror. She saw her mother's trench coat hanging
  next to her father's hat, her threadbare beige cashmere scarf tucked into the
  sleeve, the fringe dangling through the cuff. She turned the corner and stopped
  before the arched living room door. Jemma followed by Melanie's side, gripping
  Melanie's elbow tightly while Mike trailed a few steps behind them.</p>
<p>&quot;Are they in their bedroom?&quot; Melanie turned
  suddenly to Jemma, asking what she already knew.</p>
<p>&quot;They are. I can't wake them,&quot; she repeated.
  Jemma's face appeared frozen. She appeared to mouth the words almost grotesquely,
  in slow motion, when she spoke.</p>
<p>Melanie looked at Jemma intently. She saw the coarse
  curls of gray that sprouted around her temples, the dark circles beneath her
  eyes that were prematurely rheumy with age. Melanie took Jemma's hands in hers
  and saw the darkened age spots and reddened thickening around her knuckles as
  Jemma's hands slowly closed upon her own in what she perceived as both a gesture
  of desperation and confidence. For a moment, Melanie pictured Jemma's fine-boned
  face as a young woman, her creamy mocha skin, her once jet-black hair sleeked
  into a bun at the nape of her neck. Her delicate fingers that nimbly threaded
  needles, sewed on buttons, hemmed skirts, braided hair.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be okay, Jemma,&quot; Melanie said
  in a way that begged for Jemma's assurance, but Jemma only blinked back tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Mel, maybe you and Jemma should wait in the car
  and let me . . .,&quot; Mike said, but Melanie clearly didn't hear him and he
  stopped speaking halfway through his sentence.</p>
<p>Melanie started up the stairs, stopped halfway, and came
  back down. She picked up the phone on the table by the stairwell.</p>
<p>&quot;Melanie, who are you calling?&quot; asked Jemma.</p>
<p>&quot;The police,&quot; Melanie said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, why?&quot; Jemma almost pleaded. &quot;Why
  should you --?&quot;</p>
<p>Melanie interrupted her as the police answered. &quot;We
  have a problem at Thirty-two Harvest Lane,&quot; she said. &quot;Can you send
  a car?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What seems to be the problem?&quot; the voice asked
  on the other end.</p>
<p>&quot;I think my parents might be dead,&quot; said Melanie.</p>
<p>Jemma gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. &quot;Melanie!&quot;
  she cried. &quot;Melanie! All I said was I couldn't wake them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus, Mel,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Jesus. It's
  all right, Jemma.&quot; His arm was slung around Jemma's shoulder now, enveloping
  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Their, um, housekeeper found them this morning,&quot;
  Melanie continued, raising her hand, wrist bent back, fingers spread tensely,
  to silence her husband and Jemma as she spoke. &quot;She says she couldn't wake
  them up.&quot; And then, &quot;No, I haven't seen them yet. Yes, the house is
  intact. No, my husband is with us. There is no evidence of a break-in. Yes,
  we'll wait outside.&quot;</p>
