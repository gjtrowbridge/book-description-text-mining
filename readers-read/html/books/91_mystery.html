<h4 align="center">Behind the Eight Ball</h4>

<p><small>JULY 24, 4:34 A.M.<br />
FREDERICK, MARYLAND</small></p>

<p>The saboteur had arrived.</p>

<p>Grayson Pierce edged his motorcycle between the dark buildings that
made up the heart of Fort Detrick. He kept the bike idling. Its electric engine
purred no louder than a refrigerator's motor. The black gloves he wore
matched the bike's paint, a nickel-phosphorous compound called NPL
Super Black. It absorbed more visible light, making ordinary black seem
positively shiny. His cloth body suit and rigid helmet were equally shaded.</p>

<p>Hunched over the bike, he neared the end of the alley. A courtyard
opened ahead, a dark chasm framed by the brick-and-mortar buildings
that composed the National Cancer Institute, an adjunct to USAMRIID,
the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Here
the country's war on bioterrorism was waged across sixty thousand
square feet of maximum-containment labs.</p>

<p>Gray cut the engine but stayed seated. His left knee rested against the
satchel. It held the seventy thousand dollars. He remained in the alley,
avoiding the open courtyard. He preferred the dark. The moon had long
set, and the sun would not rise for another twenty-two minutes. Even the
stars remained clouded by the shredding tail of last night's summer storm.</p>

<p>Would his ruse hold?</p>

<p>He subvocalized into his throat mike. "Mule to Eagle, I've reached the
rendezvous. Proceeding on foot."</p>

<p>"Roger that. We've got you on satellite."</p>

<p>Gray resisted the urge to look up and wave. He hated to be watched,
scrutinized, but the deal here was too big. He did manage to gain a concession:
to take the meeting alone. His contact was skittish. It had taken
six months to groom this contact, brokering connections in Libya and the
Sudan. It hadn't been easy. Money did not buy much trust. Especially in
this business.</p>

<p>He reached down to the satchel and shouldered the money bag. Wary,
he walked his bike over to a shadowed alcove, parked it, and hooked a leg
over the seat.</p>

<p>He crossed down the alley.</p>

<p>There were few eyes awake at this hour, and most of those were only
electronic. All of his identification had passed inspection at the Old Farm
Gate, the service entrance to the base. And now he had to trust that his
subterfuge held out long enough to evade electronic surveillance.</p>

<p>He glanced to the glowing dial on his Breitling diver's watch: 4:45. The
meeting was set for fifteen minutes from now. So much depended on his
success here.</p>

<p>Gray reached his destination. Building 470. It was deserted at this
hour, due for demolition next month. Poorly secured, the building was
perfect for the rendezvous, yet the choice of venue was also oddly ironic.
In the sixties, spores of anthrax had been brewed inside the building, in
giant vats and tanks, fermenting strains of bacterial death, until the toxic
brewery had been decommissioned back in 1971. Since then, the building
had been left fallow, becoming a giant storage closet for the National
Cancer Institute.</p>

<p>But once again, the business of anthrax would be conducted under
this roof. He glanced up. The windows were all dark. He was to meet the
seller on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Reaching the side door, he swiped the lock with an electronic keycard
supplied by his contact at the base. He carried the second half of the
man's payment over his shoulder, having wired the first half a month
before. Gray also bore a foot-long plastic, carbonized dagger in a concealed
wrist sheath.</p>

<p>His only weapon.</p>

<p>He couldn't risk bringing anything else through the security gate.</p>

<p>Gray closed the door and crossed to the stairwell on the right. The
only light on the stairs came from the red EXIT sign. He reached to his
motorcycle helmet and toggled on the night-vision mode. The world
brightened in tones of green and silver. He mounted the stairs and
climbed quickly to the fourth floor.</p>

<p>At the top, he pushed through the landing's door.</p>

<p>He had no idea where he was supposed to meet his contact. Only that
he was to await the man's signal. He paused for a breath at the door, surveying
the space before him. He didn't like it.</p>

<p>The stairwell opened at the corner of the building. One corridor
stretched straight ahead; the other ran to the left. Frosted glass office
doors lined the inner walls; windows slitted the other. He proceeded directly
ahead at a slow pace, alert for any sign of movement.</p>

<p>A flood of light swept through one of the windows, washing over him.</p>

<p>Dazzled through his night-vision, he rolled against one wall, back into
darkness. Had he been spotted? The sweep of light pierced the other
windows, one after the other, passing down the hall ahead of him.
Leaning out, he peered through one of the windows. It faced the wide
courtyard that fronted the building. Across the way, he watched a
Humvee trundle slowly down the street. Its searchlight swept through
the courtyard.</p>

<p>A patrol.</p>

<p>Would the attention spook his contact?</p>

<p>Cursing silently, Gray waited for the truck to finish its round. The patrol
vanished momentarily, crossing behind a hulking structure that rose
from the middle of the courtyard below. It looked like some rusting
spaceship, but was in fact a million-liter steel containment sphere, three
stories tall, mounted on a dozen pedestal legs. Ladders and scaffolding
surrounded the structure as it underwent a renovation, an attempt to return
it to its former glory when it was a Cold War research facility. Even
the steel catwalk that had once circumnavigated the globe's equator had
been replaced.</p>

<p>Gray knew the giant globe's nickname at the base.</p>

<p>The Eight Ball.</p>
