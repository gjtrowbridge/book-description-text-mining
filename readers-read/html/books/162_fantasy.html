CHAPTER
            1<BR><BR>The Imperial Star Destroyer moved silently through the
            blackness of space, its lights dimmed, its huge sublight engines
            blazing with the urgency of its mission.<BR><BR>The man standing on
            the command walkway could feel the rumble of those engines through
            his boots as he listened to the muttered conversation from the crew
            pits below him. The conversation sounded worried, too, as worried as
            he himself felt.<BR><BR>Though for entirely different reasons. For
            him, this was a personal matter, the frustration of a professional
            dealing with fallible beings and the capriciousness of a universe
            that refused to always live up to one�s preconceived notions as to
            what was fitting and proper. An error had been made, possibly a very
            serious error. And as with all errors, there would likely be
            unpleasant consequences riding in its wake.<BR><BR>From the
            starboard crew pit came a muffled curse, and he stifled a grimace.
            None of that mattered to the Star Destroyer�s crew. Their worries
            stemmed solely from their performance, and whether they would be
            facing a pat on the back or a boot in the rear at journey�s
            end.<BR><BR>Or possibly they were merely worried about the sublight
            engines blowing up. On this ship, one never knew.<BR><BR>He shifted
            his attention downward, his gaze leaving the grandeur of the
            starscape and coming to rest on the bow of the Star Destroyer
            stretching out more than a kilometer in front of him. He could
            remember the days when the mere sight of one of these ships would
            send shivers up the spines of the bravest of fighters and the most
            arrogant of smugglers.<BR><BR>But those days were gone, hopefully
            forever. The Empire had been rehabilitated, though of course many
            within the New Republic still refused to believe that. Under Supreme
            Commander Pellaeon�s firm guidance, the Empire had signed a treaty
            with the New Republic, and was no longer any more threatening than
            the Bothans or the Corporate Sector or anyone else.<BR><BR>Almost
            unwillingly, he smiled as he gazed along the Star Destroyer�s long
            prow. Of course, even in the old days of the Empire, this particular
            ship would probably have inspired more bewilderment than
            fear.<BR><BR>It was, after all, hard to take a bright red Star
            Destroyer very seriously.<BR><BR>From behind him, audible even over
            the rumble of the engines, came the sound of clumping boots. �Okay,
            Karrde,� Booster Terrik grunted as he came to a halt at his side.
            �The comm�s finally fixed. You can transmit whenever you
            want.�<BR><BR>�Thank you,� Talon Karrde said, turning back toward
            the crew pits and trying hard not to blame Booster for the state his
            equipment was in. An Imperial Star Destroyer was a huge amount of
            ship to take care of, and Booster never had nearly enough personnel
            to do the job right. �H�sishi?� he called. �Go.�<BR><BR>[Yes,
            Chieftain,] the Togorian called back from the comm board, her fur
            fluffing slightly as her clawed fingers touched the keys.
            [Transmission complete. Shall I begin alerting the rest of the
            network now?]<BR><BR>�Yes,� Karrde said. �Thank you.�<BR><BR>H�sishi
            nodded and returned her attention to the board.<BR><BR>With that,
            Karrde knew, he�d done all he could for the moment. Turning again to
            face the stars, he folded his arms across his chest and tried hard
            to cultivate his patience. �It�ll be all right,� Booster murmured
            from beside him. �We�ll be around this star in half an hour and be
            able to jump to lightspeed. We can be in the Domgrin system in two
            standard days, tops.�<BR><BR>�Assuming the hyperdrive doesn�t break
            down again.� Karrde waved a hand. �Sorry. I�m just�you
            understand.�<BR><BR>�Sure,� Booster said. �But relax, all right?
            This is Luke and Mara we�re talking about, not some fresh-hatched
            Neimoidian grubs. Whatever�s going on, they�re not going to be
            caught flat-footed.�<BR><BR>�Maybe,� Karrde said. �Though even Jedi
            can be surprised.� He shook his head. �But that�s not the point, is
            it? The point is that I messed up. I don�t like it when that
            happens.�<BR><BR>Booster shrugged his massive shoulders. �Like any
            of the rest of us do?� he asked pointedly. �You have to face the
            facts, Karrde, and Fact Number One is that you simply can�t know
            everyone who works for you anymore.�<BR><BR>Karrde glared out at the
            mockingly cheerful red ship stretched out in front of him. But
            Booster was right. This whole thing had gotten completely out of
            hand.<BR><BR>He�d started out modestly enough, merely offering to
            provide timely information to the leaders of the New Republic and
            Empire so that both sides could be assured that the other wasn�t
            plotting against them. And for the first couple of years everything
            had gone just fine.<BR><BR>The trouble had come when the various
            planetary and sector governments within the New Republic had woken
            up to the benefits of this handy service and decided they wanted
            aboard, too. After the near civil war that had broken out over the
            Caamas Document, Karrde hadn�t really felt like turning them down,
            and with permission from his clients on Coruscant and Bastion he�d
            gone ahead and expanded his operations.<BR><BR>Which naturally meant
            expanding his personnel as well. In retrospect, he supposed, it had
            only been a matter of time before something like this happened. He
            just wished it hadn�t happened to Luke and Mara. �Maybe not,� he
            told Booster. �But even if I can�t handle everything personally,
            it�s still my responsibility.�<BR><BR>�Ah,� Booster said knowingly.
            �So it�s your pride that�s hurt, is it?�<BR><BR>Karrde eyed his old
            friend. �Tell me, Booster. Has anyone ever told you you�re truly
            irritating when you try to be sympathetic?�<BR><BR>�Yeah, the
            subject�s come up once or twice,� Booster said, grinning. He slapped
            Karrde�s back. �Come on. Let�s go down to the Transis Corridor and
            I�ll buy you a drink.�<BR><BR>�Assuming the drink dispensers are
            working today,� Karrde murmured as they headed back along the
            command walkway.<BR><BR>�Well, yeah,� Booster conceded. �Always
            assuming that.� ...<BR><BR>As cantinas went, Mara Jade Skywalker
            thought as she sipped her drink, this was definitely one of the
            strangest she�d ever been in.<BR><BR>Part of that might simply have
            been due to the locale. Here in the Outer Rim, culture and style
            weren�t exactly up to the standards of Coruscant and the rest of the
            Core Worlds. That might explain the gaudy wall hangings juxtaposed
            with ancient plumbing woven around modern drink dispensers, all of
            it set against a background decor consisting mainly of polished
            droid parts dating back to before the Clone Wars.<BR><BR>As for the
            unbreakable mugs and the heavy, stone-topped table she was seated
            at, the smoothed-over blaster scars in the walls and ceiling were
            more than enough explanation. When the patrons dived under the
            tables in the middle of a firefight, they would want those tables to
            afford them some protection. And they wouldn�t want to find
            themselves sitting on bits of broken crockery, either.<BR><BR>There
            was no rationale at all, of course, for the very loud, very off-key
            music.<BR><BR>A brush of air touched her shoulder, and a heavyset
            man appeared from behind her, pushing his way through the milling
            crowd. �Sorry,� he huffed as he circled the table and landed his
            bulk back in the seat across from her. �Business, business,
            business. Never lets up for a minute.�<BR><BR>�I suppose not,� Mara
            agreed. He didn�t fool her for a second; even without Force
            sensitivity she would have spotted the furtiveness hidden behind the
            noise and bustle. Jerf Huxley, master smuggler and minor terror of
            the Outer Rim, was up to something unpleasant.<BR><BR>The only
            question was how unpleasant he was planning for that something to
            be.<BR><BR>�Yeah, it�s crazy out here,� Huxley went on, taking a
            noisy swallow of the drink he�d left behind when he hurried off on
            the mysterious errand that had taken him away from their table. �
            �Course, you know all that. Or at least you used to.� He eyed her
            over the rim of his mug. �What�s so funny?�<BR><BR>�Oh, nothing,�
            Mara said, not bothering to erase the smile that had caught the
            other�s attention. �I was just thinking about what a trusting person
            you are.�<BR><BR>�What do you mean?� he asked,
            frowning.<BR><BR>�Your drink,� Mara said, gesturing to his mug. �You
            go away and leave it alone with me, and then you just come back and
            toss it down without even wondering if I�ve put something in
            it.�<BR><BR>Huxley�s lips puckered, and through the Force Mara
            caught a hint of his chagrin. He hadn�t worried about his drink, of
            course, because he�d had her under close surveillance the whole time
            he was gone. He also hadn�t intended for her to know that. �All
            right, fine,� he said, banging the mug back onto the table. �Enough
            with the games. Let�s hear it. Why are you here?�<BR><BR>With a man
            like this, Mara knew, there was no point in glaze- coating it. �I�m
            here on behalf of Talon Karrde,� she said. �He wanted me to thank
            you for your assistance and that of your organization over the past
            ten years, and to inform you that your services will no longer be
            required.�<BR><BR>Huxley�s face didn�t even twitch. Clearly, he�d
            already suspected this was coming. �Starting when?� he
            asked.<BR><BR>�Starting now,� Mara said. �Thanks for the drink, and
            I�ll be on my way.�<BR><BR>�Not so fast,� Huxley said, lifting a
            hand.<BR><BR>Mara froze halfway to her feet. Behind Huxley, blasters
            had abruptly appeared in the hands of three of the men who had
            hitherto been minding their own business at the bar. Blasters that
            were, not surprisingly, pointed at her. �Sit down,� he ordered.
            Carefully, Mara eased back into her chair. �Was there something
            else?� she asked mildly.<BR><BR>Huxley gestured again, more
            emphatically this time, and the off-key background music shut off.
            As did all conversation. �So that�s it, is it?� Huxley demanded
            quietly. In the sudden silence, even a soft voice seemed to ring
            against the battered walls. �Karrde�s going to toss us aside, just
            like that?�<BR><BR>�I presume you read the news,� Mara said, keeping
            her voice calm. All around her, she could sense the single-minded
            animosity of the crowd. Huxley had apparently stocked the place with
            his friends and associates. �Karrde�s getting out of the smuggling
            business. Has been, for the past three years. He doesn�t need your
            services anymore.�<BR><BR>�Yeah, he doesn�t need,� Huxley said with
            a sniff. �What about what we need?�<BR><BR>�I don�t know,� Mara
            said. �What do you need?�<BR><BR>�Maybe you don�t remember what it�s
            like in the Outer Rim, Jade,� Huxley said, leaning over the table
            toward her. �But out here, you don�t split things three ways against
            the ends. You work for one group, period, or you don�t work at all.
            We burned our skyarches behind us years ago when we started working
            for Karrde. If he pulls out, what are we supposed to do?�<BR><BR>�I
            expect you�ll have to make new arrangements,� Mara said. �Look, you
            had to have known this was coming. Karrde�s made no secret of the
            direction he�s been taking.�<BR><BR>�Yeah, right,� Huxley said
            contemptuously. �Like anyone believed he�d really go
            straight.�<BR><BR>He drew himself up. �So you want to know what we
            need? Fine. What we need is something to tide us over until we can
            get back in the business with someone else.�<BR><BR>So there it was:
            a simple and straightforward pocket-shake. Nothing subtle from this
            bunch. �How much?� she asked.<BR><BR>�Five hundred thousand.� His
            lip twisted slightly. �In cash credits.�<BR><BR>Mara kept her face
            expressionless. She�d come here prepared for something like this,
            but that number was way beyond reason. �And where exactly do you
            expect me to get this little tide-me-over?� she asked. �I don�t
            carry that much spending money on me.�<BR><BR>�Don�t get cute,�
            Huxley growled. �You know as well as I do that Karrde�s got a sector
            clearinghouse over on Gonmore. They�ll have all the credits there we
            need.�<BR><BR>He dug into a pocket and produced a hold-out blaster.
            �You�re going to call and tell them to bring it to us,� he said,
            leveling the weapon at her face across the table. �Half a million.
            Now.�<BR><BR>�Really.� Casually, keeping her hands visible, Mara
            turned her head to look behind her. Most of the cantina�s
            nonsmuggler patrons had already made a quiet exit, she noted, or
            else had gathered into groups on either side of the confrontation,
            staying well out of the potential lines of fire. Of more immediate
            concern was the group of about twenty humans and aliens who had
            spread themselves out in a semicircle directly behind her, all of
            them with weapons trained on her back.<BR><BR>All of them also
            showing varying degrees of wariness, she noted with a certain
            malicious amusement. Her reputation had apparently preceded her.
            �You throw an interesting party, Huxley,� she said, turning back to
            face the smuggler chief. �But you don�t really think you�re equipped
            to deal with a Jedi, do you?�<BR><BR>Huxley smiled. A very evil
