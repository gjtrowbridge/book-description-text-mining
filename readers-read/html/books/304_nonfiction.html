<p><h3>Preface</h3></p>

<p>Why another Kennedy book? I
was asked repeatedly during the five years I worked on this biography. The
availability of new materials &#151; written contemporary documents, telephone and
Oval Office tapes, and entire oral histories or parts thereof &#151; seemed ample
reason to revisit Kennedy's personal and public lives. I also took guidance from
science writer Jacob Bronowski: "Ask an impertinent question and you are on
your way to a pertinent answer." As I worked my way through the records, I was
startled by how many fresh things could be said based on the combination of old
and new files about the man, his family, and his political career. To cite just
a few examples, new documents reveal more clearly the cause of the accident
that killed Joseph Kennedy Jr. in World War II, how Bobby Kennedy became
attorney general in 1960, and what JFK thought of U.S. military chiefs, their
plans for an invasion of Cuba, the American press corps in Saigon, and the
wisdom of an expanded war in Vietnam.</p>

<p>As with all our most
interesting public figures, Kennedy is an elusive character, a man who, like
all politicians, worked hard to emphasize his favorable attributes and hide his
limitations. He and those closest to him were extraordinarily skillful at
creating positive images that continue to shape public impressions. My
objective has not been to write another debunking book (these have been in ample
supply in recent years) but to penetrate the veneer of glamour and charm to
reconstruct the real man or as close to it as possible. The result is not a
sharply negative portrait but a description of someone with virtues and defects
that make him seem both exceptional and ordinary &#151; a man of uncommon
intelligence, drive, discipline, and good judgment on the one hand, and of
lifelong physical suffering and emotional problems on the other. I have not
emphasized one aspect over the other but have tried to bring them into balance.
Learning, for example, a great deal more than any biographer has previously
known about Kennedy's medical history allowed me to see not only the extent to
which he hid his infirmities from public view but also the man's exceptional
strength of character. In addition, I have tried to understand his indisputable
womanizing, including previously unknown instances of his compulsive philandering.
More significant, I have ventured answers to questions about whether his health
problems and behavior in any way undermined his performance of presidential
duties.</p>

<p>I have also tried to
judiciously assess the negative and positive family influences on his
character, the record of his navy service, his House and Senate careers, and,
most important, his presidential policies on the economy, civil rights, federal
aid to education, health insurance for seniors, and poverty, and, even more
consequentially, on dealings with Russia, nuclear weapons, space, Cuba, and
Vietnam. I have not hesitated to say what I believe Kennedy might have done
about the many ongoing problems certain to have faced him in a second term,
however open to question these conclusions may be. "It is better to debate a
question without settling it than to settle a question without debating it,"
said Joseph Joubert, a French philosopher of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>I believe this biography
provides the most authoritative discussion to date on Kennedy the man and his
political career. Nonetheless, however much it may be a significant advance in
understanding, I have no illusion that I am recording the last word on John F. Kennedy.
The economist Thorstein Veblen was surely right when he cautioned that "the
outcome of any serious research can only be to make two questions grow where
one question grew before." Add to this the man's almost mythical importance to
Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the globe and you can be
certain that future generations will be eager for renewed attention to him in the
context of their own times.</p>

</DIV><br>


      <ul><P><I>George Bernard Shaw, speaking as an
Irishman, summed up an approach to life: . . . "I dream things that
never were&#151;and I say:
            Why not?"</I><br>

&#151; John F. Kennedy before the Irish Parliament, June 28, 1963</P>
      </ul>

      <P>IN AUGUST 1947, John F. Kennedy traveled to
Ireland. The trip was notable for several reasons. Kennedy was first and
foremost a "good New
         Englander," an American&#151;so
said the Irish ambassador to the United States&#151;who had all but lost
his connection to the old country.
         Indeed, recalling how often
Jack Kennedy had visited England in the 1930s and early 1940s without going
to Ireland, the ambassador
         archly described Kennedy as "an
English American." "Many people made much of his Irish
ancestry," one of Kennedy's English
         friends said. But
he was "a European . . . more English than Irish." Now, at long
last, he was going home. That was not, however,
         how his father saw
it. For Joseph Patrick Kennedy, whose drive for social acceptance shadowed
most of what he did, being described
         as an "Irishman"
was cause for private rage. "Goddamn it!" he once sputtered
after a Boston newspaper identified him that
         way. "I was
born in this country! My children were born in this country! What the hell
does someone have to do to become an
         American?"
      </P>



      <P>But his son had if not formed a deep emotional attachment,
at least taken his cue from his mother's father, John F. Fitzgerald.

"There seems to be some disagreement as to whether my grandfather
Fitzgerald came from Wexford, Limerick or Tipperary," Kennedy

would later recall. "And it is even more confusing as to where my
great[-]grandmother came from&#151;because her son&#151;who was the

Mayor of Boston&#151;used to claim his mother came from whichever Irish
county had the most votes in the audience he was addressing
         at
that particular time." And indeed, when the twenty-nine-year-old had
first run for Congress the year before, Irish Americans
         in his
district had been hesitant to support Kennedy because of his lack of ethnic
identification, let alone pride.
      </P>



<P>Officially, Kennedy was on a fact-finding mission to study the potential
workings of the Marshall Plan in a Europe still reeling
         from the
devastation wrought by the Second World War. Unofficially, it was a chance
to relax with Kathleen Kennedy Hartington,
         Jack's favorite
younger sister, who was even more "English American" than he
was. Though her husband, William Cavendish Hartington,
         who was in
line to become the next duke of Devonshire, had died in the war, Kathleen
had stayed in England, where the Devonshires
         treated her with fond
regard. They gave her free run of their several great estates, including
Lismore Castle in southern
         Ireland's County Waterford, a
twelfth-century mansion once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh. Kathleen called
it the "most perfect
         place" in the world.
      </P>



      <P>Kathleen asked Jack to join her for a vacation at Lismore,
where she promised to bring him together with former Foreign Secretary

Anthony Eden; Pamela Churchill, the divorced wife of Winston's son,
Randolph; and other prominent English social and political
         lions.
"Anthony Eden arrives today," Kathleen wrote an American
friend, "so by the end of the week he and Jack will have fixed

up the state of the world."
      </P>


      <P>Like
Kathleen, Jack Kennedy had been schooled to move comfortably in privileged
circles. Jack and Kathleen did not think of
         themselves as anything
but American aristocrats. Wit, charm, and intelligence added to the cachet
he carried as a congressman
         and the son of one of America's
wealthiest entrepreneurs who himself was a former ambassador to Britain.

</P>


      <P>Yet those who met John Kennedy for the first
time in 1947 found little assurance in his appearance. Though having passed
his
         thirtieth birthday in the spring, he looked like "a
college boy," or at best a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in political
science.
         He contributed to the impression with his casual attire,
appearing sometimes on the House floor in khaki pants and a rumpled

seersucker jacket with a shirttail dangling below his coat or in the House
cafeteria line in sweater and sneakers. At six
         feet and only 140
pounds, his slender body, gaunt and freckled face, and full head of tousled
brown hair made him seem younger
         than his thirty years. Even when
he dressed in formal suits, which was not often, it did not make him look
older or like a
         congressman. "He wore the most godawful
suits," Mary Davis, his secretary, said. "Horrible looking,
hanging from his frame."
         Unlike so many members of the House
who self-consciously dressed the part, Kennedy reflected his sense of
entitlement in his
         informal dress. But it did not encourage an
impression of maturity, and it was difficult for most colleagues to take
him seriously.
         He initially struck veteran congressmen as the son
of a famous family who had inherited his office rather than earned it.

Sometimes he didn't impress them at all. "Well, how do you like
that?" he asked his congressional office staff one morning.

"Some people got into the elevator and asked me for the fourth
floor." During his first week in the House, a veteran congressman

who mistook him for a page demanded a copy of a bill until Jack informed
the astonished member that they were colleagues.
      </P>



<P>Nevertheless, he offended almost no one. Although he conveyed a certain
coolness or self-control, his radiant smile and genuine
         openness
made him immediately likable. "The effect he has on women voters was
almost naughty," <I>New York Times</I> columnist James Reston later
wrote. "Every woman either wants to mother him or marry him."
Another columnist saw something
         in his appearance that suggested
"to the suggestible that he is lost, stolen or strayed&#151;a prince
in exile, perhaps, or a very
         wealthy orphan."
      </P>



      <P>A visit to New Ross, a market town on the banks of the
Barrow River fifty miles east of Lismore, filled some of Jack's time

in Ireland. Kathleen, who spent the day playing golf with her guests, did
not join him. Instead, Pamela Churchill, whom Jack
         asked
"rather quietly, rather apologetically," went along. They drove
for five hours in Kathleen's huge American station wagon

over rutted roads along Ireland's scenic southeastern coast before
reaching the outskirts of the town.
      </P>


      <P>New
Ross was not casually chosen. As they approached, with only a letter from
his aunt Loretta, his father's sister, to guide
         him, Jack
stopped to ask directions to the Kennedy house. ("Which Kennedys will
it be that you'll be wanting?" the man replied.)
         Jack
tried a little white farmhouse on the edge of the village with a front yard
full of chickens and geese. A lady surrounded
         by six kids,
"looking just like all the Kennedys," greeted him with
suspicion. After sending for her husband, who was in the
         fields,
the family invited Jack and Pamela for tea in their thatched-roof cottage with a dirt floor. Though Pamela was impressed
         with the family's s
imple dignity, she compared the visit to a scene from Erskine
Caldwell's <I>Tobacco Road</I>.
      </P>



<P>Jack believed that he had discovered his third cousins and seemed to
enjoy himself thoroughly. Asking if he could do anything
         for them,
the cousins proposed that he "drive the children around the village
in the station wagon," which he did to their
         pleasure and
his. For her part, Pamela clearly did not understand "the magic of
the afternoon." Neither did Kathleen, who
         was angry when
Jack returned late for dinner. "Did they have a bathroom?" she
asked snidely.
      </P>


      <P>The successful striving of
her great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents&#151;the unceasing
ambition of the Fitzgeralds and
         the Kennedys&#151;had catapulted
the family into another realm, an ocean and a century apart from the
relatives left behind in
         Ireland. In America anything was
possible&#151;the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys were living proof. For most
of the family, these
         Kennedys of New Ross were something foreign,
something best ignored or forgotten. But not for Jack.
      </P>


<br><P>JACK HAD ONLY RUDIMENTARY KNOWLEDGE about his distant ancestors. He
knew that his great-grandfather Patrick Kennedy had come to East Boston
during the great
         potato famines of the late 1840s, worked as a
cooper making wagon staves and whiskey barrels, married Bridget Murphy,
and
         fathered three daughters and a son before he died of cholera
in 1858 when only thirty-five.
      </P>


      <P>Jack also
knew that his great-grandfather on his mother's side, Thomas
Fitzgerald, had clung to his farm in Ireland until
         1854, when the
famine drove him to America as well. Initially settling in Acton,
twenty-five miles west of Boston, his impoverishment
         as a farmer
forced him to take up life in Boston's North End Irish ghetto, a
crowded slum of wooden tenements. One contemporary
         described it as
a "dreary, dismal" desolate world in which all was "mean,
nasty, inefficient [and] forbidding," except for
         the
Catholic Church, which provided spiritual comfort and physical beauty.

</P>


      <P>In 1857 Thomas married Rosanna Cox, with whom
he had twelve children&#151;nine of whom reached maturity, an amazing
survival rate
         in a time when infant mortality was a common event.
Thomas, who lived until 1885, surviving Rosanna by six years, prospered

first as a street peddler of household wares and then in a grocery
business, which doubled as a North End tavern in the evenings.

Income from tenements he bought and rented to Irish laborers made his
family comfortable and opened the way to greater success
         for his
offspring.
      </P>


      <P>The limits of Jack's
knowledge about his Irish relatives was partly the result of his
parents' upward mobility and their eagerness
         to replace
their "Irishness" with an American identity. Rose Fitzgerald
Kennedy, Jack's mother, took pains to instill American

values in the children, ignoring their Irish roots and taking them to the
storied landmarks of the country's Revolutionary
         past around
Boston. This attitude differed little from that of other ethnic groups, who
tried to meet the demands of being
         an American by forgetting about
their Old World past, but in stratified Boston it took on special meaning.
Rose and Joe were
         understandably eager to insulate the family from
the continual snubs that Irish Americans suffered at the hands of local
Brahmins,
         well-off Protestant Americans whose roots went back to
the earliest years of the Republic. Although Rose and Joe enjoyed
privileged
         lives, their tangible sense of being outsiders in their
native land remained a social reality they struggled to overcome.

</P>


      <P>The Boston in which Joe and Rose grew up was
self-consciously "American." It was the breeding ground for the
values and spirit
         that had given birth to the nation and the
center of America's most famous university where so many of the
country's most
         influential leaders had been educated.
Snobbery or class consciousness was as much a part of the city's
landscape as Boston
         Common. Coming from the wrong side of the
tracks in most American cities was no fixed impediment to individual
success. But
         in Boston, where "the Lowells speak only to the
Cabots and the Cabots speak only to God," rising above one's
station was an
         enterprise for only the most ambitious.
      </P>



      <P>What vivid sense of family history there was began with
Jack's two grandfathers&#151;Patrick Joseph Kennedy and John F.
Fitzgerald,
         both impressively successful men who achieved local
fame and gave their children the wherewithal to enjoy comfortable lives.

Patrick Joseph Kennedy was born in 1858, the year his father died. In an
era when no public support program came to the aid
         of a widow with
four children, Bridget Murphy Kennedy, Patrick's mother, supported
the family as a saleswoman and shopkeeper.
         At age fourteen, P.J.,
as he was called, left school to work on the Boston docks as a stevedore to
help support his mother
         and three older sisters. In the 1880s,
with money he had saved from his modest earnings, he launched a business
career by
         buying a saloon in Haymarket Square. In time, he bought
a second establishment by the docks. To capitalize on the social drinking

of upper-class Boston, P.J. purchased a third bar in an upscale hotel, the
Maverick House.
      </P>


      <P>With his handlebar
mustache, white apron, and red sleeve garters, the stocky, blue-eyed,
red-haired P.J. cut a handsome figure
         behind the bar of his
taverns. By all accounts, he was a good listener who gained the regard and
even affection of his patrons.
         Before he was thirty, his growing
prosperity allowed him to buy a whiskey-importing business, P. J. Kennedy
and Company, that
         made him a leading figure in Boston's
liquor trade.
      </P>


      <P>Likable, always ready to
help less fortunate fellow Irishmen with a little cash and some sensible
advice, P.J. enjoyed the
         approval and respect of most folks in
East Boston, a mixed Boston neighborhood of upscale Irish and Protestant
elite. Beginning
         in 1884, he converted his popularity into five
consecutive one-year terms in the Massachusetts Lower House, followed by
three
         two-year terms in the state senate. Establishing himself as
one of Boston's principal Democratic leaders, he was invited to

give one of the seconding speeches for Grover Cleveland at the
party's 1888 national convention in St. Louis.
      </P>



      <P>But campaigning, speech making, and legislative maneuvering were
less appealing to him than the behind-the-scenes machinations
         that
characterized so much of Boston politics in the late-nineteenth and
early-twentieth centuries. After leaving the senate
         in 1895, P.J.
spent his political career in various appointive offices&#151;elections
commissioner and fire commissioner&#151;as the
         backroom boss of
Boston's Ward Two, and as a member of his party's unofficial
Board of Strategy. At board meetings over sumptuous
         lunches in
room eight of the Quincy House hotel near Scollay Square, P.J. and three
other power brokers from Charlestown and
         the South and North Ends
chose candidates for local and statewide offices and distributed
patronage.
      </P>


      <P>There was time for family,
too. In 1887 P.J. married Mary Augusta Hickey, a member of an affluent
"lace curtain" Irish family
         from the upscale suburb of
Brockton. The daughter of a successful businessman and the sister of a
police lieutenant, a physician
         with a Harvard medical degree, and
a funeral home director, Hickey had solidified Kennedy's move into
the newly emerging Irish
         middle class, or as legendary Boston
mayor James Michael Curley mockingly called them, "cut glass"
Irish or FIFs ("First Irish
         Families"). By the time he
died in 1929, P.J. had indeed joined the ranks of the cut-glass set,
holding an interest in a coal
         company and a substantial amount of
stock in a bank, the Columbia Trust Company. His wealth afforded his family
of one son,
         Joseph Patrick, and two daughters an attractive home
on Jeffries Point in East Boston.
      </P>


      <P>John F.
Fitzgerald was better known in Boston than P.J. and had a greater influence
on Jack's life. Born in 1863, John F.
         was the fourth of
twelve children. As a boy and a young man, his father's standing as a
successful businessman and his innate
         talents gained him admission
to Boston's storied Latin School (training ground for the offspring
of the city's most important
         families, including the
Adamses, John, John Quincy, and Henry), where he excelled at athletics and
compiled a distinguished
         academic record, graduating with honors.
Earning a degree at Boston College, the city's Jesuit university,
John F.&#151;or Johnnie
         Fitz or Fitzie, as friends called
him&#151;entered Harvard Medical School in 1884. When his father died in
the spring of 1885,
         he abandoned his medical education, which had
been more his father's idea than his own, to care for his six younger
brothers.
         Taking a job in the city's Customs House as a
clerk, he simultaneously converted an affinity for people and politics
into
         a job as a secretary to Matthew Keany, one of the Democratic
party's North End ward bosses.
      </P>


      <P>In
1891 Fitzie won election to a seat on Boston's Common Council, where
he overcame resistance from representatives of more
         affluent
districts to spend $350,000 on a public park for his poor North End
constituents. The following year, when Keany
         died,
Fitzgerald's seven-year apprenticeship in providing behind-the-scenes
services to constituents and manipulating local
         power made him
Keany's logical successor.
      </P>


      <P>He was a
natural politician&#151;a charming, impish, affable lover of people who
perfected the "Irish switch": chatting amiably
         with
one person while pumping another's hand and gazing fondly at a third.
His warmth of character earned him yet another
         nickname,
"Honey Fitz," and he gained a reputation as the only politician
who could sing "Sweet Adeline" sober and get away
         with
it. A pixielike character with florid face, bright eyes, and sandy hair, he
was a showman who could have had a career
         in vaudeville.

</P>


      <P>But politics, with all the brokering that went
into arranging alliances and the hoopla that went into campaigning, was
his
         calling. A verse of the day ran: "Honey Fitz can talk
you blind / on any subject you can find / Fish and fishing, motor boats

/ Railroads, streetcars, getting votes." His gift of gab became known
as Fitzblarney, and his followers as "dearos," a shortened

version of his description of his district as "the dear old North
End."
      </P>


      <P>Fitzgerald's amiability
translated into electoral successes. In 1892 he overcame internal bickering
among the ward bosses
         to win election to the state senate.
Compiling a progressive voting record and a reputation as an astute
legislator eager
         to meet the needs of every constituent,
Fitzgerald put himself forward in 1894 for the only sure Democratic
congressional
         seat in Massachusetts, Boston's Ninth
District. His candidacy pitted him against his fellow bosses on the
Strategy Board,
         who backed incumbent congressman Joseph
O'Neil. Running a brilliant campaign that effectively played on
suffering caused by
         the panic of 1893 and the subsequent
depression, Fitzgerald's torchlight parades and promises of public
programs produced
         an unprecedented turnout. Also helped by a
division among the bosses, who responded to his candidacy by failing to
unite against
         him, the thirty-one-year-old Fitzgerald won a
decisive primary victory.
      </P>


      <P>During three
terms in Congress, Fitzgerald voted consistently for measures serving local
and statewide needs, for laws favoring
         progressive income taxes
over higher protective tariffs, and for a continuation of unrestricted
immigration. Massachusetts'
         senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a
tall slender Brahmin who, with his Vandyke beard and courtly manner, could
not have been more
         of a contrast to Fitzgerald, once lectured the
Irishman on the virtues of barring inferior peoples&#151;indigestible
aliens&#151;from
         corrupting the United States. "You are an
impudent young man," Lodge began. "Do you think the Jews or the
Italians have any
         right in this country?" Fitzgerald
replied: "As much right as your father or mine. It was only a
difference of a few ships."
      </P>


      <P>At the
end of three terms as one of only three Catholics in the House, Fitzgerald
announced his decision not to run again.
         It was a prelude to
gaining the post he wished above all, mayor of Boston. During the next five
years, while he waited for
         a favorable moment to run, he prospered
as the publisher of a local newspaper, <I>The Republic</I>. Demonstrating a
keen business sense, Fitzgerald substantially increased department-store
advertising in his pages by running
         stories of special interest to
women.
      </P>


      <P>One of the city's leading
political power brokers as the boss of the North End's Ward Six,
despite having moved to Concord
         and then Dorchester, Fitzgerald
was in a strong position to become mayor when the incumbent died in 1905.
But another round
         of opposition from his fellow bosses, including
P.J., put his election in doubt. In response, he devised a shrewd
anti-boss
         campaign that appealed to current progressive antagonism
to undemocratic machine politics. Despite a bruising primary fight

and another closely contested race against a formidable Republican,
Fitzgerald gained the prize, chanting, "The people not
         the
bosses must rule! Bigger, better, busier Boston." Within hours of
winning the election, he showed up at P. J. Kennedy's
         East
Boston office to say that there were no hard feelings about P.J.'s
opposition to him. It was, two family biographers
         later said,
"a first hurrah for the dynasty to come."
      </P>


<br><P>HONEY FITZ HAD COMPLEMENTED his political and business successes
with marriage to his second cousin, Mary Josephine Hannon, or Josie, as
intimates called
         her. They had met first in Acton at the
Hannons' farm in September 1878, when Fitzgerald was fifteen and
Josie thirteen. As
         he remembered it, he immediately fell in love
with the beautiful girl to whom he would be married for sixty-two years,
but
         Fitzgerald had to wait eleven years before Josie's
family put aside their concerns about the consequences of having Josie

marry a blood relative, however distant. The union produced six children,
three sons and three daughters.
      </P>


      <P>The
eldest of the Fitzgerald children, Rose Elizabeth, was Fitz's
favorite. Praying for a daughter who might fulfill his dreams
    of
winning acceptance into polite society, Honey Fitz envisioned Rose's
life as a storybook tale of proper upbringing and
         social acclaim.
As Rose later viewed it, her father succeeded: "There have been times
when I felt I was one of the more fortunate
         people in the world,
almost as if Providence, or Fate, or Destiny, as you like, had chosen me
for special favors."
      </P>


      <P>From her birth
in the summer of 1890, she led a privileged life. When Rose was seven, Fitz
and Josie moved the family to the
         Boston suburb of West Concord,
where Rose remembers "a big, old rambling . . . wonderfully
comfortable house" and the traditional
         pleasures and
satisfactions of life in a small New England town: "serenity, order,
family affection, horse-and-buggy rides
         to my grandparents'
nearby home, climbing apple trees, picking wild flowers." There was
the excitement of a father coming
         home on weekends from
Washington, where, in Rose's limited understanding, he was something
called a "congressman" doing important
         things.
Whatever her sadness at his frequent absences, she remembered "the
absolute thrill" of driving to the Concord train
         station to
meet him and his affectionate greeting, with "a wonderful
present" always pulled from his bags. She also recalled
         a
trip to the White House at age seven with her father, where President
William McKinley warmly greeted them and gave her
         a carnation.
"There was no one in the world like my father," she said.
"Wherever he was, there was magic in the air." There

were also the memories of the matched pair of beautiful black horses that
pulled the family carriage and of her own rig that
         at twelve she
began driving to the Concord library to borrow books.
      </P>



      <P>There were also the summers in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, where
Boston's prominent Irish families would seek the pleasure of

one another's company and relief from the heat. A beachfront crowded
with hotels, cottages, and gregarious folks strolling,
         sunning
themselves, swimming, fishing, shopping, playing cards, and eating together
in the Brunswick Hotel's huge dining room,
         Old Orchard was
described as "the typical watering place for those who detest the
name of solitude." Rose remembered the joy
         of playing with
other children and being surrounded by relatives and family friends who
"visited back and forth constantly."
      </P>



<P>In 1904, having grown affluent on the returns from <I>The Republic,</I>
the Fitzgeralds moved to suburban Dorchester, where their growing family of
three girls and two boys lived in a sprawling
         fifteen-room house
with a "scrollwork porch, mansard turret, and stained-glass insert in
the front door portraying what Fitzie
         insisted was the
family's coat of arms." Rose attended the Dorchester High
School for Girls and, like her proper Bostonian
         Beacon Hill
counterparts, rounded out her education with private lessons in French,
dancing, piano, and voice.
      </P>



<P>Dorchester's remove from the center of Boston allowed Fitz to
insulate Rose and the family from the rough-and-tumble politics
         of
his 1905 mayoral campaign. Though now fifteen, Rose had only "a hazy
idea of what was happening." This was a good thing,
         for it
was a contest with much name-calling and ugly innuendoes about her
father's private life and public dealings that would
         have
offended any loving daughter, especially one as starry-eyed as Rose.

</P>


      <P>Rose's sheltered life extended into her
twenties. At seventeen, as the mayor's vivacious, intelligent
daughter, Rose had become
         something of a Boston celebrity, in
attendance at "allmanner of political and social events."
Wellesley was an ideal college
         choice for so talented and
prominent a young woman: It represented the chance to enter an exciting
universe of intellectual
         and political discourse in the
country's finest women's college. But believing her too young
and impressionable, Fitz enrolled
         her in an elite Catholic school,
Boston's Convent of the Sacred Heart, where she received instruction
in deportment and feminine
         virtues promising to make her a model
wife and mother.
      </P>


      <P>At the close of
Rose's year in Sacred Heart, the Fitzgeralds took their two eldest
daughters on a grand European tour. Ostensibly,
         it was to broaden
the girls' education. But Fitz, who had lost a reelection bid as
mayor in 1907 and was under suspicion of
         lining his pockets during
his two-year term, saw the summer trip as a chance to shield Rose and her
sister Agnes from press
         coverage of his wrongdoing. To keep them
away from the unpleasant public gossip and discourage a budding romance
with Joseph
         Patrick Kennedy, P.J.'s son, the child of a
family with less social standing, Fitz also decided to enroll Rose and
Agnes for
         the 1908-09 academic year in a Sacred Heart convent
school in Holland. Attended mainly by the daughters of French and German

aristocrats and well-off merchant families, it was a more cosmopolitan
version of its Boston counterpart.
      </P>


      <P>After
coming home in the summer of 1909, Rose took refuge from the political wars
with another year of schooling at the Sacred
         Heart Convent in
Manhattanville, New York. At the close of that year, she returned to Boston
ready to assume a large role
         in her father's second term,
which ran from 1910 to 1912. With two small children to care for and little
patience for the
         duties of a political first lady, Josie left the
part to Rose, who filled it with a style and grace reflecting her
advantaged
         upbringing and education. She became Honey Fitz's
constant "hostess-companion-helper," traveling with him to
Chicago and Kansas
         on city business, to the Panama Canal to
consider its effect on Boston's future as an international trade
center, to western
         Europe to advance Boston's commerce with
its principal cities, to meet President William Howard Taft at the White
House, and
         to attend the 1912 Democratic National Convention in
Baltimore that nominated New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson for president.

As one biographer records: "Fitzgerald delighted in the good looks of
his daughter, in her intelligence, her presence of mind
         and superb
social skills. . . . She proved to be her father's equal in
conversation, curiosity, dancing, athletic ability
         and powers of
endurance and even in the capacity for fascinating reporters," who
gave her front-page coverage in Boston's
         newspapers.

</P>


      <P>Nothing more clearly marked Rose as a local
leading light than her coming-out party in January 1911. The state's
most prominent
         figures were counted among the 450 guests in
attendance. Even the normal social barriers between Protestants and
Catholics
         fell away for the occasion: Massachusetts'
governor-elect, two congressmen, Boston's district attorney and city
councilmen&#151;who
         declared the day a holiday&#151;rubbed
shoulders with wealthy and fashionable bankers, businessmen, attorneys,
physicians, and
         clergymen.
      </P>


      <P>By
the conventions of the time, Rose's debut at age twenty was a prelude
to courtship and marriage. She certainly did not
         lack for suitors,
but by accepted standards, they did not include Protestants. The
"mistrust" and "resentment" between Boston's

Brahmins and its Irish Catholics caused them to have "as little as
possible to do with each other." And even though her father

had fostered better relations by joining with Brahmin James Jackson Storrow
to establish the Boston City Club, a place where
         both sides could
meet in "a neutral and socially relaxed atmosphere," Rose saw
the divide as "one of those elementary facts
         of life not
worth puzzling about." Besides, there were enough eligible Catholic
men who could measure up to her status, including,
         she believed,
P.J.'s son, Joe, whom she had known almost her entire life and who
impressed her&#151;if not her own father&#151;as a
         most
desirable mate.
