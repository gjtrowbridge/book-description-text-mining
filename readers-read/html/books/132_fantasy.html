<B><BR>CHAPTER
            1</B><BR><BR>�He�s not dead�but watch out for the winged
            snake.�<BR><BR>As she studied the tall young man lying unconscious
            on the fast-moving gurney, the alert eyes of the duty physician at
            Reides Central narrowed. �What winged snake?�<BR><BR>The harried
            medtech guiding the gurney gestured at the slow rise and fall of the
            patient�s chest. �It�s coiled up under his shirt between his left
            arm and his ribs. Squirmed in there and hid when we arrived to pick
            him up. Sticks its head out occasionally for a quick look around,
            but that�s all. Won�t leave. Hasn�t bothered anyone�so far. Almost
            as if it senses we�re trying to help.�<BR><BR>The emergency sector
            physician nodded tersely as she continued to pace the gurney. �I�ll
            be sure and keep my fingers away. Why wasn�t it caught and
            neutralized before the patient was brought in?�<BR><BR>The medtech
            glanced sideways at her. �Quickref says it�s an Alaspinian minidrag.
            They bond emotionally with their owners. If you�d heard what I was
            told, you wouldn�t get any ideas about trying to separate
            them.�<BR><BR>They rounded a corner, dodged an oncoming stasis
            chair, and headed up another corridor. �Hell of a way to practice
            medicine,� the doctor muttered to no one in particular. �Like there
            aren�t enough obstacles put in our way.� She leaned slightly forward
            over the motionless form, but she was unable to detect any movement
            in the indicated area. �It�s dangerous, then?�<BR><BR>The medtech
            smoothly eased the gurney into an empty monitoring chamber.
            �Apparently only if you try to separate them. Or if it thinks you�re
            trying to harm its master.�<BR><BR>�We�re trying to help him, just
            like we�re trying to help all the others who were brought
            in.�<BR><BR>As soon as the waiting sensors detected the gurney�s
            presence, a dozen different automated appliances initiated a
            standard preliminary patient scan. They automatically disregarded
            the presence of the flying snake just as they ignored the basic but
            neat and clean clothing in which the patient was dressed. The doctor
            stepped back from the gurney and examined her pad as one recording
            after another was made and silently transferred. A duplicate set was
            simultaneously being entered into the official hospital
            files.<BR><BR>The medtech looked on thoughtfully. �Want me to
            stay?�<BR><BR>When the doctor glanced up from her softly glowing
            pad, it was only to eye the patient. �Up to you. I�ll be careful of
            the snake.� Now that she knew where it was, she could see the slight
            bulge occasionally moving beneath the patient�s shirt. �If I have
            any problems, I�ll alert Security.�<BR><BR>Nodding, the medtech
            turned to go. �Suit yourself. They probably need me in Receiving
            now, anyway.�<BR><BR>The doctor continued speaking without looking
            at him. �How many all together?�<BR><BR>�Twenty-two. All standing,
            walking, or sitting within a few meters of one another in the same
            part of the Reides shopping complex. All displayed the same
            symptoms: a sharp gasp, followed by a rolling back of the eyes, and
            down they went�out cold. Adults, children, males, females�two
            thranx, one Tolian, the rest human. No external signs of injury, no
            indication of stroke or myocardial infarction, nothing. As if they�d
            all simultaneously been put to sleep. That�s what the official
            witness reports say, anyway. They�re pretty consistent
            throughout.�<BR><BR>She gestured absently. �It�ll take a minute or
            two for Processing to finish admitting this one. First thing we�ll
            do is correlate data between patients for indications of other
            similarities, so we can try and define some parameters. I�d be
            surprised if there weren�t several.� Her voice fell slightly.
            �There�d better be.�<BR><BR>Halfway out the portal, the medtech
            hesitated. �Viral or bacterial infection?�<BR><BR>�Nothing that
            contradicts it, but it�s much too early to say.� She looked up from
            her pad to meet his gaze. Concern was writ large there, and he was
            clearly looking for some sort of reassurance. �At a guess, I�d say
            neither one. The zone of influence was too sharply circumscribed.
            Same goes for a narcoleptic gas. And there are no overt indicators
            that would indicate an airborne infectious agent�no elevated or
            reduced blood pressure, no respiratory problems, no dermatological
            indications, no dilated pupils: not so much as a rash or a reported
            sneezing fit.�<BR><BR>�What then?�<BR><BR>�Again, it�s too soon to
            say. Some kind of area-specific sonic projection, maybe, though
            there�s no evidence of cochlear damage in any of the patients.
            Delineated flash hallucinogen, cerebroelectrical interrupt�there are
            numerous possibilities. Based on what I�ve read and seen so far, I�d
            say the event was a site-specific one-time event, and that no
            organic agent is involved. But that�s a very preliminary
            assessment.�<BR><BR>With a grateful nod, the medtech departed. As
            the portal opaqued behind him, the doctor turned back to her
            patient.<BR><BR>Other than being taller than average and discounting
            the presence of the alien pet, he appeared no different from others
            who had been brought in. She knew results were expected fast. Having
            twenty-two customers suddenly drop unconscious in one�s place of
            business was not good publicity for any enterprise. Fortunately for
            Reides�s management, everything had happened so quickly and the
            local emergency teams had reacted rapidly enough that the local
            media had not yet found their way to the hospital. By the time they
            did, she and her fellow consulting physicians hoped to be ready with
            some answers.<BR><BR>An attractive young man, she decided, with his
            red hair and olive-hued skin. Tall, slim, and apparently healthy, if
            one discounted his current condition. She guessed him to be
            somewhere in his early twenties. A universal command bracelet
            encircled one wrist, but there was no sign of whatever specially
            attuned devices it might control. Probably nothing more elaborate
            than a vit player, she decided. If it contained usable ident and
            medical information, the medtech had failed to tap into it. Well,
            that could come later, following the initial diagnosis. The scanners
            would tell her everything she needed to know to prescribe treatment.
            On the bracelet a single telltale glowed softly green, showing that
            it was active.<BR><BR>Beneath the patient�s shirt, a ropy shape
            shifted position. She did her best not to stare in its direction.
            She knew nothing about Alaspinian minidrags beyond the little the
            medtech had just told her. As long as it did not interfere with her
            work, she had no desire to know more.<BR><BR>She fidgeted, waiting
            for the scanners to finish. Even though no serious trauma was
            involved, the sudden influx of unconscious patients had momentarily
            overwhelmed the hospital�s emergency staff. She was already eager to
            move on to the next patient.<BR><BR>The preliminary readings began
            appearing on her pad as well as on the main monitor that projected
            from the wall. Heart rate, hemoglobin content, white cell count,
            respiration, temperature: everything was well within normal,
            accepted parameters. If anything, the readings suggested an
            exceptionally healthy individual. Cerebral scan indicated that the
            patient was presently engaged in active dreaming. Neural activity
            levels . . . general brain scan . . .<BR><BR>She frowned, checked
            her pad again. Her eyes rose to squint at the main monitor. It was
            already scrolling through a list of possible allergies and finding
            none. Manually interrupting the process, she used her pad to go back
            to the readout that had attracted her attention. It now appeared on
            both her pad and the monitor as a separate insert.<BR><BR>The
            figures were wrong. They had to be wrong. So was the direct imaging.
            There had to be something the matter with this room�s cerebral
            scanner. If its results had been a little off, she would have put it
            down to a calibration error. But the readouts were so far out of
            line that she was concerned they could potentially compromise
            patient treatment.<BR><BR>For one thing the patient�s parietal
            lobes�the parts of the brain responsible for handling visual and
            spatial tasks�appeared grossly swollen. Since according to the
            steadily lengthening list of benchmarks being provided by the
            instrumentation there was no neurobiological basis for such
            enlargement, it had to be a scanner error. However, that did not
            account for the exceptionally heightened blood flow to all parts of
            the patient�s brain, nor for what appeared to be some completely
            unrecognizable enzymatic and electrical activity. Furthermore,
            although the frontal cortex was quite dense, its apparent normality
            was hardly in keeping with the contrasting readouts for other
            portions of the cerebellum.<BR><BR>While many neurons were perfectly
            normal, dense clusters of others scanned in certain parts of the
            brain were swollen so large and were so inundated with activity as
            to suggest a potentially fatal ongoing mutation�potentially, because
            it was patently evident that the patient was still alive. Deeper
            probing soon discovered additional unnatural distortions, including
            what appeared to be scattered small tumors of a type and extensive
            neural integration she had not previously encountered, either in
            vivo or the medical literature.<BR><BR>She was not prepared to go
            beyond initial observation to render a formal interpretation of what
            she was seeing. She was no specialist, and these readings cried out
            for one capable of properly analyzing them. That, or a technician to
            repair and recalibrate the scanners. She opted to seek the latter�s
            advice first. Bad scans made more sense than neurobiological
            impossibilities. Take those distinctive tumors, for example. By
            rights, intrusive growths of such size and in such locations should
            have resulted in a serious degeneration of cognitive faculties or
            even death. Yet all correlating scans indicated normal ongoing
            physiological activity. Of course, she couldn�t be sure the patient
            was not an idiot until he woke up and started to respond. All she
            knew was that for a dumb dead man, he appeared to be in excellent
            shape.</FONT>
