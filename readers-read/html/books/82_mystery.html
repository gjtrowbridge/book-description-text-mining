<h4 align="center">Chapter One</h4>

<p>"Rosato & Associates," Mary DiNunzio said into the receiver,
then kicked herself for answering the phone. The caller was
Premenstrual Tom, a man who wanted to sue the Philadelphia
Police Department, the United States Congress, and a local
cantaloupe. He'd been calling the office at all hours, and Mary
felt sorry for him. He was obviously off his meds and had
reached one of the few lawyers in the city who wouldn't sue
fruit.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Thomas Cott!" he shouted. "Who's this?"</p>

<p>"I'm Mary DiNunzio. We spoke yesterday -- "</p>

<p>"Get me Ms. Benedetta Rosato!"</p>

<p>"Ms. Rosato is gone for the day, sir." Mary checked her
watch. 10:16 <small>P.M.</small> Everyone had gone home hours ago, and
until now, the offices had been blessedly quiet. "The office is
closed."</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing there, Ms. Mary DiNunzio?"</p>

<p><i>Good question, Mr. Thomas Cott</i>. Mary was working late
again, reading until her brown eyes turned red and her contacts
dried to the crispness of breakfast cereal. Documents
blanketed the conference table like a legal snowstorm, and her
compact figure had been curled into the swivel chair for so long she felt like a meatball. "Mr. Cott, I'll take a message and
tell Bennie -- "</p>

<p>"I refuse to leave any more messages! Get Ms. Benedetta
Rosato on the line! I demand to know why she won't represent
me! She specializes in constitutional rights, it says so on the
computer!"</p>

<p>"The computer?"</p>

<p>"In the library! The website, <i>your</i> website! It says it right
there! That's false advertising! What about <i>my</i> constitutional
rights? They don't matter? I don't matter?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cott, no lawyer can take every case," Mary answered,
then hesitated. Bennie had told the associates not to engage
Premenstrual Tom, but if she could explain it to him, maybe
he'd stop calling. "I think Bennie told you she didn't think
your case could prevail in court. She's practiced constitutional
law for a long time and has excellent judgment, so -- "</p>

<p>"All those judges are in on it! All of them are crooked,
every single one of them! City Hall is a pit of conspiracy and
corruption! They're all in the mayor's pocket!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cott, the judges in City Hall aren't crooked, and your
case would be in federal court anyway -- "</p>

<p>"You're not fooling me, either of you! Put Ms. Benedetta
Rosato on the telephone right now! I know she's there! She
must be, she's not at home!"</p>

<p>Mary blinked. "How do you know she's -- "</p>

<p>"I went to her house! I knocked on her door, I waited for her
to answer! The windows were dark!"</p>

<p>Mary stiffened. "How did you get her address?"</p>

<p>"It's in the phone book, I looked it up! What do you think I
am, <i>incapable</i>? I may not have a fancy law degree, but I am not
<i>incapable</i>, MS. MARY DiNUNZIO!"</p>

<p>Mary suddenly stopped feeling sorry for him. He was shouting
louder now, almost screaming.</p>

<p>"I SAID, get MS. BENEDETTA ROSATO on this telephone
RIGHT NOW! I KNOW she's right there with you!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cott, if you'll just -- "</p>

<p>"DON'T LIE TO ME! Don't you DARE LIE TO ME!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cott, I'm not -- "</p>

<p>"I'll come down there, you LYING WHORE! I'll come
down there and SHOOT -- "</p>

<p>Mary hung up, shaken. The conference room fell abruptly
silent. The air felt charged. It took her a moment to process
what had just happened. Okay, Premenstrual Tom had morphed
into Psychotic Tom, and it wasn't funny anymore. Bennie was
at an ACLU dinner, but it would be ending soon. She could be
going home. Mary had to warn her. She reached for the phone
to call the boss's cell.</p>

<p><i>Rring, rrriiinng</i>! The phone rang underneath Mary's hand,
jarring her. <i>Rrrriiinng</i>! She gritted her teeth and let it ring
twice more so voicemail would pick up. She should never have
engaged Premenstrual Tom. When would she learn? Her goodgirl
reflexes -- Help Out, Be Nice, Tell the Truth -- sucked in the
practice of law.</p>

<p>Mary pushed the button for her direct phone line and called
Bennie, but there was no answer. She left a detailed message,
then hung up, uneasy. She'd call her back in five minutes to
make sure the boss had gotten the message.</p>

<p>Mary eased back in her swivel chair, wishing suddenly that
she weren't alone in the office. She eyed the doorway to the
conference room, surprised to find the threshold dark. Who
turned out the lights in the reception area? Maybe the cleaning
people, when they'd left.</p>

<p><i>I'll come down there and shoot</i></p>

<p>Mary eyed the phone, daring it to ring again. She didn't
leave it off the hook because the drill was to record threatening
messages for evidence, in case the office had to go for a restraining
order, like with Premenstrual Fred. Mary wondered
fleetingly if she could find a career that didn't attract garden variety
homicidal rage or bad television commercials.</p>

<p>She told herself to get over it. Premenstrual Tom had been blowing off steam, and there was a security desk in the lobby
of the building. The guard wouldn't let anybody upstairs without
calling her first, especially after business hours, and nowadays
you couldn't get past the desk without a driver's license
and a mortgage note.</p>

<p>She got back to work, tucking a dark blonde tendril into its
loose French twist, and picking up the document she'd been
reading. It was a letter dated December 17, 1941, from the
provost marshal general's office, a federal agency that no
longer existed. Its type was grainy because it was a Xerox copy
of a photocopy of a carbon copy, and on another night, Mary
would have gotten a charge out of its vintage. Everybody in the
office called her case the History Channel, but she loved the
History Channel. Mary loved mostly everything on cable except
The Actor's Studio, which she wouldn't watch at gunpoint.
But she didn't want to think about gunpoint right now ...
