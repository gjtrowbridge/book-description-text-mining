Chapter 1<br><br>    At twenty-four the ambassador&#8217;s daughter slept badly through the warm,   unsurprising nights. She woke up frequently and even when sleep did   come her body was rarely at rest, thrashing and flailing as if trying   to break free of dreadful invisible manacles. At times she cried out in   a language she did not speak. Men had told her this, nervously. Not   many men had ever been permitted to be present while she slept. The   evidence was therefore limited, lacking consensus; however, a pattern   emerged. According to one report she sounded guttural, glottal-stoppy,   as if she were speaking Arabic. Night-Arabian, she thought, the   dreamtongue of Scheherazade. Another version described her words as   science-fictional, like Klingon, like a throat being cleared in a   galaxy far, far away. Like Sigourney Weaver channeling a demon in   Ghostbusters. One night in a spirit of research the ambassador&#8217;s   daughter left a tape recorder running by her bedside but when she heard   the voice on the tape its death&#8217;s-head ugliness, which was somehow both   familiar and alien, scared her badly and she pushed the erase button,   which erased nothing important. The truth was still the truth.<br><br>    These agitated periods of sleep-speech were mercifully brief, and when   they ended she would subside for a time, sweating and panting, into a   state of dreamless exhaustion. Then abruptly she would awake again,   convinced, in her disoriented state, that there was an intruder in her   bedroom. There was no intruder. The intruder was an absence, a negative   space in the darkness. She had no mother. Her mother had died giving   her birth: the ambassador&#8217;s wife had told her this much, and the   ambassador, her father, had confirmed it. Her mother had been Kashmiri,   and was lost to her, like paradise, like Kashmir, in a time before   memory. (That the terms Kashmir and paradise were synonymous was one of   her axioms, which everyone who knew her had to accept.) She trembled   before her mother&#8217;s absence, a void sentinel shape in the dark, and   waited for the second calamity, waited without knowing she was waiting.   After her father died&#8212;her brilliant, cosmopolitan father,   Franco-American, &#8220;like Liberty,&#8221; he said, her beloved, resented,   wayward, promiscuous, often absent, irresistible father&#8212;she began to   sleep soundly, as if she had been shriven. Forgiven her sins, or,   perhaps, his. The burden of sin had been passed on. She did not believe   in sin.<br><br>    So until her father&#8217;s death she was not an easy woman to sleep with,   though she was a woman with whom men wanted to sleep. The pressure of   men&#8217;s desires was tiresome to her. The pressure of her own desires was   for the most part unrelieved. The few lovers she took were variously   unsatisfactory and so (as if to declare the subject closed) she soon   enough settled on one pretty average fellow, and even gave serious   consideration to his proposal of marriage. Then the ambassador was   slaughtered on her doorstep like a halal chicken dinner, bleeding to   death from a deep neck wound caused by a single slash of the assassin&#8217;s   blade. In broad daylight! How the weapon must have glistened in the   golden morning sun; which was the city&#8217;s quotidian blessing, or its   curse. The daughter of the murdered man was a woman who hated good   weather, but most of the year the city offered little else.   Accordingly, she had to put up with long monotonous months of   shadowless sunshine and dry, skin-cracking heat. On those rare mornings   when she awoke to cloud cover and a hint of moisture in the air she   stretched sleepily in bed, arching her back, and was briefly, even   hopefully, glad; but the clouds invariably burned off by noon and then   there it was again, the dishonest nursery blue of the sky that made the   world look childlike and pure, the loud impolite orb blaring at her   like a man laughing too loudly in a restaurant.<br><br>    In such a city there could be no grey areas, or so it seemed. Things   were what they were and nothing else, unambiguous, lacking the   subtleties of drizzle, shade and chill. Under the scrutiny of such a   sun there was no place to hide. People were everywhere on display,   their bodies shining in the sunlight, scantily clothed, reminding her   of advertisements. No mysteries here or depths; only surfaces and   revelations. Yet to learn the city was to discover that this banal   clarity was an illusion. The city was all treachery, all deception, a   quick-change, quicksand metropolis, hiding its nature, guarded and   secret in spite of all its apparent nakedness. In such a place even the   forces of destruction no longer needed the shelter of the dark. They   burned out of the morning&#8217;s brightness, dazzling the eye, and stabbed   at you with sharp and fatal light.<br><br>    Her name was India. She did not like this name. People were never   called Australia, were they, or Uganda or Ingushetia or Peru. In the   mid-1960s her father, Max Ophuls (Maximilian Ophuls, raised in   Strasbourg, France, in an earlier age of the world), had been America&#8217;s   best-loved, and then most scandalous, ambassador to India, but so what,   children were not saddled with names like Herzegovina or Turkey or   Burundi just because their parents had visited those lands and possibly   misbehaved in them. She had been conceived in the East&#8212;conceived out of   wedlock and born in the midst of the firestorm of outrage that twisted   and ruined her father&#8217;s marriage and ended his diplomatic career&#8212;but if   that were sufficient excuse, if it was okay to hang people&#8217;s   birthplaces round their necks like albatrosses, then the world would be   full of men and women called Euphrates or Pisgah or Iztacc&#237;huatl or   Woolloomooloo. In America, damn it, this form of naming was not   unknown, which spoiled her argument slightly and annoyed her more than   somewhat. Nevada Smith, Indiana Jones, Tennessee Williams, Tennessee   Ernie Ford: she directed mental curses and a raised middle finger at   them all.<br><br>    &#8220;India&#8221; still felt wrong to her, it felt exoticist, colonial,   suggesting the appropriation of a reality that was not hers to own, and   she insisted to herself that it didn&#8217;t fit her anyway, she didn&#8217;t feel   like an India, even if her color was rich and high and her long hair   lustrous and black. She didn&#8217;t want to be vast or subcontinental or   excessive or vulgar or explosive or crowded or ancient or noisy or   mystical or in any way Third World. Quite the reverse. She presented   herself as disciplined, groomed, nuanced, inward, irreligious,   understated, calm. She spoke with an English accent. In her behavior   she was not heated, but cool. This was the persona she wanted, that she   had constructed with great determination. It was the only version of   her that anyone in America, apart from her father and the lovers who   had been scared off by her nocturnal proclivities, had ever seen. As to   her interior life, her violent English history, the buried record of   disturbed behavior, the years of delinquency, the hidden episodes of   her short but eventful past, these things were not subjects for   discussion, were not (or were no longer) of concern to the general   public. These days she had herself firmly in hand. The problem child   within her was sublimated into her spare-time pursuits, the weekly   boxing sessions at Jimmy Fish&#8217;s boxing club on Santa Monica and Vine   where Tyson and Christy Martin were known to work out and where the   cold fury of her hitting made the male boxers pause to watch, the   biweekly training sessions with a Clouseau-attacking Burt Kwouk   look-alike who was a master of the close-combat martial art of Wing   Chun, the sun-bleached blackwalled solitude of Saltzman&#8217;s Moving Target   shooting gallery out in the desert at 29 Palms, and, best of all, the   archery sessions in downtown Los Angeles near the city&#8217;s birthplace in   Elysian Park, where her new gifts of rigid self-control, which she had   learned in order to survive, to defend herself, could be used to go on   the attack. As she drew back her golden Olympic-standard bow, feeling   the pressure of the bowstring against her lips, sometimes touching the   bottom of the arrow shaft with the tip of her tongue, she felt the   arousal in herself, allowed herself to feel the heat rising in her   while the seconds allotted to her for the shot ticked down toward zero,   until at last she let fly, unleashing the silent venom of the arrow,   reveling in the distant thud of her weapon hitting its target. The   arrow was her weapon of choice.<br><br>    She also kept the strangeness of her seeing under control, the sudden   otherness of vision that came and went. When her pale eyes changed the   things she saw, her tough mind changed them back. She did not care to   dwell on her turbulence, never spoke about her childhood, and told   people she did not remember her dreams.<br><br>    On her twenty-fourth birthday the ambassador came to her door. She   looked down from her fourth-floor balcony when he buzzed and saw him   waiting in the heat of the day wearing his absurd silk suit like a   French sugar daddy. Holding flowers, yet. &#8220;People will think you&#8217;re my   lover,&#8221; India shouted down to Max, &#8220;my cradle-snatching Valentine.&#8221; She   loved the ambassador when he was embarrassed, the pained furrow of his   brow, the right shoulder hunching up against his ear, the hand raised   as if to ward off a blow. She saw him fracture into rainbow colors   through the prism of her love. She watched him recede into the past as   he stood below her on the sidewalk, each successive moment of him   passing before her eyes and being lost forever, surviving only in outer   space in the form of escaping light-rays. This is what loss was, what   death was: an escape into the luminous wave-forms, into the ineffable   speed of the light-years and the parsecs, the eternally receding   distances of the cosmos. At the rim of the known universe an   unimaginable creature would someday put its eye to a telescope and see   Max Ophuls approaching, wearing a silk suit and carrying birthday   roses, forever borne forward on tidal waves of light. Moment by moment   he was leaving her, becoming an ambassador to such unthinkably distant   elsewheres. She closed her eyes and opened them again. No, he was not   billions of miles away amid the wheeling galaxies. He was here, correct   and present, on the street where she lived.<br><br>    He had recovered his poise. A woman in running clothes rounded the   corner from Oakwood and cantered toward him, appraising him, making the   easy judgments of the times, judgments about sex and money. He was one   of the architects of the postwar world, of its international   structures, its agreed economic and diplomatic conventions. His tennis   game was strong even now, at his advanced age. The inside-out forehand,   his surprise weapon. That wiry frame in long white trousers, carrying   not much more than five percent body fat, could still cover the court.   He reminded people of the old champion Jean Borotra: those few   old-timers who remembered Borotra. He stared with undisguised European   pleasure at the jogger&#8217;s American breasts in their sports bra. As she   passed him he offered her a single rose from the enormous birthday   bouquet. She took the flower; and then, appalled by his charm, by the   erotic proximity of his snappy crackle of power, and by herself,   accelerated anxiously away. Fifteen&#8211;love.<br><br>     From the balconies of the apartment building the old Central and East   European ladies were also staring at Max, admiringly, with the open   lust of toothless age. His arrival was the high point of their month.   They were out en masse today. Usually they gathered together in small   street-corner clumps or sat in twos and threes by the courtyard   swimming pool chewing the fat, sporting inadvisable beachwear without   shame. Usually they slept a lot and when not sleeping complained. They   had buried the husbands with whom they had spent forty or even fifty   years of unregarded life. Stooped, leaning, expressionless, the old   women lamented the mysterious destinies that had stranded them here,   halfway across the world from their points of origin. They spoke in   strange tongues that might have been Georgian, Croatian, Uzbek. Their   husbands had failed them by dying. They were pillars that had fallen,   they had asked to be relied upon and had brought their wives away from   everything that was familiar into this shadowless lotus-land full of   the obscenely young, this California whose body was its temple and   whose ignorance was its bliss, and then proved themselves unreliable by   keeling over on the golf course or face down in a bowl of noodle soup,   thus revealing to their widows at this late stage in their lives the   untrustworthiness of existence in general and of husbands in   particular. In the evenings the widows sang childhood songs from the   Baltic, from the Balkans, from the vast Mongolian plains.<br><br>    The neighborhood&#8217;s old men were single, too, some inhabiting sagging   sacks of bodies over which gravity had exerted far too much power,   others grizzle-chopped and letting themselves go in dirty T-shirts and   pants with unbuttoned flies, while a third, jauntier contingent dressed   sharply, affecting berets and bow ties. These natty gents periodically   tried to engage the widows in conversation. Their efforts, with yellow   glints of false teeth and melancholy sightings of slicked-down vestiges   of hair beneath the doffed berets, were invariably and contemptuously   ignored. To these elderly beaux, Max Ophuls was an affront, the ladies&#8217;   interest in him a humiliation. They would have killed him if they   could, if they had not been too busy staving off their own deaths.<br><br>    India saw it all, the exhibitionist, desirous old women pirouetting and   flirting on the verandahs, the lurking, spiteful old men. The antique   Russian super, Olga Simeonovna, a bulbous denim-clad samovar of a   woman, was greeting the ambassador as if he were a visiting head of   state. If there had been a red carpet on the premises she would have   rolled it out for him.<br><br>    &#8220;She keeps you waiting, Mr. Ambassador, what you gonna do, the young. I   say nothing against. Just, a daughter these days is more difficult, I   was a daughter myself who for me my father was like a god, to keep him   waiting unthinkable. Alas, daughters today are hard to raise and then   they leave you flat. I sir am formerly mother, but now they are dead to   me, my girls. I spit on their forgotten names. This is how it is.&#8221;
