		<p><b>Saugatuck, Minnesota<br>
Thursday, July 28, 1988</b></p>

<p>"Matthew Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"This is Sheriff Cliff Brandt of Sweetwater County, Wyoming.
Are you married to a Gwen Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>". . . Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"And she drives a white Toyota Tercel, this year's model,
Minnesota license number four-four-three-B-C-Y?"</p>

<p>"That's correct. What's this about, Sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Her car was found in my jurisdiction, parked by the side of
County Road Eleven, eight miles from Reliance. That's a farming community north
of Interstate Eighty. Nothing wrong with the vehicle, but there were
bloodstains on the dash and other signs consistent with a struggle. A purse
containing her identification and credit cards was on the passenger's seat."</p>

<p>"And Gwen? What about Gwen?"</p>

<p>"No sign of her. Tell me, Mr. Lindstrom, does she know
anyone in Reliance? Or Sweetwater County?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know, she's never been to Wyoming."</p>

<p>"When did you last see Mrs. Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago, on the fourteenth."</p>

<p>"Two <i>weeks</i> ago? And you've got no idea where she's been
since then?"</p>

<p>"We're separated. Have filed for divorce. We met on the
fourteenth to go over the property settlement."</p>

<p>"I see. Messy divorce?"</p>

<p>"Amicable. We have no children and very little in the way of
assets."</p>

<p>"There was a student ID from Saugatuck College in your
wife's purse."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's a senior in the journalism department."</p>

<p>"And what do you do, Mr. Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>"I teach photography there, operate a small studio on the
side. Mostly wedding portraits, that sort of&#151; Why are you asking me these questions?
And what are you doing to find Gwen?"</p>

<p>"Just familiarizing myself with the situation. I take it you
can account for your whereabouts during the past two weeks?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can! I was here in Saugatuck, teaching summer courses.
Now, what are you doing to find&#151;"</p>

<p>"Don't get all exercised, Mr. Lindstrom. My last question
was strictly routine. As for finding your wife, we plan to circularize her photograph,
but we're hoping you can provide a better likeness than the one on her driver's
license."</p>

<p>"I'll overnight several to you. If you find her, will you
please ask her to call me? Or if . . ."</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> Mr. Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>"Well, if something's happened to her . . ."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. We'll be in touch."</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Thousand Springs, Nevada<br>
Thursday, July 28, 1988</b></p>

<p>"That's a bad place to hitchhike. Somebody could pick
you off coming around the curve. Where're you headed?"</p>

<p>"West. Where're you going?"</p>

<p>"All the way to Soledad County, California."</p>

<p>"Good a place as any, I guess. If you'd like some company .
. ."</p>

<p>"Hop in."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I really appreciate it. I was starting to get
spooked, all alone here."</p>

<p>"Why were you alone, anyway?"</p>

<p>"My last ride dropped me off. I kind of . . . had trouble
with him."</p>

<p>"That'll happen. Hitching's not the safest way for a woman
to travel."</p>

<p>"I know, but it's the only way I've got."</p>

<p>"How long have you been on the road?"</p>

<p>"A couple of days."</p>

<p>"Coming from where?"</p>

<p>"East. What's this place&#151;Soledad County&#151;like?"</p>

<p>"Pretty. Coast, forest, foothills, small towns."</p>

<p>"Lots of people live there?"</p>

<p>"No. We're one of the most sparsely populated in the upper
half of the state. Isolated, too; it's a four-hour drive to San Francisco, even
longer to Sacramento because of bad roads."</p>

<p>"Sounds nice."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got to like the quiet life, and I do. I live
in the country, near a little town called Cyanide Wells."</p>

<p>"So you think Soledad County is really a good place to
live?"</p>

<p>"If you want, I'll sing its praises all the way there. By
the way, my name's Carly McGuire."</p>

<p>"Mine's Ardis Coleman."</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Port Regis, British Columbia<br>

Sunday, April 21, 2002</b></p>

<p>Matthew Lindstrom?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'm calling about your wife."</p>

<p>"I have no wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do. Gwen Lindstrom&#151;"</p>

<p>"My wife disappeared fourteen years ago. Our divorce went through
shortly after that."</p>

<p>"I know, Mr. Lindstrom. And I know about your legal and
professional difficulties surrounding the situation. They must have been very
painful. Put an end to your life as you'd known it, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Who is this?"</p>

<p>"A friend. My identity's not important. What's important is
that your wife is very much alive. And very cognizant of what she put you through
when she disappeared."</p>

<p>"Listen, whoever you are&#151;"</p>

<p>"Aren't you curious? I'm sure I would be if I were you."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go along with your game. Where is Gwen?"</p>

<p>"Soledad County, California. Has lived there for the past
fourteen years near a place called Cyanide Wells, under the name of Ardis
Coleman."</p>

<p>"Ardis Coleman? My God, that was Gwen's mother's maiden
name."</p>

<p>"Well, there you go. Let me ask you this, Mr. Lindstrom:
Will revenge taste good served up cold, after the passage of all those years?"</p>

<p>"Revenge?"</p>

<p>"Surely you must feel some impulse in that direction,
considering . . ."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you trying to do to me? Who <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"As I said, a friend."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of this!"</p>

<p>"Then I suggest you check it out, Mr. Lindstrom. Check it
out."</p>

<br><br>

<p><b>Cyanide Wells, California<br>
Sunday, April 21, 2002</b></p>

<p>"Hey, Ard, you're awfully quiet. Something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I can pin down, but I feel . . . I didn't sleep
well last night. Bad dreams, the kind you can't remember afterwards, but their
aura lingers like a hangover."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's your book. It can't be easy reliving that time.
And from what I've read, it's a much more personal account than what you wrote
for the paper."</p>

<p>"It is, but that's how I want it, Carly. Besides, I don't
think this is about the book&#151;at least not completely."</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"Matt, maybe."</p>

<p>"After all these years?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of him a lot lately. Wondering . . ."</p>

<p>"And feeling guilty, I suppose."</p>

<p>"In a way. When I found out they suspected him of murdering
me, I should've come forward."</p>

<p>"You found out way after the fact. And when you did try to
contact him, he was gone, no forwarding."</p>

<p>"I know, but instead of trying to find out where he'd gone,
I just felt relieved. I didn't want to hurt him any more than I already had."</p>

<p>"So he's better off."</p>

<p>"No, he'd've been better off if I'd been honest from the
first. I could've&#151;"</p>

<p>"As my aunt Nan used to say, '<i>Coulda</i>'s, <i>woulda</i>'s, and <i>shoulda</i>'s
don't amount to a hill of beans.'"</p>

<p>"I guess. But I'm concerned for Natalie. My anxiety's
obvious, and it upsets her."</p>

<p>"She hasn't said anything about it to me."</p>

<p>"You know her; she's a child who holds everything inside.
Carly, d'you think I'm being irrational?"</p>

<p>". . . You're stressed. You'll get over it once the book is
done."</p>

<p>"Will I? Sometimes I think that given all the terrible
things I've done, I don't deserve another good night's sleep in this lifetime."
