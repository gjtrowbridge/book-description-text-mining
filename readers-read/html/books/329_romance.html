<p align="center"><i><b>Chapter
One</b></i></p>
<p>Five o'clock sharp. <i>"Ponctualitï¿½ est la politesse des rois"</i>:
Rudy quoting his late father, a factory owner (textiles) in Vienna
before the Nazis came. The Pope's phone call, followed by the grinding
of the ice, a growling, workmanlike sound, a lot like Rudy's own sound,
compliments of the GE model Rudy had picked out fourteen years ago when
they built this house. <i>Gr-runnch, gr-runnch, grr-rr-runnch</i>.
("And look! It even has this tray you pull down to mix the drinks."
Rudy retained the enthusiasms of childhood.) He built Christina's drink
with loving precision after the Pope's call. Rudy did the high Polish
voice, overlaid with an Italian accent: "Thees is John Paul. My
cheeldren, eet is cocktail time."</p>
<p>Or sometimes Christina's study phone would not ring. Rudy simply
emerged from his studio below and called brusquely up to her in his
basso profundo: "Hello? The Pope just called. Are you ready for a
drink?"</p>
<p>The ominous rolled <i>r's</i> on the "ready" and "drink": if you're
not, you'd better be. I won't be here forever, you know.</p>
<p>The cavalier slosh of Bombay Sapphire (Rudy never measured) over the
ice shards. The <i>fssst</i> as he loosened the seltzer cap and added
the self-respecting splash that made her able to call it a gin and
soda. Then, marching over to the sink: "I need Ralph." Ralph was their
best serrated knife. The thinly cut slice of lime oozed fresh juice.
Rudy cut well; he cut his own music paper, and he had been cutting
Christina's hair exactly as she liked it for twenty-eight years. And in
summer, a sprig of mint from the garden, a hairy, pungent variety given
to them by the wife of a pianist who had recorded Rudy's music.
Sometimes Rudy joined Christina in the gin and soda. Her financial man
from Buffalo had given them two twelve-ounce tumblers with
old-fashioned ticker tapes etched into the surfaces. She always kept
them in the freezer, so they would frost up as soon as they hit the air.</p>
<p>Other times Rudy would say, "I need a Scotch tonight." That went
into a different glass, a lovely cordial shape etched with grapes,
given to him by the daughter of a pasha who had invited him to her
houseboat parties in Cairo back in '42 and called him Harpo because his
assignment in the Royal Air Force had been playing piano and harp to
keep up troop morale. "I need a Scotch tonight" could mean either that
his work had gone extremely well or that some unwelcome aspect of
reality (his music publisher sending back sloppily edited orchestra
parts, being put on hold by his health insurance provider, being put on
hold by anyone at all) had undermined his creative momentum.</p>
<p>"Thees is Il Papa calling from the Vatican. Cheeldren, eet is
cocktail time."</p>
<p>Christina was a cradle Episcopalian who had gone to a Catholic
school run by a French order of nuns in North Carolina. Rudy was a
nonpracticing Jew who had gone to a Catholic <i>Gymnasium</i> in
Vienna until age fourteen, when the Nazis came. Rudy always liked to
tell how there were two Jews and one Protestant in his class at the <i>Gymnasium</i>,
"and the Protestant had the worst of it by far." So Rudy and Christina
shared an affectionate fascination with Popes, especially this one,
with his hulking masculine shoulders before they began to stoop, and
his nonstop traveling, and all the languages.</p>
<p><i>What did I think, that we had forever?</i> Christina asked
herself, sipping the gin and soda she now made for herself. Often Rudy
had interrupted himself in midsentence to explode at her: "You're <i>not</i>
listening!"</p>
<p><i>What was I listening to? The ups and downs of my own day's
momentum. We were both "ah-tists," as the real estate lady who sold us
our first house pronounced it. She herself had been married to an
ah-tist. Her husband's novel had been runner-up for the Pulitzer, she
told us, the year</i> Anthony Adverse <i>won. Her name was Odette, as
in Swann's downfall. Rudy was fifty-two and I was thirty-nine and
neither of us knew, until Odette carefully explained it to us, that you
could buy a house without having all the money to pay for it up front.</i></p>
<p>Christina would arrange herself on the black leather sofa they had
splurged on in their midlife prosperity (a combined windfall of a
bequest from Rudy's late uncle in Lugano, with whom Rudy had played
chess, and a lucrative two-book contract for Christina, in those bygone
days when there were enough competing publishers to run up the auction
bid) and which the Siamese cats had ruined within six months. She would
cross her ankles on the Turkish cushions on top of the burled-wood
coffee table and train her myopic gaze on Rudy's long craggy face and
crest of white hair floating reassuringly from his Stickley armchair on
the other side of the fireplace. An editor had once told Rudy he looked
like "a happy Beckett." Christina felt rich in her bounty: the workday
was over and she had this powerful companion pulsing his attention at
her, and her whole drink to go. They raised their cocktail glasses to
each other.
