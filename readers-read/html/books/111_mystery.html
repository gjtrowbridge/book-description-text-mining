<P><B>EIGHT YEARS LATER</B></P>
<br>
<P>The motorcade streamed into the tree-shaded parking lot,
where it disgorged numerous people who looked hot, tired
and genuinely unhappy. The miniature army marched toward the
ugly white brick building. The structure had been many things in
its time and currently housed a decrepit funeral home that was
thriving solely because there was no other such facility within
thirty miles and the dead, of course, had to go somewhere. Appropriately
somber gentlemen in black suits stood next to hearses of
the same color. A few bereaved trickled out the door, sobbing quietly
into handkerchiefs. An old man in a tattered suit that was too
large for him and wearing a battered, oily Stetson sat on a bench
outside the front entrance, whittling. It was just that sort of a place,
rural to the hilt, stock car racing and bluegrass ballads forever.</P>

<P>The old fellow looked up curiously as the procession passed by
with a tall, distinguished-looking man ceremoniously in the middle.
The elderly gent just shook his head and grinned at this spectacle,
showing the few tobacco-stained teeth he had left. Then he
took a nip of refreshment from a flask pulled from his pocket and
returned to his artful wood carving.</P>

<P>The woman, in her early thirties and dressed in a black pantsuit,
was in step behind the tall man. In the past her heavy pistol in the
belt holster had scraped uncomfortably against her side, causing a
scab. As a solution she'd sewn an extra layer of cloth into her blouses
at that spot and learned to live with any lingering irritation. She'd
overheard some of her men joke that all female agents should wear
double shoulder holsters because it gave them a buxom look without
expensive breast enhancement. Yes, testosterone was alive and
well in her world.</P>

<P>Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell was on the extreme fast
track. She was not yet at the White House detail, guarding the president
of the United States, but she was close. Barely nine years in
the Service, and she was already a protection detail leader. Most
agents spent a decade in the field doing investigative work before
even graduating to protection detail as shift agents, yet Michelle
Maxwell was used to getting to places before other folks.</P>

<P>This was her big preview before almost certain reassignment to
the White House, and she was worried. This was an unscheduled
stop, and that meant no advance team and limited backup. Yet because
it was a last-minute change in plan, the plus side was no one
could know they were going to be there.</P>

<P>They reached the entrance, and Michelle put a firm hand on the
tall man's arm and told him to wait while they scoped things out.
The place was quiet, smelled of death and despair in quiet pockets
of misery centered on coffins in each of the viewing rooms. She
posted agents at various key points along the man's path: "giving
feet" as it was called in Service parlance. Properly done, the simple
act of having a professional with a gun and communication capability
standing in a doorway could work wonders.</P>

<P>She spoke into her walkie-talkie, and the tall man, John Bruno,
was brought in. She led him down the hallway as gazes from the
viewing rooms wandered to them. A politician and his entourage on
the campaign trail were like a herd of elephants: they could travel
nowhere lightly. They stomped the earth until it hurt with the
weight of the guards, chiefs of staff, spokespersons, speechwriters,
publicity folks, gofers and others. It was a spectacle that if it didn't
make you laugh would at least cause you considerable worry about
the future of the country.</P>

<P>John Bruno was running for the office of president of the United
States, and he had absolutely no chance of winning. Looking far
younger than his fifty-six years, he was an independent candidate
who'd used the support of a small but strident percentage of the
electorate fed up with just about everything mainstream to qualify
for each state's national ballot. Thus, he'd been given Secret Service
protection, though not at the staffing level of a bona fide contender.
It was Michelle Maxwell's job to keep him alive until the election.
She was counting the days.</P>

<P>Bruno was a former iron-balls prosecutor, and he'd made a great
number of enemies, only some of whom were currently behind bars.
His political planks were fairly simple. He'd tell you he wanted government
off the backs of the people and free enterprise to rule. As for
the poor and weak, those not up to the task of unfettered competition,
well, in all other species the weak died and the strong prevailed,
and why should it be any different for us? Largely because of that position, the man had no chance of winning. Although America loved
its tough guys, they weren't ready to vote for leaders who exhibited
no compassion for the downtrodden and miserable, for on any given
day they might constitute a majority.</P>

<P>The trouble started when Bruno entered the room trailed by his
chief of staff, two aides, Michelle and three of her men. The widow
sitting in front of her husband's coffin looked up sharply. Michelle
couldn't see her expression through the veil the woman was wearing
but assumed her look was one of surprise at seeing this herd of
interlopers invading hallowed ground. The old woman got up and
retreated to a corner, visibly shaking.</P>

<P>The candidate whirled on Michelle. "He was a dear friend of
mine," Bruno snapped, "and I am not going to parade in with an
army. Get out," he added tersely.</P>


<P>"I'll stay," she fired back. "Just me."
He shook his head. They'd had many such standoffs. He knew
that his candidacy was a hopeless long shot, and that just made him
try even harder. The pace had been brutal, the protection logistics
a nightmare.</P>

<P>"No, this is private!" he growled. Bruno looked over at the quivering
woman in the corner. "My God, you're scaring her to death.
This is repugnant."</P>

<P>Michelle went back one more time to the well. He refused yet
again, leading them all out of the room, berating them as he did.
What the hell could happen to him in a funeral home? Was the
eighty-year-old widow going to jump him? Was the dead man going
to come back to life? Michelle sensed that her protectee was
really upset because she was costing him valuable campaign time.
Yet it wasn't her idea to come here. However, Bruno was in no
mood to hear that.</P>

<P>No chance to win, and the man acted like he was king of the hill.
Of course, on election day the voters, including Michelle, would kick
his butt right out the door.</P>

<P>As a compromise Michelle asked for two minutes to sweep the
room. This was granted, and her men moved quickly to do so while
she silently fumed, telling herself that she had to save her ammo for
the really important battles.</P>

<P>Her men came out 120 seconds later and reported everything
okay. Only one door in and out. No windows. Old lady and dead
guy the only occupants. It was cool. Not perfect, but okay. Michelle
nodded at her candidate. Bruno could have his private face time,
and then they could get out of here.</P>

<P>Inside the viewing room, Bruno closed the door behind him and
walked over to the open coffin. There was another coffin against the
far wall; it was also open, but empty. The deceased's coffin was resting
on a raised platform with a white skirting that was surrounded
waist-high with an assortment of beautiful flowers. Bruno paid his
respects to the body lying there, murmuring, "So long, Bill," as he
turned to the widow, who'd returned to her chair. He knelt in front
of her, gently held one of her hands.</P>

<P>"I'm so sorry, Mildred, so very sorry. He was a good man."
The bereaved looked up at him from behind the veil, smiled and
then looked down again. Bruno's expression changed and he
looked around, though the only other occupant of the room was in
no condition to eavesdrop. "Now, you mentioned something else
you wanted to talk about. In private."</P>

<P>"Yes," the widow said in a very low voice.
"I'm afraid I don't have much time, Mildred. What is it?"
In answer she placed a hand on his cheek, and then her fingers
touched his neck. Bruno grimaced as he felt the sharp prick against
his skin, and then he slipped to the floor unconscious.
