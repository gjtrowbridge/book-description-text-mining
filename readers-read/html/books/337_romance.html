<H4 align=center>Chapter One</H4>
                  <P><I>England, 1825</I></P>
                  <P>The Malory clan always spent the Christmas holidays at
                  Haverston, the ancestral estate in the country where the
                  oldest among them had been born and raised. Jason Malory,
                  Third Marquis of Haverston and the oldest of four brothers,
                  was the only family member who was still a permanent resident.
                  The head of the family since he was only sixteen, Jason had
                  raised his brothers -- two of whom had been utterly scandalous
                  in their pursuits -- and a young sister.</P>
                  <P>At present the various Malorys and offspring were quite
                  numerous and difficult to place, sometimes even for Jason
                  himself. So it was a very large brood that gathered at
                  Haverston these days for the Christmas season.</P>
                  <P>Jason's only son and heir, Derek, was the first to arrive,
                  more than a week before Christmas. With him came his wife,
                  Kelsey, and Jason's first two blond and green-eyed
                  grandchildren.</P>
                  <P>Anthony, his youngest brother, was the next to arrive only
                  a few days after Derek. Tony, as most of the family called
                  him, admitted to Jason that he'd deserted London early after
                  hearing that their brother James had a bone to pick with him.
                  Annoying James was one thing, and something Anthony often
                  strived to do, but when James was out for blood, well, Tony
                  considered that a different matter entirely.</P>
                  <P>Anthony and James were his youngest brothers, yet only a
                  year apart in age themselves. They were both skilled
                  pugilists, and Anthony could hold his own with the best of
                  them, yet James was heftier, and his fists were frequently
                  likened to solid bricks.</P>
                  <P>With Anthony came his wife, Roslynn, and their two
                  daughters. Judith, the oldest at six, had taken after both her
                  parents, having her mother's glorious red-gold hair and her
                  father's cobalt blue eyes, a seriously striking combination
                  that Anthony feared was going to make her the reigning beauty
                  of her day -- which as her father and a reformed rake he was
                  not looking forward to.</P>
                  <P>But his younger daughter, Jaime, was going to break some
                  hearts as well.</P>
                  <P>But even with all his guests, Jason was the first one to
                  notice the present that had appeared in the parlor while the
                  family was breakfasting. It was hard to miss, actually, placed
                  prominently up on a pedestal table next to the fireplace.
                  Wrapped in gold cloth, banded with a red velvet ribbon and
                  bow, it was oddly shaped, nearly like the size of a thick
                  book, yet a round protrusion on top suggested it was nothing
                  that simple.</P>
                  <P>Poking a finger at it showed that the protrusion could
                  move, yet not very much, as he found out when he tilted the
                  present sideways and it didn't change position. Strange, yet
                  stranger still was that there was no indication of whom the
                  present was from, nor whom it was for.</P>
                  <P>"A bit early to be passing out Christmas gifts, ain't it?"
                  Anthony remarked as he sauntered into the room to find Jason
                  holding the present. "The Christmas tree ain't even been
                  brought in yet."</P>
                  <P>"That was my thought as well, since I didn't put it here,"
                  Jason replied.</P>
                  <P>"No? Then who?"</P>
                  <P>"I've no idea," Jason admitted.</P>
                  <P>"Who's it for, then?" Anthony asked.</P>
                  <P>"I'd like to know that myself."</P>
                  <P>Anthony raised a brow at that point. "No card?"</P>
                  <P>Jason shook his head. "None. I just found it here on this
                  pedestal myself," he said, and put it back.</P>
                  <P>Anthony picked up the present as well to poke at it a bit.
                  "Hmmm, someone sure dressed it up fancy. I'll wager it will
                  fascinate the children -- at least until we find out what it
                  is."</P>
                  <P>As it happened, it fascinated the adults as well. In the
                  following days, since none of the family owned up to having
                  put it there, the present created a sensation. Just about all
                  of the adults poked, shook, or otherwise examined it, yet no
                  one could figure out what it might be, or whom it was for.</P>
                  <P>Those having arrived so far were gathered in the parlor the
                  night when Amy walked in holding one of her twins. "Don't ask
                  why we're late, you wouldn't believe it," she said, then in
                  the next breath, "First the wheel on the coach fell off. Then
                  not a mile down the road, one of the horses lost not one, but
                  two of his shoes. After we finally get that all taken care of
                  and we're almost here, the bloody axle broke. I thought surely
                  Warren was going to kill that poor coach by then. He certainly
                  kicked it enough. If I didn't think to wager with him that we
                  would arrive here today, I really don't think we would have.
                  But you know I never lose a wager, so ... By the by, Uncle
                  Jason, what's an unmarked grave doing in that lovely clearing
                  east of here? The one close to the road that runs through your
                  property? We ended up walking through it to get here, since it
                  was the shorter route by that point, to just head across that
                  clearing."</P>
                  <P>No one said a word at first, still in bemusement after that
                  long dissertation. But then Derek said, "Remember that grave
                  m'self, now that you mention it, cousin. Reggie and I came
                  across it when we were younguns gadding about the estate.
                  Always meant to ask you about it, Father, just never got
                  around to it, then forgot about it."</P>
                  <P>They were all looking toward Jason by then, but he merely
                  shrugged his broad shoulders. "Devil if I know who was laid to
                  rest there. That grave has been there since before I was born.
                  Asked my father about it once, as I recall, but he put off
                  answering, hemmed and hawed so much, actually, that I figured
                  he just didn't know, so I didn't ask again."
