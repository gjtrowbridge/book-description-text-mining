<P><I>The Hospital, somewhere in Maryland</I></P>
     <br>


<P>At about eleven in the evening, Dr. Ethan Kane trudged down the
gray-and-blue-painted corridor toward a private elevator.
         His mind
was filled with images of death and suffering, but also progress, great
progress that would change the world.
      </P>


      <P>A
young and quite homely scrub nurse rounded the corner of the passageway and
nodded her head deferentially as she approached
         him. She had a
crush on Dr. Kane, and she wasn&#8217;t the only one.
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re still
working.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Esther, <I>you</I> go
home, now. Please,&#8221; Ethan Kane said, pretending to be solicitous and
caring, which couldn&#8217;t have been further from the
         truth. He
considered the nurse inferior in every way, including the fact that she was
female.
      </P>


      <P>He was also exhausted from a
surgical marathon: five major operations in a day. The elevator car finally
arrived, the doors
         slid open, and he stepped inside.
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;Good night, Esther,&#8221; he said, and showed the
nurse a lot of very white teeth, but no genuine warmth, because there was
none
         to show.
      </P>


      <P>He straightened
his tall body and wearily passed his hand over his longish blond hair,
cleaned his wire-rimmed glasses on
         the tail of his lab coat, then
rubbed his eyes before putting his glasses back on as he descended to the
subbasement level.
      </P>


      <P><I>One more thing to
check on . . . always one more thing to do.</I></P>



<P>He walked half a dozen quick steps to a thick steel door and pushed it
open with the palm of his hand.</P>


      <P>He entered the
dark and chilly atmosphere of a basement storage room. A pungent odor
struck him.</P>


      <P>There, lying on a double row of
gurneys, were six naked bodies. Four men, two women, all in their late
teens and early twenties.
         Each was brain-dead, each as good as
gone, but each had served a worthy cause, a higher purpose. The plastic
bracelets on
         their wrists said DONOR.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;You&#8217;re making the world a better place,&#8221; Kane
whispered as he passed the bodies. &#8220;Take comfort in that.&#8221;</P>



      <P>Dr. Kane strode to the far end of the room and pushed open
another steel door, an exact duplicate of the first. This time

rather than a chilly blast, he was met by a searing wave of hot air, the
deafening roar of fire, and the unmistakable smell
         of death.

</P>


      <P>All three incinerators were going tonight. Two
of his nighttime porters, their powerful workingman bodies glistening with

grime and sweat, looked up as Dr. Kane entered the cinder-block chamber.
The men nodded respectfully, but their eyes showed
         fear.

</P>


      <P>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pick up the pace, gentlemen.
This is taking too long,&#8221; Kane called out. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go,
let&#8217;s go! You&#8217;re being paid well
         for this scut work.
Too well.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>He glanced at a naked
young woman&#8217;s corpse laid out on the cement floor. She was
white-blond, pretty in a music-video sort
         of way. The porters had
probably been diddling with her. That&#8217;s why they were behind
schedule, wasn&#8217;t it?
      </P>


      <P>Gurneys were
shoved haphazardly into one corner, like discarded shopping carts in a
supermarket parking lot. Quite a spectacle.
         <I>Hellish,</I> to be
sure.
      </P>


      <P>As he watched, one of the
sweat-glazed minions worked a wooden paddle under a young male&#8217;s body
while the other swung open
         the heavy glass door of an oven.
Together they pushed, shoved, slid the body into the fire as if it were a
pizza.
      </P>


      <P>The flames dampened for a moment,
then as the porters locked down the door, the inferno flared again. The
cremation chamber
         was called a &#8220;retort.&#8221; Each retort
burned at 3,600 degrees, and it took just over fifteen minutes to reduce a
human body to
         nothing but ashes.
      </P>



<P>To Dr. Ethan Kane, that meant one thing: no evidence of what was
happening at the Hospital. Absolutely no evidence of Resurrection.</P>



      <P>&#8220;Pick up the pace!&#8221; he yelled again.
&#8220;Burn these bodies!&#8221;</P>


      <P><I>The
donors.</I></P>
