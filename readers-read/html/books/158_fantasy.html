                                                    didn&#8217;t look dangerous,
                                                    not at first glance. Still,
                                                    a girl can never be too careful
                                                    on a blind date, and that&#8217;s
                                                    why I&#8217;d insisted Mr.
                                                    Sand meet me in a popular
                                                    steak house nestled in a casino
                                                    dead center on the Las Vegas
                                                    strip.

 It was, I&#8217;d thought,
                                                    the most public of all public
                                                    places. Yet now, watching
                                                    the way shadows from the muted
                                                    lighting sought out the unhealthy
                                                    hollows beneath his eyes and
                                                    cheeks, and the way he toyed
                                                    with his blue cheese and endive
                                                    appetizer &#8211; identical
                                                    to the one I&#8217;d scarfed
                                                    down in seconds &#8211; I
                                                    decided the most ominous thing
                                                    about Mr. Sand was a deeply
                                                    embedded issue with self-control,
                                                    and the only thing I was in
                                                    danger of dying from was boredom.
                                                    Of course, that was before
                                                    I really knew him. And before
                                                    my death the very next day.

                                                    At least this one could walk

                                                    his bony elbows rose to rest
                                                    on the table only to drop
                                                    a second later, and his eyes
                                                    darted around the dining room,
                                                    taking in everything but never
                                                    fully settling. I&#8217;d
                                                    like to still those relentless
                                                    limbs with my camera, I decided.
                                                    Take time to study those shifting
                                                    eyes. See just who Mr. Sand
                                                    became when seen in two dimensions
                                                    instead of three.</font></p>

                                                    was nearly transparent, but
                                                    more the way they tried to
                                                    own me. I licked my lips,
                                                    and they dropped to watch
                                                    my tongue dart out. I ran
                                                    a hand through my bobbed hair,
                                                    and felt him following the
                                                    movement so that my fingers
                                                    fisted there. I exhaled deeply,
                                                    forcing myself to relax, and
                                                    for some reason that made
                                                    him smile. </font></p>

                                                    there. It was like the still

                                                    in his skin. A warrior living

                                                    in my mind. The table wasn&#8217;t

                                                    I did know one thing, though.

                                                    cruel, possibly insane, and

                                                    a slow sip from his glass
                                                    of wine, swirling it languidly
                                                    in its crystal bowl. I watched,
                                                    transfixed by a single blood-red
                                                    drop studding his pale bottom
                                                    lip. The lips moved. </font></p>

                                                    It was toxic decay, a concentration

                                                    his while trying to process
                                                    what my nose was telling me.
                                                    It was him. He was somehow

                                                    before, told me he was dead

                                                    creamy white nape. Her back
                                                    was to us, her head momentarily
                                                    tilted back in a soundless
                                                    laugh. With that thin barbed
                                                    blade, Ajax could rend the
                                                    tendons from her neck before
                                                    she&#8217;d even caught her
                                                    next breath. </font></p>

                                                    away. It was the smile of
                                                    a person never touched by
                                                    violence, a look I&#8217;d

                                                    but still I didn&#8217;t move.
                                                    He growled, and it was an
                                                    expectant, warning sound.</font></p>

                                                    I said, as his muscles tensed.
                                                    He stared back at me with

                                                    it. He&#8217;d have killed

                                                    and the man across from her

                                                    pushed away from the table
                                                    and rose, my eyes never leaving
                                                    his. But then I did something

                                                    it to my lips. </font></p>

                                                    it was the intensity of the
                                                    moment, or maybe Ajax&#8217;s
                                                    lesson in odorous acuity really
                                                    had hit home, but the flavors
                                                    I inhaled from that glass
                                                    were the most complex, the
                                                    most vibrant, and the richest
                                                    I&#8217;d ever tasted. I could
                                                    scent the clay of the plateau
                                                    vineyard in France where the
                                                    fruit had been harvested,
                                                    and somehow I knew the grapes
                                                    had been picked on a windless,
                                                    rainy day. The juice had been
                                                    aged in French oak, and the
                                                    winemaker had regularly tested
                                                    the barrel with a steel ladle,
                                                    his artist&#8217;s palate
                                                    telling him when, exactly,
                                                    to go to bottle. Inhaling
                                                    all these things, things I
                                                    had no right to sense or see,
                                                    they became a part of me,
                                                    their knowledge burrowing
                                                    into my bones. </font></p>

                                                    drank deeply, almost ecstatically,
                                                    like the saints you see on
                                                    the ceilings of cathedrals,
                                                    the martyrs looking expectantly
                                                    toward heaven in their final,
                                                    lingering moments on earth.
                                                    All the while Ajax watched
                                                    me with those glassy death-eyes,
                                                    like he could tell exactly
                                                    what I was doing and feeling
                                                    and tasting. I lowered the
                                                    glass, as he had done earlier,
                                                    then blew in his direction.</font></p>
                                                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He
                                                    froze, alarm furrowing his
                                                    brow. I don&#8217;t know what
                                                    he scented of me just then,
                                                    but it wasn&#8217;t the fear
                                                    he so clearly expected. Still,
                                                    he regained his composure
                                                    quickly, and jerked his head
                                                    toward the exit. Unwilling
                                                    to let go of the wine that
                                                    still held so much life and
                                                    passion and vitality in it,
                                                    I turned with it still in
                                                    my hand. Then, fingering the
                                                    stem like a nun with her favorite
                                                    rosary beads, I slowly made
                                                    my way out the door.</font>
