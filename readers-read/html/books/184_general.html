is a story about a man</span> named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie
dying in the sun. It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all
endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
last hour</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Eddie's life
was spent, like most of the others, at Ruby Pier, an amusement park by a great
gray ocean. The park had the usual attractions, a boardwalk, a Ferris wheel,
roller coasters, bumper cars, a taffy stand, and an arcade where you could shoot
streams of water into a clown's mouth. It also had a big new ride called
Freddy's Free Fall, and this would be where Eddie would be killed, in an
accident that would make newspapers around the state.</font></p>
<p class="spbk-topofpage"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At
the time</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his death, Eddie
was a squat, white-haired old man, with a short neck, a barrel chest, thick
forearms, and a faded army tattoo on his right shoulder. His legs were thin and
veined now, and his left knee, wounded in the war, was ruined by arthritis. He
used a cane to get around. His face was broad and craggy from the sun, with
salty whiskers and a lower jaw that protruded slightly, making him look prouder
than he felt. He kept a cigarette behind his left ear and a ring of keys hooked
to his belt. He wore rubber-soled shoes. He wore an old linen cap. His pale
brown uniform suggested a workingman, and a workingman he was.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie's
job was</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;maintaining&quot;
the rides, which really meant keeping them safe. Every afternoon, he walked the
park, checking on each attraction, from the Tilt-A-Whirl to the Pipeline Plunge.
He looked for broken boards, loose bolts, worn-out steel. Sometimes he would
stop, his eyes glazing over, and people walking past thought something was
wrong. But he was listening, that's all. After all these years he could hear
trouble, he said, in the spits and stutters and thrumming of the equipment.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">W</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span class="spbkcaps">ith
50 minutes </span>left on earth, Eddie took his last walk along Ruby Pier. He
passed an elderly couple.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Folks,&quot; he mumbled,
touching his cap.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They nodded politely.
Customers knew Eddie. At least the regular ones did. They saw him summer after
summer, one of those faces you associate with a place. His work shirt had a
patch on the chest that read <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Eddie</span>
above the word <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Maintenance</span>, and
sometimes they would say, &quot;Hiya, Eddie Maintenance,&quot; although he never
thought that was funny.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, it so happened, was
Eddie's birthday, his 83rd. A doctor, last week, had told him he had shingles.
Shingles? Eddie didn't even know what they were. Once, he had been strong
enough to lift a carousel horse in each arm. That was a long time ago.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;<span style="mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ascii-font-family:Verdana;mso-hansi-font-family:Verdana" class="spbkcaps">Eddie</span>!&quot;
. . . &quot;<span style="mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-ascii-font-family:
Verdana;mso-hansi-font-family:Verdana" class="spbkcaps">Take</span> <span style="mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-ascii-font-family:Verdana;mso-hansi-font-family:
Verdana" class="spbkcaps">me</span>, Eddie!&quot; . . . &quot;Take me!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Forty minutes until his
death. Eddie made his way to the front of the roller coaster line. He rode every
attraction at least once a week, to be certain the brakes and steering were
solid. Today was coaster day -- the &quot;Ghoster Coaster&quot; they called this one
-- and the kids who knew Eddie yelled to get in the cart with him.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Children liked Eddie. Not
teenagers. Teenagers gave him headaches. Over the years, Eddie figured he'd
seen every sort of do-nothing, snarl-at-you teenager there was. But children
were different. Children looked at Eddie -- who, with his protruding lower jaw,
always seemed to be grinning, like a dolphin -- and they trusted him. They drew
in like cold hands to a fire. They hugged his leg. They played with his keys.
Eddie mostly grunted, never saying much. He figured it was because he didn't
say much that they liked him.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now Eddie tapped two little
boys with backward baseball caps. They raced to the cart and tumbled in. Eddie
handed his cane to the ride attendant and slowly lowered himself between the
two.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Here we go . . . . <i>Here
we go!</i> . . . &quot; one boy squealed, as the other pulled Eddie's arm around
his shoulder. Eddie lowered the lap bar and <i>clack-clack-clack</i>, up they
went.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A
story went</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> around about
Eddie. When he was a boy, growing up by this very same pier, he got in an alley
fight. Five kids from Pitkin Avenue had cornered his brother, Joe, and were
about to give him a beating. Eddie was a block away, on a stoop, eating a
sandwich. He heard his brother scream. He ran to the alley, grabbed a garbage
can lid, and sent two boys to the hospital.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After that, Joe didn't
talk to him for months. He was ashamed. Joe was the oldest, the firstborn, but
it was Eddie who did the fighting.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;<span style="mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-ascii-font-family:Verdana;mso-hansi-font-family:Verdana" class="spbkcaps">Can
we go</span> again, Eddie? <i>Please?</i>&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirty-four minutes to
live. Eddie lifted the lap bar, gave each boy a sucking candy, retrieved his
cane, then limped to the maintenance shop to cool down from the summer heat. Had
he known his death was imminent, he might have gone somewhere else. Instead, he
did what we all do. He went about his dull routine as if all the days in the
world were still to come.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the shop workers, a
lanky, bony-cheeked young man named Dominguez, was by the solvent sink, wiping
grease off a wheel.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yo, Eddie,&quot; he said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Dom,&quot; Eddie said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The shop smelled like
sawdust. It was dark and cramped with a low ceiling and pegboard walls that held
drills and saws and hammers. Skeleton parts of fun park rides were everywhere:
compressors, engines, belts, lightbulbs, the top of a pirate's head. Stacked
against one wall were coffee cans of nails and screws, and stacked against
another wall were endless tubs of grease.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Greasing a track, Eddie
would say, required no more brains than washing a dish; the only difference was
you got dirtier as you did it, not cleaner. And that was the sort of work that
Eddie did: spread grease, adjusted brakes, tightened bolts, checked electrical
panels. Many times he had longed to leave this place, find different work, build
another kind of life. But the war came. His plans never worked out. In time, he
found himself graying and wearing looser pants and in a state of weary
acceptance, that this was who he was and who he would always be, a man with sand
in his shoes in a world of mechanical laughter and grilled frankfurters. Like
his father before him, like the patch on his shirt, Eddie was maintenance -- the
head of maintenance -- or as the kids sometimes called him, &quot;the ride man at
Ruby Pier.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="spbk-topofpage"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirty
minutes left.</font></span></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Hey, happy birthday, I
hear,&quot; Dominguez said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie grunted.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;No party or nothing?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie looked at him as if
he were crazy. For a moment he thought how strange it was to be growing old in a
place that smelled of cotton candy.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Well, remember, Eddie, I'm off
next week, starting Monday. Going to Mexico.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie nodded, and Dominguez
did a little dance.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Me and Theresa. Gonna
see the whole family. Par-r-r-ty.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He stopped dancing when he
noticed Eddie staring.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You ever been?&quot;
Dominguez said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Been?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To Mexico?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie exhaled through his
nose. &quot;Kid, I never been anywhere I wasn't shipped to with a rifle.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He watched Dominguez return
to the sink. He thought for a moment. Then he took a small wad of bills from his
pocket and removed the only twenties he had, two of them. He held them out.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Get your wife something
nice,&quot; Eddie said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dominguez regarded the
money, broke into a huge smile, and said, &quot;C'mon, man. You sure?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie pushed the money into
Dominguez's palm. Then he walked out back to the storage area. A small &quot;fishing hole&quot; had been cut into the boardwalk planks years ago, and Eddie
lifted the plastic cap. He tugged on a nylon line that dropped 80 feet to the
sea. A piece of bologna was still attached.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We catch anything?&quot;
Dominguez yelled. &quot;Tell me we caught something!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie wondered how the guy
could be so optimistic. There was never anything on that line.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;One day,&quot; Dominguez
yelled, &quot;we're gonna get a halibut!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yep,&quot; Eddie mumbled,
although he knew you could never pull a fish that big through a hole that small.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Twenty-six
minutes</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to live. Eddie
crossed the boardwalk to the south end. Business was slow. The girl behind the
taffy counter was leaning on her elbows, popping her gum.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once, Ruby Pier was <i>the</i>
place to go in the summer. It had elephants and fireworks and marathon dance
contests. But people didn't go to ocean piers much anymore; they went to theme
parks where you paid<i> $75</i> a ticket and had your photo taken with a giant
furry character.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie limped past the
bumper cars and fixed his eyes on a group of teenagers leaning over the railing.
Great, he told himself. <i>Just what I need.</i></font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Off,&quot; Eddie said,
tapping the railing with his cane. &quot;C'mon. It's not safe.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The teens glared at him.
The car poles sizzled with electricity, <i>zzzap zzzap</i> sounds.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It's not safe,&quot;
Eddie repeated.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The teens looked at each
other. One kid, who wore a streak of orange in his hair, sneered at Eddie, then
stepped onto the middle rail.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Come on, dudes, hit
me!&quot; he yelled, waving at the young drivers. &quot;Hit m --&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie whacked the railing
so hard with his cane he almost snapped it in two. &quot;MOVE IT!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The teens ran away.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another
story went</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> around about
Eddie. As a soldier, he had engaged in combat numerous times. He'd been brave.
Even won a medal. But toward the end of his service, he got into a fight with
one of his own men. That's how Eddie was wounded. No one knew what happened to
the other guy.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No one asked.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
19 minutes</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> left on earth,
Eddie sat for the last time, in an old aluminum beach chair. His short, muscled
arms folded like a seal's flippers across his chest. His legs were red from
the sun, and his left knee still showed scars. In truth, much of Eddie's body
suggested a survived encounter. His fingers were bent at awkward angles, thanks
to numerous fractures from assorted machinery. His nose had been broken several
times in what he called &quot;saloon fights.&quot; His broadly jawed face might have
been good-looking once, the way a prizefighter might have looked before he took
too many punches.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now Eddie just looked
tired. This was his regular spot on the Ruby Pier boardwalk, behind the
Jackrabbit ride, which in the 1980s was the Thunderbolt, which in the 1970s was
the Steel Eel, which in the 1960s was the Lollipop Swings, which in the 1950s
was Laff In The Dark, and which before that was the Stardust Band Shell.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which was where Eddie met
Marguerite.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every
life has</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one true-love
snapshot. For Eddie, it came on a warm September night after a thunderstorm,
when the boardwalk was spongy with water. She wore a yellow cotton dress, with a
pink barrette in her hair. Eddie didn't say much. He was so nervous he felt as
if his tongue were glued to his teeth. They danced to the music of a big band,
Long Legs Delaney and his Everglades Orchestra. He bought her a lemon fizz. She
said she had to go before her parents got angry. But as she walked away, she
turned and waved.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That was the snapshot. For
the rest of his life, whenever he thought of Marguerite, Eddie would see that
moment, her waving over her shoulder, her dark hair falling over one eye, and he
would feel the same arterial burst of love.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That night he came home and
woke his older brother. He told him he'd met the girl he was going to marry.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Go to sleep,
Eddie,&quot; his brother groaned.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whrrrssssh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.
A wave broke on the beach. Eddie coughed up something he did not want to see. He
spat it away.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whrrssssssh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.
He used to think a lot about Marguerite. Not so much now. She was like a wound
beneath an old bandage, and he had grown more used to the bandage.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whrrssssssh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What was shingles?</font></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whrrrsssssh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sixteen minutes to live.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span class="spbkcaps">No
story sits</span> by itself. Sometimes stories meet at corners and sometimes
they cover one another completely, like stones beneath a river.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The end of Eddie's story
was touched by another seemingly innocent story, months earlier -- a cloudy
night when a young man arrived at Ruby Pier with three of his friends.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The young man, whose name
was Nicky, had just begun driving and was still not comfortable carrying a key
chain. So he removed the single car key and put it in his jacket pocket, then
tied the jacket around his waist.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the next few hours, he
and his friends rode all the fastest rides: the Flying Falcon, the Splashdown,
Freddy's Free Fall, the Ghoster Coaster.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Hands in the air!&quot; one
of them yelled.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They threw their hands in
the air.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Later, when it was dark,
they returned to the car lot, exhausted and laughing, drinking beer from brown
paper bags. Nicky reached into his jacket pocket. He fished around. He cursed.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The key was gone.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fourteen
minutes until</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his death.
Eddie wiped his brow with a handkerchief. Out on the ocean, diamonds of sunlight
danced on the water, and Eddie stared at their nimble movement. He had not been
right on his feet since the war.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But back at the Stardust
Band Shell with Marguerite -- there Eddie had still been graceful. He closed his
eyes and allowed himself to summon the song that brought them together, the one
Judy Garland sang in that movie. It mixed in his head now with the cacophony of
the crashing waves and children screaming on the rides.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You made me love you -- &quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whsssshhhh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font></p>

<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chhhhewisshhhh.</font></i></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot; -- knew it . . . &quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie felt her hands on his
shoulders. He squeezed his eyes tightly, to bring the memory closer.</font></p>
<p class="spbk-topofpage"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Twelve
minutes to</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> live.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'Scuse me.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A young girl, maybe eight
years old, stood before him, blocking his sunlight. She had blonde curls and
wore flip-flops and denim cutoff shorts and a lime green T-shirt with a cartoon
duck on the front. Amy, he thought her name was. Amy or Annie. She'd been here
a lot this summer, although Eddie never saw a mother or father.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'Scuuuse me,&quot; she
said again. &quot;Eddie Maint'nance?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie sighed. &quot;Just
Eddie,&quot; he said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Eddie?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Um hmm?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Can you make me . . .&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She put her hands together
as if praying.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;C'mon, kiddo. I don't have all
day.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Can you make me an animal? Can
you?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie looked up, as if he
had to think about it. Then he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out
three yellow pipe cleaners, which he carried for just this purpose.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yesssss!&quot; the little
girl said, slapping her hands.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie began twisting the
pipe cleaners.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Where's your parents?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Riding the rides.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Without you?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The girl shrugged. &quot;My mom's with
her boyfriend.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie looked up. Oh.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He bent the pipe cleaners
into several small loops, then twisted the loops around one another. His hands
shook now, so it took longer than it used to, but soon the pipe cleaners
resembled a head, ears, body, and tail.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A rabbit?&quot; the little
girl said.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie winked.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Thaaaank you!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She spun away, lost in that
place where kids don't even know their feet are moving. Eddie wiped his brow
again, then closed his eyes, slumped into the beach chair, and tried to get the
old song back into his head.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A seagull squawked as it
flew overhead.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">How
do people</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"> choose their final
words? Do they realize their gravity? Are they fated to be wise?</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By his 83rd birthday, Eddie
had lost nearly everyone he'd cared about. Some had died young, and some had
been given a chance to grow old before a disease or an accident took them away.
At their funerals, Eddie listened as mourners recalled their final
conversations. &quot;It's as if he knew he was going to die . . . . &quot; some
would say.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie never believed that.
As far as he could tell, when your time came, it came, and that was that. You
might say something smart on your way out, but you might just as easily say
something stupid.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the record, Eddie's
final words would be &quot;Get back!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="spbk-topofpage"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here
are the </font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana">sounds of Eddie's
last minutes on earth. Waves crashing. The distant thump of rock music. The
whirring engine of a small biplane, dragging an ad from its tail. And this.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;OH MY GOD! LOOK!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie felt his eyes dart
beneath his lids. Over the years, he had come to know every noise at Ruby Pier
and could sleep through them all like a lullaby.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This voice was not in the
lullaby.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;OH MY GOD! LOOK!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie bolted upright. A
woman with fat, dimpled arms was holding a shopping bag and pointing and
screaming. A small crowd gathered around her, their eyes to the skies.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie saw it immediately.
Atop Freddy's Free Fall, the new &quot;tower drop&quot; attraction, one of the carts
was tilted at an angle, as if trying to dump its cargo. Four passengers, two
men, two women, held only by a safety bar, were grabbing frantically at anything
they could.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; the fat woman yelled.
&quot;<span style="text-transform:uppercase">Those people! They're gonna fall</span>!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A voice squawked from the
radio on Eddie's belt. <i>&quot;Eddie! Eddie!&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He pressed the button. &quot;I see it!
Get security!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People ran up from the
beach, pointing as if they had practiced this drill. <i>Look! Up in the sky! An
amusement ride turned evil!</i> Eddie grabbed his cane and clomped to the safety
fence around the platform base, his wad of keys jangling against his hip. His
heart was racing.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Freddy's Free Fall was
supposed to drop two carts in a stomach-churning descent, only to be halted at
the last instant by a gush of hydraulic air. How did one cart come loose like
that? It was tilted just a few feet below the upper platform, as if it had
started downward then changed its mind.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie reached the gate and
had to catch his breath. Dominguez came running and nearly banged into him.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Listen to me!&quot; Eddie
said, grabbing Dominguez by the shoulders. His grip was so tight, Dominguez made
a pained face. &quot;Listen to me! Who's up there?&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Willie.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;OK. He must've hit the
emergency stop. That's why the cart is hanging. Get up the ladder and tell
Willie to manually release the safety restraint so those people can get out. OK?
It's on the back of the cart, so you're gonna have to hold him while he
leans out there. OK? Then . . . then, the two of ya's -- the two of ya's
now, not one, you got it? -- the two of ya's get them out! One holds the
other! Got it!? . . . <i>Got it?</i>&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dominguez nodded quickly.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then send that damn cart down so
we can figure out what happened!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie's head was
pounding. Although his park had been free of any major accidents, he knew the
horror stories of his business. Once, in Brighton, a bolt unfastened on a
gondola ride and two people fell to their death. Another time, in Wonderland
Park, a man had tried to walk across a roller coaster track; he fell through and
got stuck beneath his armpits. He was wedged in, screaming, and the cars came
racing toward him and . . . well, that was the worst.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie pushed that from his
mind. There were people all around him now, hands over their mouths, watching
Dominguez climb the ladder. Eddie tried to remember the insides of Freddy's
Free Fall. <i>Engine. Cylinders. Hydraulics.</i> Seals. Cables. How does a cart
come loose? He followed the ride visually, from the four frightened people at
the top, down the towering shaft, and into the base. <i>Engine. Cylinders.
Hydraulics. Seals. Cables </i>. . . .</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dominguez reached the upper
platform. He did as Eddie told him, holding Willie as Willie leaned toward the
back of the cart to release the restraint. One of the female riders lunged for
Willie and nearly pulled him off the platform. The crowd gasped.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Wait . . .&quot; Eddie said
to himself.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Willie tried again. This
time he popped the safety release.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Cable . . .&quot; Eddie
mumbled.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bar lifted and the crowd went &quot;Ahhhhh.&quot; The riders were quickly pulled to the platform.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The cable is <i>unraveling</i> . .
. .&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And Eddie was right. Inside
the base of Freddy's Free Fall, hidden from view, the cable that lifted Cart
No. 2 had, for the last few months, been scraping across a locked pulley.
Because it was locked, the pulley had gradually ripped the cable's steel wires
-- as if husking an ear of corn -- until they were nearly severed. No one
noticed. How could they notice? Only someone who had crawled inside the
mechanism would have seen the unlikely cause of the problem.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The pulley was wedged by a
small object that must have fallen through the opening at a most precise moment.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A car key.</font></p>
<p class="spbk"><span class="spbkcaps"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;D</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana">on't
release the CART!&quot; Eddie yelled. He waved his arms. &quot;HEY! HEEEEY! IT'S THE
CABLE! DON'T RELEASE THE CART! IT'LL SNAP!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The crowd drowned him out.
It cheered wildly as Willie and Dominguez unloaded the final rider. All four
were safe. They hugged atop the platform.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;DOM! WILLIE!&quot; Eddie
yelled. Someone banged against his waist, knocking his walkie-talkie to the
ground. Eddie bent to get it. Willie went to the controls. He put his finger on
the green button. Eddie looked up.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NO, NO, NO, DON'T!&quot;</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eddie turned to the crowd.
&quot;GET BACK!&quot;</font></p>
            </font></font>
            <font face="Verdana" size="4">
<p class="txt"></font>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Something in Eddie's
voice must have caught the people's attention; they stopped cheering and began
to scatter. An opening cleared around the bottom of Freddy's Free Fall.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And Eddie saw the last face
of his life.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was sprawled upon the
ride's metal base, as if someone had knocked her into it, her nose running,
tears filling her eyes, the little girl with the pipe-cleaner animal. Amy?
Annie?</font></p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="4">
<p class="txt"></font>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Ma . . . Mom . . . Mom .
. . &quot; she heaved, almost rhythmically, her body frozen in the paralysis of
crying children.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Ma . . . Mom . . . Ma . . . Mom .
. . &quot;</font></p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="4">
<p class="txt"></font>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Eddie's eyes shot from
her to the carts. Did he have time? Her to the carts --</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"></p>
<p class="txt"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whump</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.
Too late. The carts were dropping -- <i>Jesus, he released the brake!</i> -- and
for Eddie, everything slipped into watery motion. He dropped his cane and pushed
off his bad leg and felt a shot of pain that almost knocked him down. A big
step. Another step. Inside the shaft of Freddy's Free Fall, the cable snapped
its final thread and ripped across the hydraulic line. Cart No. 2 was in a dead
drop now, nothing to stop it, a boulder off a cliff.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In those final moments,
Eddie seemed to hear the whole world: distant screaming, waves, music, a rush of
wind, a low, loud, ugly sound that he realized was his own voice blasting
through his chest. The little girl raised her arms. Eddie lunged. His bad leg
buckled. He half flew, half stumbled toward her, landing on the metal platform,
which ripped through his shirt and split open his skin, just beneath the patch
that read <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Eddie</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Maintenance</span>.
He felt two hands in his own, two small hands.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A stunning impact.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A blinding flash of light.</font></p>
<p class="txt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">And then, nothing.</font></font></FONT></p>
