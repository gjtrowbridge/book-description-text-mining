<div align="center"><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trouble</strong></p></div>

<p>Spring had come to the Barony of Cant. New grass waved
beyond the sheepfolds, and the flocks fairly ran to the shears, eager to be
free of their wooly winter coats. The streams sang of melting snow, and high
clouds grazed the pastures of the sky. Only an eagle troubled the springtime
ease of pasture, brook, and sky. It rode the warm air seeking prey, and when
its wings crossed the sun they cast a menacing shadow on the land.</p>

<p>Lucy Wickwright saw the bird, but she had other troubles to
contend with this morning. She pushed her glasses up her nose and looked down
from her high perch on a tower of Castle Cant.</p>

<p>"The grown-ups aren't going to like this," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Wickwright," said Pauline, "would you quit gawking and make
yourself useful?"</p>

<p>Lucy turned around. The Adored &amp; Honorable Pauline
Esmeralda Simone-Thierry von Cant was bent over the catapult, a strand of hair
dangling in her face. She and Lucy had wheeled the weapon around so that it
faced the courtyard, and now Pauline struggled at the winch, her tongue
sticking out as she slowly cranked down the throwing arm.</p>

<p>"Mistress," Lucy said, stepping away from the parapet, "I
don't think&#151;respectfully&#151;that this is such a very good idea."</p>

<p>Lucy was Pauline's maidservant and had to address her as "mistress,"
even though she was a year older and nearly a thumb taller than the Baron's
daughter. Except for her weekly half-holiday, on Saturday afternoons, Lucy
spent the better part of every day caring for Pauline. She dressed her mistress
in the morning, served her at table, and tidied her chambers at night. She was
also encouraged (in the words of the <em>Constitution for the Benevolent Employment
of Men-at-Arms, Artisans, Husbandmen, &amp; Domestic Servants</em>) "to satisfy all
the Whims &amp; Requests of the Noble Person, excepting such as may give rise
to Treasons, Gross Offenses, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Pauline, unfortunately, was terribly prone to Whims.</p>

<p>"The trigger!" she said. "Hurry! My arms are breaking!"</p>

<p>Lucy knelt beside the creaking engine of war and guided the
iron catch of the trigger into a ring on the throwing arm. Pauline let go the
winch, and the heavy beam caught the trigger with a terrible <em>clank</em>! Lucy
stepped away as the machine popped and groaned in frustration, like an old man
trying to get up from his chair. Pauline brushed her hands on her snowy
pinafore.</p>

<p>"So," she said with a satisfied smile, "what do you think
now?"</p>

<p>Lucy glanced nervously toward the parapet.</p>

<p>"Maybe we could wait till later," she suggested.</p>

<p>"But then no one would <em>see</em>," Pauline said. "Come, help me to
load it."</p>

<p>The ammunition steamed in a wicker basket at their feet. The
girls had crept into the baronial laundry and collected the wet heap of
underclothes while Mr. Fuller and his assistants sipped their morning tea.
There were long bloomers with frilly gathers, balloonish drawers embroidered
with the baronial crest, sleek slips, plain vests, and complex corsets with
snapping straps. They had stopped to rest three times as they hauled the basket
up the winding steps of the tower.</p>

<p>"This is a madcap caper, Wickwright!" Pauline said, grasping
a handle of the basket. "I'm such an imp! This will go down in <em>history</em>! On
three, then. One! . . ."</p>

<p>Lucy bent over the basket.</p>

<p>"Please to lift with your knees, mistress," she advised.</p>

<p>"Two! . . ."</p>

<p>Lucy gripped the handle.</p>

<p>"Two and a half! . . ."</p>

<p>Lucy held her breath. One never knew how many fractions
Pauline might count.</p>

<p>"Two and three quarters! . . . <em>Three</em>!"</p>

<p>They upended the soggy contents of the basket into the rope
net at the end of the throwing arm. As the mass of underwear slowly
settled&#151;like an undercooked pudding turned out of its mold&#151;Lucy again glanced
over the parapet. Lord Cant had emerged from the castle and now lumbered across
the rocky courtyard called the bailey, his progress attended by guards in
crimson frocks and flat bronze helmets. Behind him came a crowd of ministers
and nobles who gossiped and traded tablets of chewing gum, their elegant robes
sweeping the stones. At the rear straggled a whiskered, unhappy-looking man in
a chef 's white blouse and hat, who held in his fist the two feet of a
clacking, even unhappier-looking hen.</p>

<p>The party reached the prisoner, a well-knit young man who
knelt with bowed head on the flints of the courtyard, naked except for a dirty
pair of breeches. He had been there since sunrise, guarded by the black-hooded
executioner, who stood at attention with his axe. Lucy found her eyes drawn to
this prisoner, though she could not say why. Now the bailiff strode from the
crowd of spectators and unrolled a parchment. His voice echoed up the castle
walls.</p>

<p>"The prisoner . . . <em>ner, ner</em> . . . having been found guilty
. . . <em>ty, ty</em> . . . of the grave and infamous offense . . . <em>fense, fense</em> . . .
of slandering the noble pastime of chewing gum . . . <em>um, um</em> . . . awaits the
Just and Benevolent Execution . . . <em>shun, shun</em> . . . of the sentence . . .

<em>tence, tence</em> . . . of Death! . . . <em>death! death!</em>"</p>

<p>"Papa's cap is on crooked," Pauline said, peeking over
Lucy's shoulder. "I daresay he's just got out of bed."</p>

<p>Lucy imagined she was right. Adolphus, Lord Cant, the
Exalted &amp; Merciful Protector of the Barony, blinked sleepily in the morning
light. His unwashed hair curled in wayward tendrils from beneath his baronial
cap, and he scratched his belly as an underling approached to offer him a paper
on a silver platter. He lifted it in a trembling hand.</p>

<p>"Stay thy hand, executioner!" he said, squinting at the
script. His voice was low and wheezy&#151;Lucy could barely hear it from the tower.
He coughed feebly, then went on. "We are touched by pity. Our tender heart . .
."</p>

<p>"Too tender!" chanted the ministers and nobles, their words
slightly garbled by chewing gum. Lucy heard a bubble pop.</p>

<p>". . . Our tender heart," the Baron went on, "and the
precepts of the Wise Teachers, move us to pity. We command that this sentence
be lifted, and that the prisoner, for the example of the people and the good of
his mortal spirit, be mercifully sentenced to a term of six months at hard
labor."</p>

<p>"Hail the Compassionate Protector!" chanted the crowd.</p>

<p>"Poor chicken," Lucy sighed.</p>

<p>"Yet . . . <em>et, et</em> . . . the ransom of blood . . . <em>udd, udd</em> .
. . must be paid! . . . <em>aid! aid!</em>" bellowed the bailiff. "Who brings an
offering? . . . <em>ing? ing?</em> What blood shall answer . . . <em>ser, ser</em> . . . for this
crime . . . <em>ime . . . ime?</em>"</p>

<p>The cook stepped forward and lifted the hen overhead. The
startled fowl, having hung upside down all the while, flapped its wings dizzily
as it struggled to stay balanced in the cook's upraised fist. Feathers fell as
the bird was carried to the Stone of Justice, where the executioner waited, his
axe resting on a hairy shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the spectators.</p>

<p>"Now!" Pauline squealed, pulling Lucy away from the parapet.
She pressed the lanyard of the trigger into her maidservant's hand. "I'll count
down from three!"</p>

<p>"But don't you want to do it?" Lucy asked. Her nose began to
drip, as it often did when trouble loomed. She sniffed, hoping her mistress
wouldn't notice.</p>

<p>"I'm the mastermind of this caper," said Pauline. "You're
the henchman. Masterminds give orders; henchmen obey."</p>

<p>"Yes, mistress."</p>

<p>Lucy heard the chicken flapping and cawing&#151;the cook had laid
it on the Stone of Justice. Pauline hurried back to the parapet and leaned out.</p>

<p>"Three! . . . ," she cried. "Two! . . . Just think,
Wickwright, you may save a chicken's life. . . . One! . . . Nine-sixteenths! .
. . Five-thirteenths! . . . One-twelfth! . . . <em>Pull!</em>"</p>

<p>Lucy gave the lanyard a mighty tug. But the catapults of
Castle Cant were never meant for heaving soggy underwear over the heads of
ministers and nobles, and when the great beam swung Lucy found that wet
knickers, slips, drawers, and corsets made the worst missiles imaginable. They
tangled in the rope netting of the ammunition basket and the catapult slammed
the dripping mass of laundry against the parapet with a great, horrible <em>squish!</em></p>

<p>Had Pauline stood a foot to her left she would have been
driven like a peg through the slate roof of the tower. She escaped with a
drenching of gray, sudsy water, but only a solitary pair of bloomers was hurled
into the sky. Lucy, who had fallen on her backside after pulling the trigger,
scrambled to her feet as the catapult's arm swung back, its load of drawstring
shorts and lisle stockings peeling free and plopping sadly on the slates around
her. Pauline stumbled away from the parapet, wiping dirty bubbles from her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You <em>soaked</em> me!" she wailed.</p>

<p>Lucy peeked over the wall. The crowd in the bailey gazed up,
their attention commanded by the sound of crashing laundry. The hen had got
loose and ran from the pursuing cook. The bloomers unfurled and spiraled down
like a maple seed, veering this way and that before landing with a quiet slurp
on the prisoner's upturned face.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Lucy whispered.</p>

<p>"Seize her! . . . <em>her! . . . her!</em>" shouted the bailiff.</p>

<p>"Run!" said Pauline.</p>

<p>"Yike!" said Lucy.</p>

<p>She dashed down the parapet walk. Shouted orders echoed from
the courtyard, and guardsmen raced to the towers. Lucy hoped her mistress could
delay them, for it was a long way to the castle keep, where she might run down
the corner tower and disappear in the labyrinth of the north wing. Looking over
the parapet, she saw that the guards below were outpacing her.</p>

<p>She ran on, her shoes pounding the slates of the parapet
walk, and when she reached the corner tower she stopped, her lungs on fire. To
her horror she heard the <em>patter-flop</em> of guardsmen's sandals, already well up
the spiral stairs. She started back through the arch to the parapet walk, but
by now two guardsmen had arrived at the linen-shrouded catapult. One of them
offered Pauline a consoling handkerchief.</p>

<p>"There she is!" the other cried.</p>

<p>Lucy flew down the stairs, toward the climbing sandals of
her pursuers. They surely thought she had gone mad, running down toward them,
and they gave a shout each time a circuit of the stairs brought her into view.
For once Lucy was grateful for her outlandish, rubber-soled shoes. They were
the only sneakers ever known in the castle, where clothing styles of one
hundred and fifty years ago&#151;such as Pauline's pinafore&#151;were considered daringly
modern. Down she ran, her feet barely touching the steps, until another turn on
the winding stairs would have put her in the guards' clutches.</p>

<p>With a determined<em> hyuh!</em> she swung down a dim passage and
sprinted to another flight of steps, steep and narrow and less footworn than
those of the tower. She scrambled up, on aching legs, to a landing where an oil
lamp burned in a bracket on the wall. There she stopped, wheezing hard, her
sandal-shod pursuers following noisily up the narrow steps. She turned the
lamp's screw until the flame was drowned in oil, then ran blindly on through
the darkness. When it seemed her legs could carry her no farther she gained a
second landing. A yellow candle burned there, by an oaken door on which a sign
warned&#151;</p>

<div align="center"><p><strong>Quiet!</strong></p></div>

<p>Lucy blew out the candle, opened the door, and entered the
familiar, cavernous hall of the Baronial Library. Dusty light fell from the
high windows to the floor where, like ancient, molting buzzards in their nests,
threadbare scholars sat at tables piled with books. Lucy forced herself to walk
calmly, her hands in her pockets. Dr. Azziz, the librarian, glanced up from her
tall wheeled chair as Lucy strolled by.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Lucy!" she whispered. "What brings you &#151;"</p>

<p>Her greeting was cut off by a tumult beyond the door&#151;the
clang and clatter of guardsmen's helmets striking granite. They had arrived at
the darkened first landing, and had tried to put their feet on a step that was
not there. Strong oaths barked up the stairs.</p>

<p>"My word!" said the librarian. "What's happening out there?"</p>

<p>"I passed some guardsmen drinking beer, ma'am," Lucy said.</p>

<p>"Outrageous!" said Dr. Azziz. "There are <em>scholars</em> working
here!" She beckoned her assistant, who was waving a feather duster at a nearby
inkstand. "Carlos, take me to the door!"</p>

<p>Lucy walked away as quickly as decorum allowed. She was a
scrupulous girl, careful never to lie, and it was true that she had passed
drunken guardsmen&#151;many times, in fact. She saw no reason to tell the librarian
exactly <em>when</em> that had happened, for it would be a long story, and she considered
herself to be in a hurry. Already the cursing guardsmen were racing up the last
flight of stairs.</p>

<p>At the high canyons of the bookshelves she glanced back to
make sure the librarian was not looking, then sprinted silently to the other
end of the library. She slipped through the door just as the guards thudded
against the one behind her. Kneeling, she took a barrette from her hair and
wedged it under the door, kicking it tight with the toe of her sneaker.</p>

<p>A long, windowless corridor stretched before her, hung at
great intervals with lamps that seemed to shiver in their thin blankets of
light. Lucy groaned. Dr. Azziz might delay the guards for a moment, but they
would surely catch her before she made it halfway down the corridor. She ran to
the first of the iron-hinged doors&#151;of course it was locked&#151;and heard Dr. Azziz
crying in protest as the guardsmen stomped noisily across her library. Lucy ran
from door to door, testing each stubbornly bolted latch. Her nose dripped
horribly. The guardsmen had begun to throw themselves against the jammed door
when, at last, a latch gave way to her hand. Despite her urgent terror she
stopped to read the plaque on the door, for Lucy was a well-brought-up girl and
would never dream of barging in on an utter stranger. She squinted to make out
the words in the dim light.</p>

<div align="center"><p>Baronial Commission on Lexicography,<br>

Orthography, &amp; Grammar<br>
DR. COSTIVE GUTZ<br>
Sub-assistant Secretary of Synonyms, Antonyms, &amp; Pleonasms</p></div>

<p>Lucy stepped inside, closing the door quickly but quietly
behind her. The door from the library crashed open and the guards dashed down
the corridor. She bit her tongue until they had passed the office of Synonyms,
Antonyms, &amp; Pleonasms, then fell back against the door and let out her
breath.</p>
