<i>We challenge you to find more
                soul-satisfying chocolates than these, packed inside a red satin
                keepsake box (maybe to hide those first lost teeth, after the
                Tooth Fairy comes?). That's for you alone. Baby will snuggle in
                a white-and-red striped hooded pullover, suitable to the season,
                and each of you will sport a size-appropriate pair of seasonal
                socks, edged with golden arrows for boys, and hearts and beads
                of pink and red (impossible for even the most curious little
                fingers to remove) for girls. Romance missing in your life since
                the advent of you-know-whom? Not after you relax to this CD.
                &quot;Bolero&quot; is only the beginning.</i></span></p>
                <p><span class="f">A familiar place, when you have gained heft
                of life, can feel as confining as a familiar pair of pants when
                you've put on weight. True Dickinson has gained both, and her
                discomfort is as much the pinch of regret as the bitterness she
                feels when she has to suck in her gut to fasten her buttons.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">As the crow flies, which is how people like
                to put it, True Dickinson lives only a mile from Nantucket
                Sound. But recently, and with regret, she has been unable to see
                the pewter of its winter billowing with customary awe, just as
                she has stopped looking at her friends with gratitude, at her
                success with pride, at her small family with surprised
                contentment. Not since she came from her birthplace in Amherst
                to the Cape, first as a sitter during college summer breaks,
                then as a bride with her husband, a pilot for the commuter
                airline, has she felt such unaccustomed restlessness. Stray and
                strange thoughts of moving away sometimes escape her purposeful
                days like loose strands that occasionally escape from her tight
                and sensible French braid, which True is so accustomed to
                plaiting every morning she could do it in the dark. She catches
                herself thinking, I'll blow town, light out for the territories,
                just my son and me, leave the Cape altogether for a someplace
                with more oxygen and more sky.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">Her consternation, of course, is misplaced.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">It is situational, not locational.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">For just as crows don't really fly straight
                -- they are so curious, always swooping off on avian tangents to
                explore something shiny or smelly, that it probably takes a crow
                longer to get anywhere than it takes a human being in a car
                obeying the speed limit -- True feels trapped not by the lack of
                space in the life around her but by the profusion of empty space
                of life within her. She is lonely. The ends of her life are
                working their way loose. Her son, whom she is accustomed to
                thinking of as a little child, is nearly ten, middle-aged, in
                kid years. Thus, True can no longer pretend she is a &quot;young
                widow.&quot; Her mother is growing older; her longtime assistants
                speak of plans to relocate, to take on new adventures.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">She is beginning to see herself as the point
                from which other things depart.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">Would she describe herself in this way?
                Perhaps under hypnosis.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">True knows that she's suffering from seasonal
                lag. And 'tis the season for <i>that</i>. February is no less
                lonely a month in a resort community, where every view is a
                watercolor landscape, than it is anywhere else, and may be more
                so. The closed lids of shops shuttered until summer are
                depressing to those who pass them, even to locals who rave about
                having their streets and churches all to themselves. It's a
                common misconception that people who are inclined to take their
                own lives do so at Christmas. The truth is that fingers itch for
                a strong piece of rope or a stash of sedatives starting in
                February, when the holidays have failed to deliver on their
                promise, and when the unbearable renewal of life brims just
                around the corner.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">It is a particularly bad month for True. The
                month of her birth, it is also the month of her husband's
                long-ago death. Peter Lemieux, who flew eight-seater Cessnas
                through rowdy coastal weather for a living, died ironically,
                struck by a motorist on an icy night very much like this. Pete
                had stopped to help a woman whose car had blown its radiator. A
                moving van had mowed him down. For years, True has been unable
                to remember the sound of Pete's voice, and she has no idea
                whether the image of him she can summon to her mind is a mental
                snapshot of the wedding photo that she dusts along with her lamp
                and her hand lotion, or a true memory of the way he looked.
                True's mother, Kathleen, also widowed young, also by a car
                accident, nods in solemn empathy when True keeps refusing to
                bring out and watch the few videotapes she and Pete made during
                their son Guy's babyhood. Kathleen periodically suggests
                watching the tapes together, as if an erased life were something
                to be reveled in, like a great exfoliating bath. True knows
                that, even after eight years, the sight of Pete's platinum
                crewcut and square-cut face with its pilot's crinkled tan,
                perpetually young, will shatter her complacency, which she
                maintains by carefully separating before from after.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">But more than this, she reckons intuitively
                that what she really cannot bear to see is the infant image of
                Guy, the only child she likely will ever have -- miniature,
                mirthful and trustful, his cheeks drooping, round as peach
                halves, wider than his forehead. That velvety baby touch True
                can remember, and it grieves her to think it will quite probably
                be a touch that, for the rest of her life, she will only borrow.</span></p>
                <p><span class="f">She also knows that, while not quite the
                merry widow, she is not like her mother, not like the other
                young widows at the group she attended briefly, who had vied
                with each other to claim which limbs and digits and months of
                life they would trade for an hour in the arms of their husbands
                ...
