<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#322d5f size=-1><B>January
27/Oval Office/The White House</B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#322d5f
size=-1><BR>"Two months ago, if anybody had said we were gonna catch this in the
first hundred days, I'd have thought they were high."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
fifty-eight-year-old former senator from Colorado and newly elected President of
the United States stared out the much-photographed bay window of the Oval Office
and into the cut-back winter Rose Garden. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What was it
Truman said?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the desktop, the blade end of his letter
opener, engraved with the presidential seal, tapped out a rhythmic figure from
the William Tell Overture known to Americans who came of age in front of three
black-and-white channels of network TV as the theme from <I>The Lone
Ranger</I>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Truman, sir?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a
clubby wing chair, R. Cabot "Bob" Winston, the President's national security
adviser, recognized the galloping little perididdle and made a private note to
include it in his memoirs: One of those little human details people liked to
read about from a historic moment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When they told him
about Fat Boy." The President clanked the blade into a decorated soup can/pencil
holder his youngest daughter once made him for Father's Day. "Damn it, I know
this."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, January of forty-five. In this room." Winston
sat up minutely straighter, unconsciously signaling the sense of occasion he
felt when past presidents were invoked within these walls.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The new President rocked in his leather chair.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With
Harriman and his whole sleek Ivy League crowd telling poor Harry-the-Haberdasher
he had to nuke the Japanese."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or not," Winston said, in a
small bow to the Office.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I think Einstein's group was
the only 'or not.'" The President's dry tone glinted off the darker edge of a
sense of humor familiar to his campaign staff. "Jesus, what the hell did he
say?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston searched his own mental
archives.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A buttoned-down Skull &amp; Bones veteran of
executive-branch politics, he had experienced an extraordinary tenure, having
served at high levels in the NSA and on the National Security Council in both
Bush administrations. His carryover appointment was both an olive branch across
the aisle and a gesture of confidence toward Intelligence: A community
beleaguered by scandal, Cold War excesses, and spectacular failures, now
resurrected and seeking redemption through its mission against global
terrorism.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston, their point man, produced an
answer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Wasn't it, 'How much time do I
have?'"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, 'How much time do I get?'" the President
said, in Harry Truman's flat twang, savoring the Midwest inflection. "How much
time do I get?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston nodded, composed and ramrod
straight.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Younger White House staffers had observed that
he seemed to wear alertness like a mask, as if some hard-bitten mentor from the
halls of spookdom had once cautioned him that blinking one's eyes was a sign of
weakness. And, though word was passed down that the President regarded R. Cabot
Winston as a symbol of national unity, many still referred to him in-house as
"Robo-Bob." It was cruel, but fair.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I guess that's
my question, too, Bob."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're a few days out from final
testing, sir."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Days." The President's surprise was
eloquent enough.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston offered a thin-lipped smile.
"With a caveat which I will explain."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if triggering a
pair of explosive bolts, the national security adviser loudly snapped open the
bombproof briefcase handcuffed to his left wrist. He then produced a file
stamped PROJECT ORION/POTUS/EYES ONLY and laid it flat on the Oval Office desk.
POTUS used reading glasses to inspect it as Winston
explained.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the executive order authorizing
continuing funding of space shield research and testing. The record enclosed
represents decades of development and half a trillion dollars invested, give or
take, each phase of publicly funded R &amp; D supplemented with discretionary
monies by presidential EO. The line for your initials has been
flagged."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noting all the previous presidents' initials
displayed in succession, the new Commander in Chief handled the documents like
rare historical artifacts prepared for display at the Smithsonian. But he'd have
bet his campaign debt that this record would never see the light of
day.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess <I>Star Wars</I> didn't just fade away when
the Wall came down," he said, leafing through the pages.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Fortunately not, sir."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classified above top secret, the
file in the President's hands charted the progress of Project Orion from its
Cold War roots as part of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a.k.a. <I>Star
Wars</I>, to its post-911 incarnation as a space-based laser weapons system
adroitly repositioned as a shield against rogue terrorist
ICBMs.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ups the ante from a few missiles on the ground in
Alaska, doesn't it?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The photon laser leapfrogs all other
missile defense technology, sir."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President nodded,
his apprehensions intact: Space-based weapons more than violated America's
post-ABM strategic defense agreements with Russia. And September 11 no longer
provided a free pass for whatever the U.S. wanted in the name of national
security.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what's the damned caveat, Bob?"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston presented the facts unadorned, like a nice neat
hanging.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's a hard window for deployment, sir. We
have twenty-one days." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's ridiculous. We're still
looking for the johns around here."</FONT>
