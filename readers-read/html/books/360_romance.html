<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly
          before being shot in the back with a tranquilizer dart and dumped half-dazed
          on a stretcher, right before being stolen from the hospital by silent
          men in white coats, Elena Baxter stood at the end of a dying child�s
          bed, her hand on a small bare foot, and attempted to perform a miracle.
          </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> She was
          good at miracles. She had been practicing them for her entire life,
          and at twenty-eight years of age, had become quite proficient at the
          art of doing Strange and Wonderful Things. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The child�s
          name was Olivia McCoy. Eight years old, with a large brain tumor swelling
          against her skull. Conventional treatments had only delayed the inevitable
          and likely worsened the quality of Olivia�s end, and yet, unable to
          let go, Mr. and Mrs. McCoy had brought their daughter to the Milwaukee
          Children�s Hospital for one last stand. The hospital had a good reputation
          for healing childhood cancer, and while the doctors frequently patted
          themselves on the back for their successes, their triumph was tainted
          by uneasiness. They did not know why all the children in their ward
          inevitably recovered. The statistics simply did not allow for such a
          confluence of miracle. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elena,
          a simple unpaid volunteer inside the hospital, was not so surprised.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Today
          she was delivering stool samples and plasma, running from one department
          to the next, taking the calls of the nurses who needed charts delivered,
          patients transferred, messes cleaned. Flowers had to be delivered from
          the gift shop, cards signed by forgetful and not-so-loved-ones. Kind
          words needed to be said to the dying, hands held for just moments, to
          give comfort. The patients, young and old, liked Elena. She made people
          feel good, even if they did not know why. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The nurses
          and doctors knew this, and as Elena had anticipated, allowed her some
          freedom of movement. She could go into patient rooms and sit for a while,
          unattended. The children liked to be read to, especially when their
          parents had to leave for work or run errands or sleep. Olivia, for example,
          enjoyed hearing about the old woman who named things, or the story about
          a kitten with a big meow. Elena thought she was a very sweet girl. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Which
          was why, with the books piled on the bed stand and Olivia fast asleep,
          Elena decided it was time for a little miracle. It was clear to her,
          based on experience, careful eavesdropping, and sneak peaks at Olivia�s
          charts, that the treatments were not working and the girl would be dead
          in a week. With children, unlike adults, Elena could not bring herself
          to perform triage. Every life needed to be saved. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Olivia�s
          foot was cold. Poor wasted body. She slept uncomfortably, with the pale
          exhaustion of the dying: a shallow rest, as though in her mind she knew
          the end was near, and was afraid of never waking up again. Cancer always
          put a bad taste in Elena�s mouth; like an unripe persimmon, shriveling
          the insides of her cheeks. No other disease caused quite the same reaction.
          Elena held on to the little girl�s foot, and through that contact entered
          her dying body. Olivia�s spirit felt older than her years: like a mummy,
          dry and brittle. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elena,
          drifting like a ghost inside Olivia, played her game of possession.
          Breathed for the girl an image of health, coaxing and prodding, a gentle
          <i>heal yourself, bury it down,</i> because Olivia already had everything
          she needed: protective mechanisms that made it possible for any human
          to spontaneously regress even the most malignant of tumors. Natural
          human capabilities were a wondrous thing, but only if the body woke
          long enough to use them. Elena was very good at waking people up. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It took
          some time. Olivia�s body was stubborn. Eventually, though, Elena felt
          the response: a subtle twist, a gathering of strength around the cancer
          in the child�s brain. Little teeth, gnawing away at the tumor. No more
          swelling, after today. The girl would live longer than a week, longer
          than two, and in three, after exceeding everyone�s expectations, after
          the death watch had grown tiresome, the doctors would perform another
          scan and discover the dying tumor, the healing brain, the happy child.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elena
          fled back to her body. Sounds returned: the nurses, chattering softly
          in the hall outside Olivia�s room, the click and beep of essential instruments,
          the squeal of stretcher wheels. She imagined the girl looked better
          already. There was pink in her cheeks. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elena
          never heard the men enter the room. She felt pain between her shoulder
          blades, had a moment to think that was strange because she was always
          careful on the farm and rarely pulled a muscle, and then she started
          falling and it was impossible to stop, to hold on, to keep upright.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hands
          caught her. Rough hands, strong, lifting her off the ground. Her throat
          felt paralyzed. She saw white coats, hard eyes. </font>
        <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Oh,
          no,</i> she thought, lucid enough to feel fear. <i>They finally found
          me.</i> </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elena
          was carried away. </font>
