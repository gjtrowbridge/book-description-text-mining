<p>An unending swarm of giant beetlelike Klikiss poured through the transportal
on Llaro for days, marching from some unknown, distant planet.
During the initial panic, Mayor Ruis and the Roamer spokesman Roberto
Clarin had issued a futile appeal for calm among the people. There was nothing
more they could do. With the Klikiss controlling the transportal, the
colonists had no way to leave Llaro. They were trapped.</p>
<p>The horror and shock gradually dulled to hopelessness and confusion.
At least the creatures hadn't killed anyone. Yet.</p>
<p>Alone on a barren hill, Orli Covitz stood looking toward the termitemound
ruins and the colony settlement. Thousands of intelligent bugs moved
over the landscape, investigating everything with relentless, alien curiosity.
No one understood what the Klikiss wanted&#151;with the exception, perhaps,
of the strangely haunted Margaret Colicos, the long-lost xeno-archaeologist
who had spent years among them.</p>
<p>Presently, the fifteen-year-old girl saw Margaret trudging up the hill toward
her accompanied by DD, the Friendly compy who had taken a liking
to Orli almost as soon as he arrived with Margaret through the transportal.
The older woman wore the field jumpsuit of a xeno-archaeologist, its fabric
and fastenings designed to last for years under tough conditions in the field,
though by now it was tattered and stained.</p>
<p>DD walked cheerfully up to Orli. He studied her expression. "You appear
to be sad, Orli Covitz."</p>

<p>"My planet's being invaded, DD. Just look at them. Thousands and
thousands. We can't live here with them, and we can't get off the planet."</p>
<p>"Margaret Colicos has lived among the Klikiss for a considerable time.
She is still alive and healthy."</p>
<p>Breathing heavily in the dry air, Margaret stopped beside the two. "Physically
healthy, maybe. But you may want to reserve judgment as to my psychological
health."</p>
<p>The distant, shattered gaze of the older woman discomfited Orli. She
didn't want to imagine what Margaret must have endured among the giant
insects.</p>
<p>"I am still getting used to talking with other people again, so my social
skills may be somewhat lacking. I spent so long trying to think like the
Klikiss. It was very draining." She placed her hand on the compy's shoulder.
"I really thought I might go mad . . . until DD arrived."</p>
<p>The compy didn't seem aware of any sort of threat around them. "But
we're back now, Margaret Colicos. And safe among friends."</p>
<p>"Safe?" Orli didn't know if she would ever feel entirely safe again. Not
long after she and her father had left dreary Dremen to become colonists on
Corribus, black robots had wiped out the settlement, leaving only Orli and
Mr. Steinman alive. To make a new start, she had come to Llaro. And now
the Klikiss had invaded.</p>
<p>DD's optimism was unrelenting. "Margaret understands the Klikiss. She
will explain them to the colonists and show you how to live together. Won't
you, Margaret?"</p>
<p>Even the older woman had a skeptical expression on her face. "DD, I
barely understand how I survived. Though my years of training as a xenoarchaeologist
should count for something."</p>

<p>Orli reached out and took her calloused hand. "Then you have to tell
Mayor Ruis and Roberto Clarin what you know."</p>
<p>DD dutifully took her other hand. "Knowledge is helpful, isn't it,
Margaret?"</p>
<p>"Yes, DD. Knowledge is a tool. I'll explain what I learned and hope it
turns out to be useful."</p>
<p>As they descended the hill toward the town, they walked directly past
several spiny Klikiss warriors and a troop of mottled yellow-and-black builders
that had begun to dig long trenches, disregarding any boundaries the
colonists had marked. Anxious, Orli held the woman's hand tightly. Margaret was unruffled, though; she paid no more attention to the individual Klikiss
than the creatures seemed to pay her.</p>
<p>"Why are there so many types of Klikiss? They've all got different colors
and markings." Orli had even seen some with almost human heads and faces
like hard masks, though most just looked like bugs.</p>
<p>"Klikiss don't have sexes, they have sub-breeds. The large spiny ones
are warriors to fight in the many hive wars. Others are gatherers, builders,
scouts, scientists."</p>
<p>"You can't be serious. Those bugs have scientists?"</p>
<p>"And mathematicians and engineers." Margaret raised her eyebrows with
a certain measure of admiration. "They discovered the transportal technology,
after all. They invented the Klikiss Torch and left detailed records and intricate
equations on the walls of their ruins. Those creatures solve problems
through brute force&#151;and they do it well."</p>

<p>Orli watched the swarming Klikiss, whose clustered, towerlike structures
looked like a giant hive complex. "Do they have a queen?"</p>
<p>Margaret stared with unfocused eyes, as if buried in unforgettable nightmares.
"Not a queen&#151;a breedex, neither male nor female. It is the mind and
soul of the hive."</p>
<p>Orli drew the woman's attention back to the real question. "But what
do they want?"</p>
<p>Margaret remained quiet for so long that Orli thought she hadn't heard.
Then the archaeologist said, "Everything."</p>
<p>Most of the Klikiss had moved back into their ancient city as if nothing
had changed in millennia. One huge Klikiss, with a silvery exoskeleton
adorned with black tiger stripes, had an extra pair of segmented legs, a carapace
full of spikes and polished knobs, and several sets of faceted eyes. Its
head/face was ovoid, composed of many small plates that shifted and moved,
almost giving it expressions. This one seemed much . . . vaster somehow,
more important and ominous than the others. Orli stared, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>"That is one of the eight domates that attend the breedex," Margaret
said. "They provide additional genetic material necessary for spreading the
hive."</p>
<p>"Will I see the breedex myself?"</p>
<p>The older woman flinched. "Hope you do not. It is very risky."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see her&#151;it, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Many times. It is how I survived." She offered nothing more.</p>
<p>"So it can't be that risky."</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>They passed by EDF barracks built among the alien towers. The soldiers
were pale and frightened, their uniforms rumpled and stained. These
Eddies&#151;stationed here with instructions to "protect the colonists" and
guard the transportal so the Roamer detainees didn't escape&#151;could now
do little more than watch the invasion, as helpless as the colonists they were
supposed to safeguard.</p>
<p>Orli was surprised to see that the Klikiss had not disarmed the troops.
"Why do the soldiers still have their guns?"</p>
<p>"The Klikiss don't care."</p>

<p>Without asking permission or making any gesture to acknowledge what
they were doing, the Klikiss workers began to tear down the modular barracks,
ripping open the walls with their armored claws.</p>
<p>The edgy EDF soldiers began shouting. "Wait a minute!" Some of them
pushed forward. "At least let us get our stuff out first."</p>
<p>The bustling insects diligently continued their tasks, paying no more attention
to the distraught men than they would to ornamental rocks.</p>
<p>Bolstered by their fellows, several soldiers ran toward the barracks. "Stop!
Hold on!"</p>
<p>Klikiss workers tore one section into scrap metal, strewing dismantled
bunks, storage units, clothing, and supplies around like garbage. The nearest
EDF soldier got in the way of an insectile demolitionist and raised his pulse
jazer rifle. "Back off, bugs! I'm warning you&#151;"</p>
<p>The Klikiss swung a segmented limb, decapitated the man, and returned
to its labors before the corpse fell to the ground. Outraged, nine uniformed soldiers
screamed, took aim with their high-powered rifles, and started shooting.</p>
<p>Margaret groaned and squeezed her eyes shut. "This will turn out
badly."</p>
<p>"Isn't there something you can do?" Orli cried.</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>
<p>As projectiles slammed into them, the insect creatures didn't comprehend
what was happening. Despite the weapons fire cutting them down,
workers continued to destroy lockers full of clothing, equipment, scrapbooks
of friends and family.</p>
<p>EDF weapons splattered eleven of the insect workers before the rest of
the subhive turned on the soldiers. Dozens of spiny warriors marched up
while the soldiers kept firing until their weapons were empty.</p>
<p>Then the Klikiss killed them.</p>
<p>Orli stared at the bloodshed, speechless. Even DD seemed alarmed. A
troop of workers arrived to replace the dead insects, and others hauled the
human and Klikiss bodies away.</p>
<p>A tiger-striped domate strode up to Margaret and spoke in a clattering
language. Margaret made a clicking, unnatural sound in her throat, while DD
translated for Orli. "The domate says those newbreeds are defective. They
have been eliminated from the gene pool." It turned away as a new troop of
workers continued the demolition of the barracks in order to build their own
structures.</p>
<p>"They're going to kill us all, aren't they?" Orli asked with grim
resignation.</p>
<p>"The Klikiss aren't here for you." Margaret narrowed her eyes, staring at
the ancient structure that housed the transportal. "I learned something very
important when I deciphered their language. Their primary enemies are the
black robots. The Klikiss mean to wipe them out. All of the robots. Just don't
get in the way."</p>
