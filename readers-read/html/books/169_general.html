<I>The fire began in the kitchen and spread to the hotel dining room.
Without warning, or perhaps just the one muffled cry of
            alarm,
a ball of fire (yes, actually a ball) rolled through the arched and
shuttered doorway from the kitchen, a sphere of
            moving color so
remarkable, it was as though it had life and menace, when, of course, it
did not &#8212; when, of course, it was
            simply a fact of
science or of nature and not of God. For a moment, I felt paralyzed, and I
remember in the greatest detail
            the way the flame climbed the
long vermilion drapes with a squirrel&#8217;s speed and agility and how the
fire actually leapt from
            valance to valance, disintegrating the
fabric and causing it to fall as pieces of ash onto the diners below. It
was nearly
            impossible to witness such an event and not think a
cataclysm had been visited upon the diners for their sins, past or
future.</I></P>


      <P>If the fact of the fire did not
immediately penetrate my consciousness, the heat of the blast did and soon
propelled me from
         my seat. All around me, there was a confusion of
upended tables, overturned chairs, bodies pitched toward the door of the

dining room, and the sounds of broken glass and crockery. Fortunately, the
windows toward the street, large windows through
         which a body
might pass, had been thrown open by an enterprising diner. I remember that
I rolled sideways through one of these
         window frames and fell onto
the snow and was immediately aware that I should move aside to allow others
to land as I had &#8212;
         and it was in that moment that my
altruism was finally triggered. I rose to my feet and began to assist those
who had sustained
         cuts and bruises and broken bones, or who had
been mildly crushed in the chaos. The blaze lit up the escaped diners with
a
         light greater than any other that could be produced in the
night, so that I was able to see clearly the dazed expressions
         of
those near to me. Many people were coughing, and some were crying, and all
looked as though they had been struck by a blow
         to the head. A few
men attempted heroics and tried to go back into the hotel to save those who
remained behind, and I think
         one student did actually rescue an
elderly woman who had succumbed to paralysis beside the buffet table; but
generally there
         was no thought of reentering the burning building
once one had escaped. Indeed, so great was the heat that we in the crowd

had to move farther and farther across the street until we all stood in the
college quadrangle, surrounded by bare oaks and
         elms and stately
sycamores.
      </P>


      <P>Later we would learn that the
fire had begun with a few drops of oil spilled onto a kitchen fire, and
that the undercook,
         who stood near to the stove, had felt
compelled to extinguish the fire by throwing upon it a pitcher of water and
then, in
         her excitement, fanning the flames with a cloth she was
holding. Some twenty persons in the upper stories of the hotel were

trapped in their rooms and burned to death &#8212; one of these Myles
Chapin from the Chemistry faculty, and what he was doing in
         a
hotel room when his wife and child were safely at home on Wheelock Street I
should not like to speculate (perhaps it was
         his compromised
circumstances that made the man hesitate just a second when he should not
have). Surprisingly, only one of
         the kitchen staff perished, owing
to the fact that the back door had been left open, and the fire, moving
with the particular
         drafts between door and windows, sped toward
the dining room, allowing most of the staff to escape unharmed, including
the
         hapless undercook who had started it all with her fluster.

</P>


      <P>The hotel was situated directly across from
Thrupp College, where I was then engaged as the Cornish Professor of
English Literature
         and Rhetoric. Thrupp was, and is (even now, as
I set down my story), a men&#8217;s school of, shall we say, modest
reputation. Its
         buildings are a motley collection, some of them
truly hideous, erected at the beginning of the last century by men who
envisioned
         a seminary but later contented themselves with a small
enclave of intellectual inquiry and classical education. There was

one impressive Georgian building that housed the administration, but it was
surrounded by altogether too many dark brick structures
         with small
windows and oddly placed turrets that were emblematic of perhaps the most
dismal period of American architecture,
         which is to say early
Victorian Gothic. Some of these edifices surrounded the quadrangle; the
rest spilled along the streets
         of a town that was all but
dominated by the college. Because the school had elected to retain the
flavor of a small New England
         village, however, the colonial
clapboard houses that lined Wheelock Street had been left intact and served
as residences for
         the more eminent figures in the various
faculties. At the outskirts of town, before the granite hills began, lay
the farms:
         struggling enterprises that had been witness to
generations of men trying to eke out a living from the rocky soil, soil
that
         always put me in mind of thin, elderly women.
      </P>



      <P>We ousted, and therefore fortunate, diners stood at the
center of this universe, too stunned yet to begin to shiver in earnest

from the cold and the snow that soaked our boots. Many people were
squinting at the blaze or had thrown their arms over their
         eyes
and were staggering backward from the heat. Somewhat bewildered myself, I
moved aimlessly through the throng, not having
         the wits to walk
across the quadrangle to Woram Hall, where I might have attained my bed.
And so it was that my eyes were
         caught, in the midst of this
chaos, by the sight of a woman who was standing near a lamppost.

</P>


      <P>I have always been a man who, when glancing at
a woman, looks first at the face, and then at the waist (those shallow
curves
         that so signal youth and vitality), and then thirdly at the
hair, assessing in an instant its gloss and length. I know that

there are men for whom the reverse is true and men whose eyes fix
inevitably upon the bodice of a dress and then hope for
         a glimpse
of calf, but on that night, I was incapable of parsing the woman in
question in such a calculated manner simply
         because I was too
riveted by the whole.
      </P>


      <P>I will not say
<I>plain,</I> for who of us is entirely plain in youth? But neither will I
say <I>beautiful,</I> for there was about her face and person a strength of
color and of feature that rendered her neither delicate nor pliant,

attributes I had previously thought necessary for any consideration of true
feminine beauty. She had immoderate height as
         well, which is often
off-putting in a woman. But there was about her a quality of stillness that
was undeniably arresting.
         If I close my eyes now, here in this
racketing compartment, I can travel back in time more than three decades
and see her
         unmoving form amidst the nearly hysterical crowd. And
even the golden brown of her eyes, a color in perfect complement to

the topaz of her dress, an inspired choice of fabric.
      </P>



      <P>(As it happened, this was a skill at which Etna had no peer
&#8212; that of matching her clothing and jewels to her own idiosyncratic

charms.)
      </P>


      <P>The woman had almond-shaped
eyes and an abundance of dark brown lashes. Her nostrils and her cheekbones
were prominent, as
         if there were a foreign element to her blood.
Her acorn-colored hair, I guessed, would unwind to her waist. She was
holding
         a child in her arms, which I took to be her own. My desire
for this unknown woman was so immediate and keen and inappropriate

that it quite startled me; and I have often wondered if that punishing
desire, that sense of fire within the body, that craven
         need to
touch the skin, was not simply the result of the heightened circumstances
of the fire itself. Would I have been so
         ravished had I seen Etna
Bliss across the dining room, or turned and noted her standing behind me on
a street corner? I answer
         myself, as I inevitably do, with the
knowledge that it would not have mattered in what place or on what date I
first saw the
         woman &#8212; my reaction would have been just as
swift and as terrifying.
      </P>


      <P>(In a further
aside, I should just like to add here that I have observed in my sixty-four
years that passion both erodes and
         enhances character in equal
measure, and not slowly but instantly, and in such a manner that what is
left is not in balance
         but is thrown desperately out of kilter in
both directions. The erosion the result of the willingness to do whatever
is necessary
         to obtain the object of one&#8217;s desire, even if
it means engaging in lies or deception or debasing what was once
treasured.
         The enhancement a result of the knowledge that one is
capable of loving greatly, an understanding that leaves one,
paradoxically,
         with a feeling of gratitude and pride in spite of
all the carnage.)
      </P>


      <P>(But, of course, I knew
none of this at the time.)</P>


      <P>When I had attended
with some impatience and distraction to a man who had attached himself to
my arm, an elderly gentleman
         with rheumy eyes looking for his
wife, I turned back to the place where the woman and child had stood and
saw that they were
         gone. With a sense of panic I can only describe
as wholly uncharacteristic and quite possibly deranged &#8212; fortunately
such
         agitation was hardly noticeable in that crowd &#8212; I
searched the quadrangle as a father will for a lost child. Many people
were
         already dispersing to their homes and to cabs (a fact that
did little to ease my anxiety), while others had emerged from the

surrounding houses with blankets and coats and water and cocoa and even
spirits for the victims of the blaze. Some of those
         who had been
in the dining room were now huddled in garments that were either too big or
too small for them; they looked like
         refugees who had beached
themselves upon the quadrangle. By now the fire brigade had arrived and was
turning its hoses on
         the hotel. I am not aware that they saved a
single soul that night, though they did drench the charred building with
water
         that turned to icicles before morning.
      </P>



      <P>I wiped at my cheeks and forehead with my handkerchief.
Strangely, I do not remember feeling cold. I walked amongst the thinning

crowd, my thoughts undisciplined. How was it that this woman had escaped my
notice all the time I had been at Thrupp? After
         all, the village
was not so large as to produce general anonymity. And why had she been
dining at the hotel? Had she been
         sitting behind me as I had eaten
my poached sole in solitude? Had the child been with her then?
      </P>



      <P>I went on in this manner for some time until I began to
slow my pace. It was not that desire had ebbed but rather that fatigue

was overwhelming me. I became aware that I had suffered a terrific shock:
my knees grew shaky, and my hands began to tremble.
         I finally
noticed the cold as well; it cannot have been more than twenty-five degrees
Fahrenheit on that night. I decided
         to seek refuge and was
recrossing the quadrangle for perhaps the fifth time when I heard a
child&#8217;s cry. I turned in the direction
         of the sound and saw
two women standing in the darkness. The taller of the two was half hidden
beneath a rug thrown over her
         shoulders and in which she had
wrapped the child. Next to her, and clinging to her arm, was an older woman
who seemed in some
         distress. She was coughing roughly.
      </P>



      <P>When I drew closer to the threesome, I saw that the
stillness I had observed in the woman with the golden brown eyes had now

been replaced by concern.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I said, approaching swiftly (as swiftly as the fire
itself?), &#8220;are you in need of assistance?&#8221;</P>



<P>Whether Etna Bliss actually saw me then, or not until the following day,
I cannot say, for she was understandably distracted.</P>



<P>&#8220;Please, I must get my aunt home,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;d be grateful if you could find us transportation, for she
has inhaled a great
         deal of smoke and cannot walk the necessary
distance to her house even under the best of circumstances.&#8221;

</P>


      <P>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Will you stay put?&#8221;</P>



<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said simply, thus placing the utmost trust, and
perhaps even the well-being of her aunt, in my person.</P>



<P>I discovered that night that a man is never so capable and alert as when
in the service of a woman he hopes to please. Almost
         at once, I
was in the street with paper dollars in my hand, which caught the eye of a
cabdriver who already had a fare, but
         who doubtless saw an
opportunity to squeeze more bodies onto his frayed upholstered seats. I
completed his calculation by
         leaping onto the carriage and giving
immediate instructions.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Sir, this
is irregular,&#8221; he said, looking for the extra tip.</P>



<P>But I, and rightly so, dressed him down. &#8220;A disaster has occurred
of the most serious proportions, and people all about are
         in dire
need. You should be lending your aid for no pennies at all,&#8221; I said.

</P>


      <P>Astonishingly, for I had in the interim begun
to doubt the reality of my encounter with the arresting woman, the two
women
         with the child were where I had left them. I helped the
older woman, who was by now shivering badly, into the carriage first,

and then gave my hand to the woman with the child &#8212; the hand
surprisingly warm in my frozen one. The other passengers could

barely suppress their annoyance at being delayed to their hot baths, but
they nevertheless moved so that my party could fit.
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;Madam, I shall need an address,&#8221; I said.</P>



      <P>The ride cannot have lasted half an hour, even though the driver
took the other fare home first. I sat across from the aunt,
         who
was still coughing, and from the couple, who might have been thinking of
their lost possessions in the cloakroom (a dyed
         fox coat? an
alligator case?), but I was aware only of a slight pressure against my
elbow, a pressure that increased or decreased
         as the woman beside
me attended to the child or leaned forward to put a hand upon her elderly
aunt&#8217;s arm. And just that slight
         pressure, of which the
woman beside me was doubtless completely unaware, was, I believe, the most
intensely physical moment
         of my life to date &#8212; so much so
that I can re-create its delicate promise and, yes, its eroticism merely by
closing my eyes
         here in my moving compartment, even with all that
came after, all that might reasonably have blotted out such a tender
memory.
      </P>


      <P>We traveled the length of
Wheelock Street until we came to an antique house of beeswax-colored
clapboards. It was an unadorned
         residence, like so many of the
houses of that street. These I much preferred to the frippery that passed
for architecture
         on adjacent Gill Street: large, rambling
structures with gables and porches and seemingly no symmetry, although
these newer
         houses did have better accommodations for indoor
plumbing, for which one might have been willing to trade aesthetics. The

Bliss house had seven bedrooms, not counting attic rooms for servants, and
two parlors, a dining room, and a study. It also
         had, as of a year
previous, steam heat, which hissed and bubbled up in silver radiators. I
sometimes used to think the appliances
         might explode and scald us
to death as we played backgammon or took tea or dined of an evening in
those overly furnished and
         fussily papered rooms.
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;But, madam, I know this house,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;It is the home of William Bliss.&#8221;</P>



<P>&#8220;My uncle.&#8221;</P>


      <P>I then realized that
the woman sitting across from me was not elderly at all, but rather was the
middle-aged wife of the Physics
         Professor, a woman I had met on at
least three occasions at the college.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;Mrs. Bliss,&#8221; I said, addressing her, &#8220;forgive me. I
did not realize . . .&#8221;</P>


      <P>But she, unable to
speak, waved my apology away with a flutter of her hand.</P>



<P>I walked the two women to the front door, which was almost immediately
opened by William Bliss himself.</P>


      <P>&#8220;Van
Tassel, what is this?&#8221; he asked.</P>


      <P>&#8220;A
fire at the hotel,&#8221; I explained quickly. &#8220;We are all lucky to
have escaped with our lives.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Dear
God, he said, embracing his wife and leading her farther into the house.
&#8220;We wondered what all the bells and horns were
         for.&#8221;

</P>


      <P>A housemaid took the child from the woman with
the golden brown eyes, who then turned in my direction, simultaneously
slipping
         the rug from her shoulders and giving it to me to wear.

</P>


      <P>&#8220;Please take this for your journey
home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My aunt and I are very much in your
debt.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Nicholas Van Tassel,&#8221;
I said.</P>


      <P>&#8220;Etna Bliss.&#8221;</P>



      <P>Once again, she put her warm hand in mine. &#8220;How cold you
are!&#8221; she said, looking down and withdrawing her hand almost
immediately.
         &#8220;Will you come in?&#8221;
      </P>



      <P>Though I dearly wanted to enter that house, with its promise of
warmth and its possibility of love (the mind leaps forward
         with
hope in an instant, does it not?), one knew that such was not appropriate
under the circumstances.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Thank you
very much, but no,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You must go inside
now.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Van
Tassel,&#8221; she said. And I think already her mind was on her aunt and
the child and the hot bath that would
         be waiting, for with that,
she closed the door.
      </P>


      <P>Perhaps a brief word
here about my own circumstances at that time, which was December of 1899,
for I believe it is important
         to pass on to subsequent generations
the facts of one&#8217;s heritage, information that is often neglected in
the need to attend
         to the day-to-day and, as a consequence, drifts
off into the ether of time past. My father, Thomas Van Tassel, fought in
the
         War Between the States with the Sixty-fourth Regiment of New
York and sacrificed a leg to that conflict at Antietam, a calamity

that in no way hindered his manhood, as I was but one of eleven children he
subsequently sired off a succession of three wives.
         My mother, his
first wife, perished in childbirth &#8212; my own &#8212; so that I never
knew her, but only the other two. My father,
         clearly a productive
man, was enterprising as well, and built three sizable businesses in his
lifetime: a print shop, to which
         I was apprenticed at a young age;
a carriage shop; and then, as horses quite thoroughly gave way to motors,
an automobile
         showroom. My memories of my father exist primarily
in the print shop, for I hardly knew him otherwise. I often sought refuge

in those rooms of paper and ink and type from my overly populated house in
Tarrytown, New York, with its second and third
         wives: one cold,
the other melancholy, and in neither case well disposed to me, who had
issued from the first wife, the only
         woman my father had ever
loved, a fact he did not shrink from announcing at frequent intervals,
despite the impolitic nature
         of the sentiment and the subsequent
frigidity and sadness that resulted. I was not altogether bereft of
feminine warmth during
         my childhood, however, for I was close to
one sibling, my sister Meritable, the very same sister whose funeral I am
even now
         journeying toward.
      </P>



<P>Perhaps because I was so engaged in the world of ink and broadsides, I
developed an early and passionate appetite for learning
         and was
sent off to Dartmouth College at the age of sixteen. I can still remember
the exquisite joy of discovering that I
         should have a room to
myself, for I had always had to share a room with at least three of my
siblings. The college has an
         estimable reputation and is widely
known, so I shall not linger upon it here, except to say that it was there
that I briefly
         entertained the ministry, later abandoning it for
want of piety.
      </P>


      <P>After obtaining my degree,
by which time I was twenty, I traveled abroad for two years and then was
offered and accepted the
         post of Associate Professor of English
Literature and Rhetoric at Thrupp College, which is located some
thirty-five miles
         southeast of my alma mater. I took this post
with the idea that in a smaller and less well known institution I might
rise
         more quickly and perhaps one day secure for myself the post
of a Senior Professor or even of Dean of the Faculty, positions

that might not have been open to me had I remained at Dartmouth. I had not
thought of taking a post outside of New England,
         though there were
opportunities to do so, the reason being that I had adopted the manners and
customs of a New Englander so
         thoroughly that I no longer
considered myself a New Yorker. Indeed, I had occasionally taken great
pains to present myself
         as a New Englander, once even, I am a bit
chagrined to admit, falsifying my history during my early months at
Dartmouth, a
         pretense that was difficult in the extreme to
maintain and hence was abandoned before I had completed my first year. (It
was
         at Dartmouth that I dropped the second <I>a</I> from
Nicholaas.)
      </P>


      <P>Because my father was, by the
time I had returned from Europe, modestly well off, I could easily have
afforded to have my
         own house in the village of Thrupp. I chose
instead, however, to take rooms in Woram Hall, a Greek Revival structure
affectionately
         known as Worms, for the reason that I did not
particularly wish to live entirely alone. I had as well a somewhat
misguided
         idea that boarding nearer to the students would allow me
to come to know them intimately, and that this would, in turn, make

me a better teacher. In fact, I rather think the reverse was true: more
often than not, I discovered, close proximity gave
         birth to a
thinly veiled antagonism that sometimes baffled me. My rooms consisted of a
library, a bedroom, and a sitting room
         in which to receive guests
and preside over tutorials. In adopting New England ways, born two
centuries earlier in Calvinistic
         discipline, I had furnished these
rooms with sturdy yet unadorned pieces &#8212; five ladder-back chairs, a
four-poster bed, a dresser,
         a cedar chest, a tall stool, and a
writing desk in which I kept my papers &#8212; eschewing the more ornate
and oversized furnishings
         of the era that were so fashionable and
so much in abundance elsewhere. (I think now of Moxon&#8217;s rooms: one
could hardly move
         for the settees and hassocks and English desks
and velvet drapes and ornate marble clocks and fire screens and mahogany
side
         tables.) And as form may dictate content, I fit my daily
habits to suit my austere surroundings, rising early, taking exercise,

arriving promptly to class, disciplining when necessary with a firm hand,
and requiring much of my students in the way of
         intellectual
progress. Though I should not like to think I was regarded as severe by my
students and colleagues, I am quite
         certain I was considered
stern. I think now, with the forgiveness that comes with reflection in
later years, that I often
         tried too hard to show myself the
spiritual if not the physical progeny of my adopted forebears, even though
what I imagined
         to be the license of my New York heritage, as
evidenced in my father&#8217;s excessive procreativity, would occasionally
cause me
         to stray from this narrow and spartan path, albeit seldom
in public and never at Thrupp. For my parenthetical pleasure, I

traveled down to Springfield, Massachusetts, as did many of my unmarried,
and not a few married, colleagues. I remember well
         those furtive
weekends, boarding the train at White River Junction and hoping one would
not encounter a colleague in the dining
         car, either coming or
going, but always ready with a fabricated excuse should an encounter
present itself. Over time, as a
         result of such encounters, perhaps
five or seven or ten, I had to develop a &#8220;sister&#8221; in
Springfield whom I had twice monthly
         to visit, even though said
&#8220;sister&#8221; actually resided in Virginia, prior to moving to
Florida, and wrote to me upon occasion,
         the envelopes with the
return address a source of some anxiety to me. I shall not here set forth
in detail my activities while
         in Springfield, though I can say
that even in that city I proved to be, during my visits to its less savory
neighborhoods,
         as much a man of loyalty and habit as within the
brick and granite halls of Thrupp.
      </P>


      <P>More
dazed than sensible, I took the cab back to the hotel, which was by now
beginning to form its fantastical icicles as
         a result of the
sprays of water from the fire hoses. I lingered only briefly, however, due
to the combination of penetrating
         cold and shock, which had begun
to make me shiver in earnest. I went back to my rooms at Worms, where I
directed the head
         boy to make a good fire and to draw a hot bath.

</P>


      <P>Worms did not then, nor does it now, have
private bathrooms within its suites, and so I locked the door to the common
bath
         as I customarily did. The steam had made a cloud upon the
cheval mirror, and I wiped away a circle of condensation so that
         I
could just make out my bewildered face. There was a bloody scratch on my
cheek I had not known about. I was not accustomed
         to spending any
time in front of the glass, for I did not like to think myself vain, even
in private, but that night I tried
         to imagine how I, as a man,
might appear to a woman who had just met me. At that time &#8212; I was
thirty &#8212; I had a considerable
         thicket of light brown hair,
undistinguished in its color (this will surprise my son, for he has known
me for a decade now
         as only bald), and what is commonly called a
barrel chest. That is, I had strength in my body, a body quite out of
keeping
         with my sedentary and intellectual occupations, a strength
I could not refine but instead had learned to live with. I do not

know that I had ever been called handsome, my excursions to Springfield
notwithstanding, for my lips were thickish in the
         way of my Dutch
forebears, and the bone structure of my face was all but lost within the
stolid flesh bequeathed to me by
         generations of burghers. To
dispel that somewhat unpleasant image, and to appear more academic, I had
cultivated spectacles
         I did not actually need.
      </P>



      <P>After my inspection, which taught me nothing I did not already
know, except perhaps that one cannot hide one&#8217;s naked emotions

as well as one might wish, I lowered myself into water so hot that my
submerged skin immediately turned bright pink, as though
         I had
been scalded. The boy, who I knew was angling for an A in &#8220;Logic and
Rhetoric,&#8221; had set out a cup of hot cocoa, and
         I indulged in
these innocent pleasures, all the while seeing in my mind&#8217;s eye the
form and face of Etna Bliss and feeling
         anew the exquisite
pressure of her arm against my own. Happily, the bath, as a hot soak will
often do, produced a drowsiness
         sufficient to send me off to my
bed.
      </P>


      <P>In the morning, I woke in a state of
agitation and was forced to complete my toilet in haste and miss breakfast
altogether
         in order not to be late for my first class of the day,
&#8220;The Romantic Lyric Poets&#8221; (Landon and Moore and Clare and so
forth).
         When I arrived at the classroom, I saw that the fire in
the stove had gone out for want of tending and that the students sat

with their coats still on, their mufflers wrapped round their necks. Though
cold, my classroom was not an unpleasant one.
         The wainscoting had
recently been painted white, an inspired touch that lent an illusion of
light and air previously denied
         by the dark walnut paneling so
ubiquitous in those rooms. Above the wainscoting were large windows that
looked out over the
         quadrangle&#8217;s elms and sycamores. As one
could take in this view only while standing, I often laid my arm upon the
deep sills
         and gazed out as the students wrote their exercises and
examinations. That day, of course, the view was severely compromised

by the black maw of the hotel and the soot-dirty snow; in any event, I was
too distraught to appreciate a view of any kind
         &#8212; beautiful
or not.
      </P>


      <P>It was immediately obvious that
the students&#8217; attentions were not on their lessons either. The talk
was all of the fire, during
         which I attained some slight celebrity
as a result of having actually been present in that ill-fated dining room;
and like
         all good tellers of tales, I perhaps embellished some
incidents and details to improve the narrative. I described the ball

of fire and the melee that followed.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;Many persons were in need of assistance,&#8221; I said, adopting
an uncharacteristically casual pose by sitting on the edge of
         my
desk. I removed a piece of lint from my trousers.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;And what were the injuries, sir?&#8221;</P>



<P>This from Edward Ferald, a slack-jawed boy with narrow eyes, who was
always currying favor, but behind my back, I knew, referred
         to me,
as did some of the other students, as &#8220;Scrofulous,&#8221; which is
taken, of course, from the Latin, <I>sus scrofa,</I> for pig. Well, not pig
exactly, but boar. Wild boar, to be precise. Why, I do not know, since I
don&#8217;t think I resembled a
         boar, but no matter. Almost all
the faculty had unflattering nicknames then: John Runciel was
&#8220;Rancid&#8221;; Benjamin Little, as
         I recall, was
&#8220;Little Man&#8221;; Jonathan Whitley was &#8220;Witless.&#8221;
(Surely &#8220;Rancid&#8221; is worse than &#8220;Scrofulous&#8221;?)
Ferald&#8217;s pleasure
         came not from learning but from provoking
an unattractive earnestness in his tutors that he blandly pretended not to
understand.
         Thus a tutorial with Ferald could prove to be a
wretched exercise. On the few occasionsI had tried to resort to cunning to

outwit him, I had failed dismally, verbal agility not being my strong
suit.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Many cuts and bruises and
broken bones,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And smoke inhalation. Twenty
perished.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;And yourself,
sir?&#8221; Ferald asked unctuously. &#8220;I hope you yourself were not
harmed.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;No damage to myself, I am
happy to report.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Happy
indeed,&#8221; said Ferald, blinking lazily.</P>



<P>&#8220;Twenty burned to death, sir?&#8221; asked Nathan Foote, a
fair-haired young man who wore on his face an expression of genuine
horror,
         though this cannot have been news. The college had been
abuzz with the statistic since the night before.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;One hopes . . .&#8221; I began. But in that instant, time slowed
and came altogether to a stop, and I saw, through the window,
         a
woman with a child, a vision so vivid and visceral that I feared I was
hallucinating. I put my hand to my forehead, which
         was clammy
despite the frigid air of the classroom.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; asked Foote, alarmed not only by my truncated
sentence, but by my appearance.</P>


      <P>I forced my eyes
to focus on his face.</P>


      <P>&#8220;One hopes the
unfortunate victims perished as a result of smoke inhalation and not of the
flames themselves,&#8221; I said, struggling
         to regain my
composure.
      </P>


      <P>There was a long moment of
silence in the classroom.</P>


      <P>&#8220;I have suddenly
realized,&#8221; I said quickly, &#8220;that it is inappropriate to be
having class on a day when we should, in fact,
         be honoring those
wretched persons who perished &#8212; and, indeed, for whom our college
flag is this morning at half-mast. And
         so I have determined that
we shall have no more lessons now. You are dismissed to your rooms and to
the chapel for contemplation
         upon the brevity of life, the
capricious hand of fate, and the necessity to remain continually in a state
of grace.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>Some of the more alert
students, Ferald for one, were on their feet at once, sensing the
unexpected opportunity for an hour
         of leisure, while the others
sat stunned for a moment before gathering notebooks and texts. How soon the
classroom emptied
         I do not know, for by then I was briskly on my
way to Wheelock Street.
      </P>


      <P>(I did sometimes
wonder if my Latin nickname wasn&#8217;t, after all, a mistranslation, or
an attempt at homonymic wit. Had the
         student who had invented the
name meant <I>bore?</I> Wild bore?)
      </P>


      <P>The
ice ruin of the hotel was now beginning to melt in the bright sun of
mid-morning, and as I passed that godforsaken structure,
         the
continuous sound of dripping from a thousand icicles, a rain that glistened
and sparkled as it fell, tinkled like fine
         crystals. I saw two
young boys, clearly truant from the local grammar school, poking at the
rubble, possibly for valuables
         that had survived the fire. I
barked at them to leave the area at once, as any fool could see that the
entire edifice was
         in danger of toppling (and would, in fact,
collapse three weeks later during a particularly wet and heavy snowfall).

</P>


      <P>The sense of urgency within me to see the woman
who had captured my thoughts was such that I had to force myself to walk
at
         a normal gait so as not to attract undue attention. I wanted to
reach the beeswax-colored colonial as soon as possible, for
         I had
an apprehension (as it happened, unwarranted) that Etna Bliss had already
left the residence to return to wherever she
         had come from. I
didn&#8217;t think she lived with Professor Bliss. If she did, I reasoned,
I surely would have heard of this person
         in their household, or,
more likely, have encountered her at a college function. Thrupp had
approximately fifty faculty, most
         of whom lived as if in glass
boxes, subject to the keenest scrutiny on the part of students and fellow
faculty alike; so much
         so that it often seemed as though one knew
everything there was to know about another in that college and in that
village,
         when, of course, one did not, secrets being the most
zealously guarded of possessions.
      </P>


      <P>My gait
slowed somewhat as I approached the Bliss residence, naked in December
without its canopy of elms. Such a spontaneous
         decision as I had
made to visit this house was quite out of keeping with my habits, and I
felt, as a result, uncomfortably
         rattled and incautious. But with
a momentum for which I could not easily account, I was propelled to William
Bliss&#8217;s front
         door. Thus I lifted the door knocker and
tipped the hand of fate.
      </P>


      <P>It was some
moments before my summons was acknowledged, and when the door was opened,
it was by Etna Bliss herself.</P>


      <P>Had I had any
doubts, in the intervening hours since I had last seen her, about the
reality of the thrall in which this woman
         held me, such
uncertainty vanished in her presence. Though she must have moved, to open
the door and so forth, there was again
         such a quality of stillness
that one felt recklessly drawn to her as one who traverses a cliff
occasionally feels perilously
         like throwing oneself over the edge.
She wore a black-and-bronze-striped dress with bronze lace at the collar
and cuffs, a
         dress that was cut in such a way as to present her
bosom as upon a sort of shelf, the effect of which was to make my breath

tight within my own chest. Her face shone in the snow-reflected sunlight,
and one could see that her hair had been freshly
         washed and
refashioned into coiled plaits that one longed (I longed) to unravel. I was
unraveling in her presence.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Miss
Bliss,&#8221; I said, removing my hat.</P>



<P>&#8220;Professor Van Tassel,&#8221; she said, gazing at me and failing
to add the expected pleasantries.</P>


      <P>And I felt
then &#8212; what? &#8212; that already she could see through my fragile
carapace? That she understood all there was to know
         of me? That
she knew why I had come and what I would do even before I did?
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;Forgive the intrusion,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but I
was passing, and I could not help but wonder if your aunt has recovered
from her ordeal.
         I hope I&#8217;m not disturbing you, but I was
thinking this morning about the shock of the event and how it must have
affected
         her.&#8221; I paused. &#8220;And you as well, of
course.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Thank you for
asking,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My aunt has had the doctor,&#8221; she
added, and oddly it was not she who invited me to step
         inside, as
good manners surely required, but rather Bliss himself, who moved into the
vestibule, half spectacles perched at
         the end of his nose, and
said, &#8220;I thought I heard a familiar voice. Van Tassel, come in, come
in, so that I may properly thank
         you for so safely conveying my
wife and granddaughter and niece out of harm&#8217;s way last night. What a
fright my wife has had.
         And you, too, of course.&#8221;

</P>


      <P>&#8220;No fright at all,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;though others certainly did and rightfully so.&#8221;</P>



      <P>I stepped over the threshold.</P>



<P>&#8220;You must stay for a hot drink,&#8221; Bliss said, removing his
glasses and folding the newspaper he held in his hands. &#8220;I should

like an account of the event, if you feel up to it.&#8221;
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I said.</P>



<P>Did Etna Bliss hesitate just the one second before accepting my hat and
gloves? Yes, I am sure she did. I remember distinctly
         the
sensation of holding out my things and for a moment having no taker. What
did she see in me that made her pause? The vast
         hunger that had
shaken me to the bone? And would she have recognized this hunger for having
seen it before on the faces of
         other men, or was she merely
prescient, already intuitive about human want and greed?
      </P>



      <P>(And why, <I>why,</I> I have often asked myself, was it that
woman and not another? Why the curve of that particular cheek and not
another? Why
         the gold of those eyes and not the blue of others? I
have in my lifetime seen a hundred, no a thousand, beautiful women &#8212;

lifting skirts to step over piles of snow, fanning long necks in
restaurants, undressing in the dim electric lights of rented
         rooms
&#8212; but none has ever had upon me the effect that Etna Bliss had: a
sensation quite beyond that which can be explained
         by science.)

</P>


      <P>She took my coat then and hung it on a hat rack
in the corner. She turned slightly toward me.</P>



<P>&#8220;Etna, I wonder if you would . . .&#8221; William Bliss began, not
unkindly but perhaps suggesting the nature of Etna&#8217;s place within

the household. There was no further need to elaborate, for already she had
turned toward the kitchen to tell the cook that
         tea was needed.

</P>


      <P>What relief it was for me to see her retreating
form! The respite allowed me some moments to collect my wits and speak to

Bliss in the manner to which we were accustomed, the manner of men who do
not know each other well but are regarded as colleagues
         and thus
have immediately a common vocabulary that must be respected before any
dislike or love can form.
      </P>


      <P>I did not often
encounter William Bliss at school, since he was married and therefore did
not reside in college rooms; nor
         did we ever have occasion to work
together, coming as we did from separate disciplines. Also, Bliss was older
than I by a
         good twenty years, and thus I regarded him as from a
different generation. He directed me to the front parlor.
      </P>



      <P>I cannot exaggerate the feeling of claustrophobia that
room produced, the claustrophobia of months spent indoors, of oxygen

seemingly sucked from the air by the plethora of ornate pieces and dozens
of objets, each demanding the eye&#8217;s attention, so
         that one
felt not only breathless and oppressed, but also as though a migraine were
imminent. It was a room that with its
         rosewood spool turnings and
carved oak trefoils, its gilded mirrors and marble-topped tables, its
serpentine tendrils of overgrown
         plants and cast-iron lanterns,
its stenciled stripes and floral motifs, its flocked wallpaper and glass
curtains, its oriental
         rugs and Chinese vases and fringed
tablecloths and its iron clock &#8212; not to mention the dozens of
daguerreotypes in silver
         and wood and marquetry frames that seemed
to cover every available surface &#8212; leached the vitality from the
body. (A man&#8217;s
         body, at least, for one deduced immediately
that the room reflected a woman&#8217;s taste; even Moxon&#8217;s rooms, at
their very worst,
         might have been considered spare by comparison.)
Because of all the plants in the windows, only the dimmest light entered

the room, and how Bliss had been able to read a newspaper there, I do not
know, though perhaps he had been reading in his
         study. It was
evidence at the very least that William Bliss must have loved his wife very
much to put up with so much excess.

      </P>



<P>&#8220;Van Tassel, do sit down.&#8221;</P>



<P>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;There might
be good. Oh, let me move that for you.&#8221;</P>



<P>&#8220;No, I can do it.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;You
know, I cannot thank you enough. My wife says you were a hero.&#8221;</P>



      <P>&#8220;Nonsense, it was no more than any man would have
done.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;You are too modest. Is the
college abuzz?&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;I daresay. I have
canceled my classes.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;Have you
indeed? What a splendid idea.&#8221;</P>


      <P>Sometimes
it seems to me that all of life is a struggle to contain the natural
impulses of the body and spirit, and that what
         we call character
represents only the degree to which we are successful in this endeavor. At
that time in my life, when I
         was a younger man, it was often a
desperate struggle &#8212; to take exercise when one did not want to, to
refrain from striking
         a student who much deserved the blow, to put
aside one&#8217;s naked ambition in the service of others, to conquer
rampant desires
         that if left unchecked might manifest themselves
in shocking behaviors &#8212; and as with all struggles, I was occasionally
not
         victorious in these battles. Thus, I fear there were
disturbing ruptures in my composure, as when I lost my temper and berated

a student most harshly, satisfying the anger in myself but leaving the
student trembling; or as when I was unable to refrain
         from
speaking badly of a colleague to gain the favor of another; or as when the
mask of impeccable deportment dropped for
         a moment and revealed
the depth of want beneath, as must have happened, however briefly, in the
silence that followed Etna&#8217;s
         entry into the room in which
her uncle and I were sitting.
      </P>


      <P>Bliss and I
stood politely, and already I was anxious lest the color I could feel
rising at the sides of my neck and into
         my face (a further legacy
of the Dutch blood of my ancestors) betray me. My mouth trembled, a twitch
I sought to hide by pressing
         a knuckle to my upper lip; and thus I
discovered, to my deep chagrin, the blush rising all the while like a flood
tide on
         the night of a full moon, that I had not shaved that
morning and a coarse stubble covered my cheek and jaw.
      </P>



      <P>(I was never well &#8212; though often joyous, never well &#8212;
in Etna&#8217;s presence.)</P>


      <P>She set the tray down
and gestured for us to sit.</P>


      <P>&#8220;Professor Van
Tassel. I hope you did not suffer as a result of your service to our
family,&#8221; she said.</P>


      <P>&#8220;Van Tassel tells
me that twenty perished in the fire,&#8221; Bliss said to his niece.</P>



      <P>Etna accepted this news with remarkable equanimity, unlike
so many of her sex who might have felt it necessary to exclaim
         at
the announcement of ill fortune.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;I
am afraid our fire brigade proved itself most inadequate in the
event,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I am sure there will be an
inquiry.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;I should like to know who
it was who had the foresight to open those windows in the dining
room,&#8221; Etna said, offering me
         a cup of tea. &#8220;I should
like to thank him personally.&#8221;
      </P>



<P>Already I was jealous of this imagined man &#8212; for surely it was a
man, though no one had yet stepped forward &#8212; for being the

recipient of Etna&#8217;s gratitude. &#8220;One so often does not wish to
be singled out for heroics,&#8221; I said inanely.
      </P>



      <P>Etna Bliss had a habit, I would later discover, of smiling
slightly even though her eyes were expressionless, thus giving
         the
impression of inward thinking while not appearing to be impolite. This she
did then; and I will say that when she smiled
         (lips not parted,
only the slightest upward curving of her mouth), her face softened so
thoroughly that she seemed altogether
         the diminutive and pliant
woman one hopes for in a lover, and something else &#8212; even pretty.
Yes, though she was not beautiful,
         she was pretty in those
moments. In later years, it would sometimes be a torment to me to be shut
out from the inner thoughts
         that produced that fleeting smile.

</P>


      <P>My fingers were slipping badly on the cup
handle, causing the china to rattle in its saucer. I was forced to bend to
my tea
         in rather boorish fashion. This disconcerted me so much
that I set the cup down and folded my trembling hands in my lap. I

crossed my legs and noticed that my foot was jiggling.
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;And the little girl?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Has she
recovered from her ordeal?&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;I
rather think that had it not been for the cold, she would have found the
event terribly exciting,&#8221; Etna said. &#8220;This morning,

she could speak of little else.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>I
watched Etna bring her own cup to her lips and noted that there was no
trembling in those long fingers.</P>


      <P>&#8220;Van
Tassel teaches English Literature and Rhetoric at the college,&#8221; Bliss
said.</P>


      <P>&#8220;An acceptable passion,&#8221; I
added, smiling in her direction. She did not smile back, but neither did
she look away, and I fancy
         she studied me for a moment then.
&#8220;And are you in Thrupp for an extended visit?&#8221; I asked, unable
to stifle my curiosity any
         longer.
      </P>



<P>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You do not like your
tea?&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;I like it very much,&#8221; I
answered, lifting the saucer and once again attempting to put the cup to my
lips.</P>


      <P>&#8220;My niece is here,&#8221; Bliss
explained, &#8220;until such time as she can settle herself, though we are
enjoying her company so much
         that I hope that moment shan&#8217;t
be for a long while yet.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;My
mother passed away recently,&#8221; Etna said. &#8220;And unfortunately I
was forced to put her house up for sale. I am staying with
         my aunt
and uncle until such time as a settlement of the estate can be
made.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;I am sorry about your
mother,&#8221; I said, though how could I have been at all sorry if such an
event &#8212; even death &#8212; had brought
         Etna Bliss to Thrupp?
&#8220;I hope it was not sudden.&#8221;
      </P>



<P>&#8220;No, she had been ill for some time.&#8221;</P>



<P>&#8220;And your father?&#8221; I asked.</P>



<P>&#8220;My father passed away some years ago,&#8221; she said.</P>



      <P>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; I said.</P>



<P>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I also have two sisters, who
are married.&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;I see. And where was
your house?&#8221;</P>


      <P>&#8220;In Exeter.&#8221;</P>



      <P>&#8220;Etna&#8217;s arrival is most fortuitous,&#8221;
Bliss said, &#8220;since my daughter and her husband are in San Francisco,
visiting his family
         for Christmas.&#8221;
      </P>



      <P>&#8220;I see,&#8221; I said again, remembering vaguely a thin,
smartly dressed young woman who had sometimes accompanied Bliss to college

social occasions.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Evelyn and I
should be quite lonely without Etna and my granddaughter in residence. I
hope she shall stay on long after my
         daughter returns.&#8221;

</P>


      <P>I am certain it was then that I first saw a
faint look of alarm pass across the features of the woman who sat opposite
to
         me, and I believe I understood at once that the prospect of
confinement within those overfurnished rooms was not one that
         Etna
Bliss relished. Perhaps she, too, felt the oxygen being sucked from her
body by the side tables and the spiky vines.
         At that moment, a
door within me opened.
      </P>


      <P>I sat forward,
already a petitioner.</P>


      <P>&#8220;You have a most
excellent escort in your uncle, I am sure,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but I
should be delighted to show you some of the modest
         treasures
Thrupp has to offer, namely the Metcalf Library and the Elliot Collection.
Have you been to either?&#8221;
      </P>



<P>&#8220;No, I have not,&#8221; she said, and I sensed once again that the
prospect of leaving that house might not be an entirely unpleasant

one to her.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;Etna has been helpful
with my granddaughter, Aurelia,&#8221; Bliss said by way of explanation.
&#8220;But I am afraid we have kept her
         from enjoying herself with
persons her own age.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>I wondered
how old Etna Bliss was exactly. Surely twenty-four at the least, but not
more than twenty-eight? Just off the cusp
         of marriageable. I
thought I detected in Etna a slightly new scrutiny of me as well, one that
had been summoned forth by my
         bold petition. I wished then I had
spent the necessary minutes that morning at my toilet so as to present a
more pleasing
         and prosperous aspect, both to her and to Bliss. He
would not think a professor&#8217;s salary an adequate sum on which to
raise
         a family (and indeed it was not), and I should have to
inform him, when the moment was appropriate, that in fact I was in

possession of a modest fortune and could afford to keep a wife. I let my
thoughts run ahead in this fantastical manner until
         Etna abruptly
stood.
      </P>


      <P>&#8220;I fear I have left my aunt
too long,&#8221; she said. She put out her hand. &#8220;Good-bye, Professor
Van Tassel.&#8221;</P>


      <P>Again, her hand was warm in
my own. I could not help glancing once more at the presentation of her
bosom, a lovely promontory
         that seemingly begged to be examined,
and I wondered then (how quickly thoughts of possession cause jealousy to
blossom) if
         some other man had once put his hand there, if, in
fact, this handsome and stately creature before me had had many lovers.

Perhaps this thought &#8212; and certainly my wayward glance &#8212;
betrayed me, for she put a hand to the very place I studied, as if

to cover herself.
      </P>


      <P>And then she was
gone.</P>


      <P>I exchanged some further pleasantries with
Bliss, so as not to seem rude, but it was all I could do to linger even a
moment
         longer in that fetid greenhouse, craving as I did not only
a breath of fresh air but also an opportunity to think upon the

person of Etna Bliss and add to my small cache of memories, which I should
continue to mine ceaselessly in her absence: a
         half dozen
sentences, the strain of black-and-bronze silk over a bosom, and an
entirely naked, if fleeting, look of fear at
         the prospect of
imprisonment. Armed with these precious, if fragile, possessions, I then
went in search of my breakfast.
      </P>


      <P>The view
outside my window has deteriorated from the muted blues of the Vermont
hills and the navy ribbon of the Connecticut
         River as we make our
way south from White River Junction, where I boarded the train. I have had
the good fortune to secure
         a compartment to myself on this, the
first leg of my journey; and as I shall be taking a sleeper from New York
City, I have
         hope of remaining secluded, which is what I wished
for when I made the booking. I confess that I am somewhat nervous about

the prospect of a visit to southern Florida, since I have heard worrying
tales of scorpions and fire ants and malaria-ridden
         mosquitoes, as
well as the terrible heat. Accordingly, I have packed, amongst my books and
papers and Etna&#8217;s tin cake box,
         two white linen suits,
several thin cotton shirts, and a new pair of canvas shoes. My only
difficulty will be my mourning
         clothes, which I cannot avoid,
since I shall have to wear them to my sister&#8217;s funeral, the point of
my journey. I had these
         garments taken out of storage and
delivered to my tailor directly for pressing, for I could not bear to have
to look at them,
         the clothes giving off, as they must, the scent
not only of death, but also of nearly annihilating guilt &#8212; not to
mention
         the heart&#8217;s ruin.
      </P>



<P>We are passing now the mill towns of Holyoke and Chicopee in
Massachusetts, blights upon the New England landscape that, however

necessary, always put me in mind of the drearier essays of Hazlitt and
Carlyle. But I have found, if I narrow my eyes just
         so, that I can
blur this geography somewhat and fix my gaze upon only those attributes of
these cities that are bearable:
         the uneven planes of glass in the
windows of the abandoned mill buildings, for example; or a polished
black-and-maroon automobile
         parked intriguingly at the end of a
deserted street; or a woman in a short skirt and kerchief fighting her way
against the
         wind toward a church. Perhaps it is this trick of
willfully blurred but occasionally keen vision, or the rocking of the
moving
         compartment, or the comforting clacking of the train wheels
upon the rails, or, more likely, the idea of a desk (a table,

really), on which I have set my pen and notebook, inside a moving vehicle
&#8212; the sense of one&#8217;s own library at speed &#8212; that

invites me now to begin a personal narrative I have long wanted to write,
but for which I have always lacked the necessary
         strength . . .
(And in that ellipsis, I have just engaged in a lengthy debate with myself
as to whether or not to reveal,
         with complete honesty, the events
I wish to record, and I have decided that this document will be as
worthless as a floating
         fragment of ash if I resort to fiction,
even fiction by omission. So I will tell the entire truth on these pages,
even if
         this causes me the greatest pain &#8212; and it will, it
will!) . . . (Though I must add, in a further parenthesis, that I am only

too aware that I can cross out offending sentences later and recopy the
text and then edit the narrative should I find the
         resulting truth
too unbearable to read. And is this not so for every story one writes or
speaks in one&#8217;s lifetime? How, for
         example, will the death
of my sister be portrayed to me when I reach my destination? Will the
anecdotes of the death watch
         not change radically depending on the
teller of the tale and on the details <I>which have been left out,</I> such
as particular physical agonies that a daughter or a cousin might deem too
unseemly to reveal?)
      </P>


      <P>I have some
understanding of the potential benefits of committing one&#8217;s thoughts
&#8212; and in this case, one&#8217;s memories &#8212; to paper,

for I have published various monographs and essays within my field, most
notably my celebrated treatise on Scott&#8217;s <I>Marmion,</I> and my less
well known but no less critically well received commentary upon the Sir
Roger de Coverley Papers in <I>The Spectator.</I> Of course, such a venture
as that upon which I now embark this twentieth day of September 1933 is
filled more with terror
         than with imagined reward, for I know not
what feelings such a narrative may evoke; but I am determined to do so for
the sake
         of my son, Nicodemus, who will almost certainly one day
ask a question it will take all of his father&#8217;s courage to answer.
