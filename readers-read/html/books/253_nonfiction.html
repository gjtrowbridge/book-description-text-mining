THE AIR STILL SMELLED OF CHARCOAL when I arrived in Venice three days after the fire. As it happened, the timing of my
visit was purely coincidental. I had made plans, months before, to come to Venice for a few weeks in the off-season in
order to enjoy the city without the crush of other tourists.
</p>
<p>"If there had been a wind Monday night," the water-taxi driver told me as we came across the lagoon from the airport,
"there wouldn't be a Venice to come to."
</p>
<p>"How did it happen?" I asked.
</p>
<p>The taxi driver shrugged. "How do all these things happen?"
</p>
<p>It was early February, in the middle of the peaceful lull that settles over Venice every year between New Year's Day
and Carnival. The tourists had gone, and in their absence the Venice they inhabited had all but closed down. Hotel
lobbies and souvenir shops stood virtually empty. Gondolas lay tethered to poles and covered in blue tarpaulin.
Unbought copies of the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> remained on newsstand racks all day, and pigeons abandoned
sparse pickings in St. Mark's Square to scavenge for crumbs in other parts of the city.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other Venice, the one inhabited by Venetians, was as busy as
ever-the neighborhood shops, the vegetable stands, the fish markets, the wine bars. For these few weeks, Venetians
could stride through their city without having to squeeze past dense clusters of slow-moving tourists. The city
breathed, its pulse quickened. Venetians had Venice all to themselves.
</p>
<p>But the atmosphere was subdued. People spoke in hushed, dazed tones of the sort one hears when there has been a sudden
death in the family. The subject was on everyone's lips. Within days I had heard about it in such detail I felt as if I
had been there myself.
</p>
<p>IT HAPPENED ON MONDAY EVENING, January 29, 1996.
</p>
<p>Shortly before nine o'clock, Archimede Seguso sat down at the dinner table and unfolded his napkin. Before joining him,
his wife went into the living room to lower the curtains, which was her long-standing evening ritual. Signora Seguso
knew very well that no one could see in through the windows, but it was her way of enfolding her family in a domestic
embrace. The Segusos lived on the third floor of Ca' Capello, a sixteenth-century house in the heart of Venice. A
narrow canal wrapped around two sides of the building before flowing into the Grand Canal a short distance away.
</p>
<p>Signor Seguso waited patiently at the table. He was eighty-six-tall, thin, his posture still erect. A fringe of wispy
white hair and  flaring eyebrows gave him the look of a kindly sorcerer, full of wonder and surprise. He had an
animated face and sparkling eyes that captivated everyone who met him. If you happened to be in his presence for any
length of time, however, your eye would eventually be drawn to his hands.
</p>
<p>They were large, muscular hands, the hands of an artisan whose work demanded physical strength. For seventy-five years,
Signor Seguso had stood in front of a blazing-hot glassworks furnace-ten, twelve, eighteen hours a day-holding a heavy
steel pipe in his hands, turning it to prevent the dollop of molten glass at the other end from drooping to one side or
the other, pausing to blow into it to inflate the glass, then laying it across his workbench, still turning it with his
left hand while, with a pair of tongs in his right hand, pulling, pinching, and coaxing the glass into the shape of
graceful vases, bowls, and goblets.
</p>
<p>After all those years of turning the steel pipe hour after hour, Signor Seguso's left hand had molded itself around the
pipe until it became permanently cupped, as if the pipe were always in it. His cupped hand was the proud mark of his
craft, and this was why the artist who painted his portrait some years ago had taken particular care to show the curve
in his left hand.
</p>
<p>Men in the Seguso family had been glassmakers since the fourteenth century. Archimede was the twenty-first generation
and one of the greatest of them all. He could sculpt heavy pieces out of solid glass and blow vases so thin and fragile
they could barely be touched. He was the first glassmaker ever to see his work honored with an exhibition in the Doge's
Palace in St. Mark's Square. Tiffany sold his pieces in its Fifth Avenue store.
</p>
<p>Archimede Seguso had been making glass since the age of eleven, and by the time he was twenty, he had earned the
nickname "Mago del Fuoco" (Wizard of Fire). He no longer had the stamina to stand in front of a hot and howling furnace
eighteen hours a day, but he worked every day nonetheless, and with undiminished pleasure. On this particular day, in
fact, he had risen at his usual hour of 4:30 A.M., convinced as always that the pieces he was about to make would be
more beautiful than any he had ever made before.
</p>
<p>In the living room, Signora Seguso paused to look out the window before lowering the curtain. She noticed that the air
had become hazy, and she mused aloud that a winter fog had set in. In response, Signor Seguso remarked from the other
room that it must have come in very quickly, because he had seen the quarter moon in a clear sky only a few minutes
before.
</p>
<p>The living room window looked across a small canal at the back of the Fenice Opera House, thirty feet away. Rising
above it in the distance, some one hundred yards away, the theater's grand entrance wing appeared to be shrouded in
mist. Just as she started to lower the curtain, Signora Seguso saw a flash. She thought it was lightning. Then she saw
another flash, and this time she knew it was fire.
</p>
<p>"Papa!" she cried out. "The Fenice is on fire!"
</p>
<p>Signor Seguso came quickly to the window. More flames flickered at the front of the theater, illuminating what Signora
Seguso had thought was mist but had in fact been smoke. She rushed to the telephone and dialed 115 for the fire
brigade. Signor Seguso went into his bedroom and stood at the corner window, which was even closer to the Fenice than
the living room window.
</p>
<p>Between the fire and the Segusos' house lay a jumble of buildings that constituted the Fenice. The part on fire was
farthest away, the chaste neoclassical entrance wing with its formal reception rooms, known collectively as the
Apollonian rooms. Then came the main body of the theater with its elaborately rococo auditorium, and finally the vast
backstage area. Flaring out from both sides of the auditorium and the backstage were clusters of smaller,
interconnected buildings like the one that housed the scenery workshop immediately across the narrow canal from Signor
Seguso.
</p>
<p>Signora Seguso could not get through to the fire brigade, so she dialed 112 for the police.
</p>
<p>The enormity of what was happening outside his window stunned Signor Seguso. The Gran Teatro La Fenice was one of the
splendors of Venice; it was arguably the most beautiful opera house in the world, and one of the most significant. The
Fenice had commissioned dozens of operas that had premiered on its stage-Verdi's <i>La Traviata</i> and
<i>Rigoletto</i>, Igor Stravinsky's <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, Benjamin Britten's <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. For
two hundred years, audiences had delighted in the sumptuous clarity of the Fenice's acoustics, the magnificence of its
five tiers of gilt-encrusted boxes, and the baroque fantasy of it all. Signor and Signora Seguso had always taken a box
for the season, and over the years they had been given increasingly desirable locations until they finally found
themselves next to the royal box.
</p>
<p>Signora Seguso had no luck getting through to the police either, and now she was becoming frantic. She called upstairs
to the apartment where her son Gino lived with his wife and their son, Antonio. Gino was still out at the Seguso glass
factory in Murano. Antonio was visiting a friend near the Rialto.
</p>
<p>Signor Seguso stood silently at his bedroom window, watching as the flames raced across the entire top floor of the
entrance wing. He knew that, for all its storied loveliness, the Fenice was at this moment an enormous pile of
exquisite kindling. Inside a thick shell of Istrian stone lined with brick, the structure was made entirely of
wood-wooden beams, wooden floors, wooden walls-richly embellished with wood carvings, sculpted stucco, and
papier-m�ch�, all of it covered with layer upon layer of lacquer and gilt. Signor Seguso was aware, too, that the
scenery workshop just across the canal from his house was stocked with solvents and, most worrisome of all, cylinders
of propane gas that were used for welding and soldering.
</p>
<p>Signora Seguso came back into the room to say she had finally spoken with the police.
</p>
<p>"They already knew about the fire," she said. "They told me we should leave the house at once." She looked over her
husband's shoulder and stifled a scream; the flames had moved closer in the short time she had been away from the
window. They were now advancing through the four smaller reception halls toward the main body of the theater, in their
direction.
</p>
<p>Archimede Seguso stared into the fire with an appraising eye. He opened the window, and a gust of bitter-cold air
rushed in. The wind was blowing to the southwest. The Segusos were due west of the theater, however, and Signor Seguso
calculated that if the wind did not change direction or pick up strength, the fire would advance toward the other side
of the Fenice rather than in their direction.
</p>
<p>"Now, Nandina," he said softly, "stay calm. We're not in any danger."
</p>
<p>The Segusos' house was only one of many buildings close to the Fenice. Except for Campo San Fantin, a small plaza at
the front of the theater, the Fenice was hemmed in by old and equally flammable buildings, many of them attached to it
or separated from it by only four or five feet. This was not at all unusual in Venice, where building space had always
been at a premium. Seen from above, Venice resembled a jigsaw puzzle of terra-cotta rooftops. Passages between some of
the buildings were so narrow one could not walk through them with an open umbrella. It had become a specialty of
Venetian burglars to escape from the scene of a crime by leaping from roof to roof. If the fire in the Fenice were able
to make the same sort of leap, it would almost certainly destroy a sizable swath of Venice.
</p>
<p>The Fenice itself was dark. It had been closed five months for renovations and was due to reopen in a month. The canal
along its rear fa�ade was also closed-empty-having been sealed off and drained so work crews could dredge the silt and
sludge from it and repair its walls for the first time in forty years. The canal between the Segusos' building and the
back of the Fenice was now a deep, muddy gulch with a tangle of exposed pipes and a few pieces of heavy machinery
sitting in puddles at the bottom. The empty canal would make it impossible for fireboats to reach the Fenice, and,
worse than that, it would deprive them of a source of water. Venetian firemen depended on water pumped directly from
the canals to put out fires. The city had no system of fire hydrants.
</p>
<p>THE FENICE WAS NOW RINGED BY A TUMULT OF SHOUTS and running footsteps. Tenants, routed from their houses by the police,
crossed paths with patrons coming out of the Ristorante Antico Martini. A dozen bewildered guests rolled suitcases out
of the Hotel La Fenice, asking directions to the Hotel Saturnia, where they had been told to go. Into their midst, a
wild-eyed woman wearing only a nightgown came stumbling from her house into Campo San Fantin screaming hysterically.
She threw herself to the ground in front of the theater, flailing her arms and rolling on the pavement. Several waiters
came out of the Antico Martini and led her inside.
</p>
<p>Two fireboats managed to navigate to a water-filled canal a short distance from the Fenice. Their hoses were not long
enough to reach around the intervening buildings, however, so the firemen dragged them through the kitchen window at
the back of the Antico Martini and out through the dining room into Campo San Fantin. They aimed their nozzles at
flames burning furiously in a top-floor window of the theater, but the water pressure was too low. The arc of water
barely reached the windowsill. The fire went on leaping and taunting and sucking up great turbulent currents of air
that set the flames snapping like brilliant red sails in a violent wind.
</p>
<p>Several policemen struggled with the massive front door of the Fenice, but to no avail. One of them drew his pistol and
fired three shots at the lock. The door opened. Two firemen rushed in and disappeared into a dense white wall of smoke.
Moments later they came running out. "It's too late," said one. "It's burning like straw."
</p>
<p>The wail of sirens now filled the air as police and firemen raced up and down the Grand Canal in motorboats, spanking
up huge butterfly wings of spray as they bounced through the wakes of other boats. About an hour after the first alarm,
the city's big fire launch pulled up at the landing stage behind Haig's Bar. Its high-powered rigs would at last be
able to pump water the two hundred yards from the Grand Canal to the Fenice. Dozens of firemen ran hoses from the fire
launch into Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, feverishly coupling sections together, but it was immediately apparent that
the hoses were of different gauges. Leaks sprayed from the couplings, but the firemen carried the linked hoses, such as
they were, up to the rooftops around the Fenice anyway. They directed half the water onto the theater in an attempt to
contain the fire and the rest of it onto adjacent buildings. Fire Commandant Alfio Pini had already made a momentous
strategic decision: The Fenice was lost; save the city.
</p>
<p>WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, Count Girolamo Marcello was midsentence in a conversation over dinner with his son on the top
floor of his palace less than a minute's walk from the front of the Fenice. Earlier in the day, Count Marcello had
learned that the exiled Russian poet and Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky had died suddenly of a heart attack, at
fifty-five, in New York. Brodsky had been a passionate lover of Venice and a friend and houseguest of Marcello's. It
was while he was staying in Marcello's palace, in fact, that Brodsky had written his last book, Watermark, a lyrical
reflection on Venice. That afternoon Marcello had spoken by phone with Brodsky's widow, Maria, and they had discussed
the possibility of burying Brodsky in Venice. Marcello knew that this would not be easily arranged. Every available
plot on the burial island of San Michele had been spoken for years ago. It was generally understood that any new
arrival, even a native Venetian, would be dug up in ten years and moved to a common burial site farther out in the
lagoon. But for a non-Venetian, Jewish atheist, gaining approval for even a temporary burial would be a quest fraught
with obstacles. Still, there had been notable exceptions. Igor Stravinsky had been buried on San Michele, and so had
Sergei Diaghilev and Ezra Pound. They had all been buried in the Anglican and Greek Orthodox section, and all would be
allowed to remain there in perpetuity. So there was reason to hope that Brodsky could be buried there, too, and this
was on Marcello's mind when the lights went out.
</p>
<p>Father and son sat in darkness for a while, expecting the lights to come back on. Then they heard the sirens, lots of
them, many more than usual.
</p>
<p>"Let's go up and see what's happened," said Marcello. They headed upstairs to the wooden deck on the roof, the
<i>altana</i>, and as soon as they opened the door, they saw the raging fire.
</p>
<p>Marcello decided they should leave the house at once. They descended the stairs, feeling their way in the darkness,
Marcello wondering if the six-hundred-year-old palace was doomed. If it was, the most impressive private library in
Venice would disappear with it. Marcello's library occupied most of the second floor. It was an architectural delight,
a high-ceilinged space complete with a wraparound wooden gallery that could be reached only by climbing a secret
stairway hidden behind a panel in the wall. The floor-to-ceiling shelves held forty thousand volumes of private and
state papers, some of them more than a thousand years old. The collection amounted to a treasure trove of Venetian
history, and Marcello regularly made it available to scholars. He himself spent long hours sitting in a throne-like
black leather armchair perusing the archives, especially the papers of the Marcello family, which was one of the oldest
in Venice. Marcello's ancestors included a fifteenth-century doge, or head of state. The Marcellos had, in fact, been
among the families that built the Fenice and owned it until just before World War II, when the municipality of Venice
took it over. . . .
