The man who was responsible for this whole mix-up was
our own Arcadio Carnabuci, the olive grower. Demoralized by
the rejection he had suffered from every woman he had
approached in the region, and exhausted by his debilitating
loneliness, he grew desperate. At precisely the moment this
happened, there was a knock on the door and he was seduced
by the glib patter of a passing peddler. Within seconds he had
purchased at great expense a handful of seeds the gypsy guaranteed
would bring him love.</p>

<p>Gleefully the peddler pocketed the cash and ran off before
the olive grower could change his mind. But he need not have
worried. Arcadio Carnabuci was delighted with his purchase
and couldn't wait to change his life. Nobody could have predicted
the way things would turn out, but I will faithfully
record it all in these pages, for I myself was intimately involved
with everything that happened.</p>

<p>Yes, responding to the irresistible surge of nature, Arcadio
Carnabuci sowed the seeds of his love early in the spring, when the short days of fleeting February were hurrying into March,
and already the earth was coming alive. Mists hung around the
skirts of the hills like tulle, and on the plains tiny figures
became visible, muffled against the cold, sowing the crops
where the snow had melted.</p>

<p>Arcadio Carnabuci spent the daylight hours on the rungs of
a ladder, pruning the olive trees that had been in the care of his
family for one thousand years. But his mind was not on his
olives. No. It was on love.</p>

<p>In the crisp air that clouded with his breath, he could feel
the tension, taut like the twigs that snapped beneath his knife.
Overnight, the almond trees poured forth their blossoms. Not
to be outdone, the cherry trees followed; so, too, did the persimmons,
the chestnuts, and the pomegranates. The sticky
buds on the willows gave forth curly catkins, and the meadows
exploded into a blaze of spring flowers: lily of the valley, dwarf
narcissi, bluebells, crocuses, and irises formed a carpet of dazzling
color. Wild asparagus and sweet-smelling herbs perfumed
the newborn air, and up on the mountains, rhododendrons
bloomed.</p>

<p>Arcadio Carnabuci could feel the earth's energy through the
soles of his stout boots. This effervescence bubbled up into his
legs and made him dance in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm dancing," he cried to no one in particular, all the
more amazed because he had never danced a step in his life
before. And he started to laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm dancing."</p>

<p>And so he was. Slowly at first, but as his confidence grew, he
threw himself into the rhythm of the dance. His arms joined in;
his feet, usually leaden, became weightless. They bounced off
the hardened earth and soared into the air. He dipped and dived
like a swallow. He gyrated his hips. He flung his head about.</p>

<p>Those that saw him turned up their coat collars and examined
their mittens to cover their embarrassment. Arcadio
Carnabuci, always strange, was growing stranger. That day my
colleague Concetta Crocetta, the district nurse, received seven
separate reports calling for Arcadio Carnabuci to be interred in
the manicomio at Cascia for the benefit of all in the region. Yet
when we trotted past the olive grove to witness Arcadio
Carnabuci's antics, we saw it was nothing more than high spirits
connected with the coming of spring. Smiling indulgently,
she gave me a tap with her little heel to encourage me. Back
then she was never rough with my tender flanks, and we set off
again for home.</p>

<p>The impulse that was tickling away at Arcadio Carnabuci
was not confined to himself and the plants. No. Animals felt it,
too. The spiders in their spangled webs yearned for love and
spun sonnets of a fragile and unbearable beauty, glazed with
tears of dew. Scorpions in dark corners clipped their castanets
in courtship, then curled up in pairs in discarded shoes, snug as
bugs. The mice in the rafters scurried about gathering wisps of
stolen cotton, torn paper, and bits of fluff and formed them into
cozy nests from which they subsequently brought forth blind
babies the size of peas. The humble newts in the waterspout sung out in deep voices. The frogs and the toads joined in with
them, and soon a chorus of magical croaking was filling the air.
The music they made was so beautiful it made those that heard
it weep and yearn for the life of an amphibian so they could
unlock the secret of the song. Already the beady-eyed blackbirds
were busily building their nests, watched slyly by the
cuckoos, who were broadcasting the news, for those that didn't
already know it: spring had sprung. Deep in the oak woods, the
wild boar grunted his serenade, while, in the sty, his domestic
cousins spooned. Deer frolicked, hares chased. High up in the
mountains the wolf howled his suit, and the shy brown bears
hugged in their caves.</p>

<p>Arcadio Carnabuci could not help but succumb to the rosy
glow that wrapped itself around the region, and his loins
hummed with a cruel expectation that in his lonely circumstances
he could do little to fulfill. But he had faith in his love
seeds, and in this fertile climate their promise would surely
come to fruition.</p>

<p>It was then that he sowed them. He picked the moment with
care. In the watery sunlight, frail but willing. Under glass. To
keep them warm. They were more beans than seeds. Pleasantly
plump, and a palish pink in color. Little crescent moons. He
could feel a tingling in the beans; like jumping beans, they possessed
the same energy as everything else around him. He held
them for a while in the palm of his hand, familiarizing himself
with them, scrutinizing them through his half-moon glasses,
behind which his eyes seemed enormous, and every pore and hair follicle was magnified a thousand times. Even the beans
could feel the strength of his hope, and the plucky little creatures
were determined not to disappoint him.
