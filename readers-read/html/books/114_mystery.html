ONE  <br /><br />Copenhagen, Denmark  <br />Thursday, June 22, The Present  <br />2:50 pm  <br /><br />Cotton Malone spotted the knife at the same time he saw Stephanie Nelle.  He was sitting at a table outside the Caf&#233; Nikolaj, comfortable in a white  lattice chair. The sunny afternoon was pleasant and H&#248;jbro Plads, the  popular Danish square that spanned out before him, bristled with people.  The caf&#233; was doing its usual brisk business&#8212;the mood feverish&#8212;and for the  past half hour he&#8217;d been waiting for Stephanie.<br /><br />    She was a petite woman, in her sixties, though she never confirmed her age  and the Justice Department personnel records that Malone once saw  contained only a winking n/a in the space reserved for date of birth. Her  dark hair was streaked with waves of silver, and her brown  eyes offered  both the compassionate look of a liberal and the fiery glint of a  prosecutor. Two presidents had tried to make her attorney general, but  she&#8217;d turned both offers down. One attorney general had lobbied hard to  fire her&#8212;especially after she was enlisted by the FBI to investigate  him&#8212;but the White House nixed the idea since, among other things,  Stephanie Nelle was scrupulously honest.<br /><br />    In contrast, the man with the knife was short and stout, with narrow  features and brush-cut hair. Something haunted loomed on his East European  face&#8212;a forlornness that worried Malone more than the glistening blade&#8212;and  he was dressed casually in denim pants and a blood-red jacket.<br /><br />    Malone rose from his seat but kept his eyes trained on Stephanie.<br /><br />    He thought of shouting a warning, but she was too far away and there was  too much noise between them. His view of her was mo-  mentarily blocked by one of the modernistic sculptures that dotted H&#248;jbro  Plads&#8212;this one of an obscenely obese woman, lying naked on her belly, her  obtrusive buttocks rounded like windswept mountains. When Stephanie  appeared from the other side of the cast bronze, the man with the knife  had moved closer and Malone watched as he severed a strap that draped her  left shoulder, jerked a leather bag free, then shoved Stephanie to the  flagstones.<br /><br />    A woman screamed and commotion erupted at the sight of a purse snatcher  brandishing a knife.<br /><br />    Red Jacket rushed ahead, Stephanie&#8217;s bag in hand, and shouldered people  out of his way. A few pushed back. The thief angled left, around another  of the bronzed sculptures, and finally broke into a run. His route seemed  aimed at K&#248;bmagergade, a pedestrian-only lane that twisted north, out of  H&#248;jbro Plads, deeper into the city&#8217;s shopping district.<br /><br />    Malone bounded from the table, determined to cut off the assailant before  he could turn the corner, but a cluster of bicycles blocked his way. He  circled the cycles and sprinted forward, partially orbiting a fountain  before tackling his prey.<br /><br />    They slammed into hard stone, Red Jacket taking most of the impact, and  Malone immediately noticed that his opponent was muscular. Red Jacket,  undaunted by the attack, rolled once, then brought a knee into Malone&#8217;s  stomach.<br /><br />    The breath left him in a rush and his guts churned.<br /><br />    Red Jacket sprang to his feet and raced up K&#248;bmagergade.<br /><br />    Malone stood, but instantly crouched over and sucked a couple of shallow  breaths.<br /><br />    Damn. He was out of practice.<br /><br />    He caught hold of himself and resumed pursuit, his quarry now possessing a  fifty-foot head start. Malone had not seen the knife during their  struggle, but as he plowed up the street between shops he saw that the man  still grasped the leather bag. His chest burned, but he was closing the  gap.<br /><br />    Red Jacket wrenched a flower cart away from a scraggly old man, one of  many carts that lined both H&#248;jbro Plads and K&#248;bmagergade. Malone hated the  vendors, who enjoyed blocking his bookshop, especially on Saturdays. Red  Jacket flung the cart down the cobbles in Malone&#8217;s direction. He could not  let the cart run free&#8212;too many people on the street, including children&#8212;so  he darted right, grasped hold, and twisted it to a stop.<br /><br />    He glanced back and saw Stephanie round the corner onto K&#248;bmagergade,  along with a policeman. They were half a football field away, and he had  no time to wait.<br /><br />    Malone dashed ahead, wondering where the man was heading. Perhaps he&#8217;d  left a vehicle, or a driver was waiting where K&#248;bmagergade emptied into  another of Copenhagen&#8217;s busy squares, Hauser Plads. He hoped not. That  place was a nightmare of congestion, beyond the web of people-only lanes  that formed the shoppers&#8217; mecca known as Str&#248;get. His thighs ached from  the unexpected workout, the muscles barely recalling his days with the  Navy and the Justice Department. After a year of voluntary retirement, his  exercise regimen would not impress his former employer.<br /><br />    Ahead loomed the Round Tower, nestled firmly against the Trinity Church  like a thermos bound to a lunch pail. The burly cylindrical structure rose  nine stories. Denmark&#8217;s Christian IV had erected it   in 1642, and the symbol of his reign&#8212;a gilded 4 embraced by a c&#8212;  glistened on its somber brick edifice. Five streets intersected where the  Round Tower stood, and Red Jacket could choose any one of them for his  escape.<br /><br />    Police cars appeared.<br /><br />    One screeched to a stop on the south side of the Round Tower. Another came  from farther down K&#248;bmagergade, blocking any escape to the north. Red  Jacket was now contained in the plaza that encircled the Round Tower. His  quarry hesitated, seeming to appraise the situation, then scampered right  and disappeared inside the Round Tower.<br /><br />    What was the fool doing? There was no way out besides the ground-floor  portal. But maybe Red Jacket didn&#8217;t know that.<br /><br />    Malone ran to the entrance. He knew the man in the ticket booth. The  Norwegian spent many hours in Malone&#8217;s bookshop, English literature his  passion.<br /><br />    &#8220;Arne, where did that man go?&#8221; he asked in Danish, catching his wind.<br /><br />    &#8220;Ran right by without paying.&#8221;<br /><br />    &#8220;Anybody up there?&#8221;<br /><br />    &#8220;An older couple went up a little while ago.&#8221;<br /><br />    No elevator or stairs led to the top. Instead, a spiral causeway wound a  path straight to the summit, originally installed so that bulky  seventeenth-century astronomical instruments could be wheeled up. The  story local tour guides liked to tell was of how Russia&#8217;s Peter the Great  once rode up on horseback while his empress followed in a carriage.<br /><br />    Malone could hear footfalls echoing from the flooring above. He shook his  head at what he knew awaited him. &#8220;Tell the police we&#8217;re up there.&#8221;<br /><br />    He started to run.<br /><br />    Halfway up the spiraling incline he passed a door leading into the Large  Hall. The glassed entrance was locked, the lights off. Ornamented double  windows lined the tower&#8217;s outer walls, but each was iron-barred. He  listened again and could still hear running from above.<br /><br />    He continued ahead, his breathing growing thick and hampered. He slowed  his pace when he passed a medieval planet plotter affixed high on the  wall. He knew the exit onto the roof platform was just a few feet away,  around the ramp&#8217;s final bend.<br /><br />    He heard no more footsteps.<br /><br />    He crept forward and stepped through the archway. An octago-  nal observatory&#8212;not from Christian IV&#8217;s time, but a more recent  incarnation&#8212;rose in the center, with a wide terrace encircling.<br /><br />    To his left a decorative iron fence surrounded the observatory, its only  entrance chained shut. On his right, intricate wrought-iron latticework  lined the tower&#8217;s outer edge. Beyond the low railing loomed the city&#8217;s  red-tiled rooftops and green spires.<br /><br />    He rounded the platform and found an elderly man lying prone. Behind the  body, Red Jacket stood with a knife to an older woman&#8217;s throat, his arm  encasing her chest. She seemed to want to scream, but fear quelled her  voice.<br /><br />    &#8220;Keep still,&#8221; Malone said to her in Danish.<br /><br />    He studied Red Jacket. The haunted look was still there in the dark,  almost mournful eyes. Beads of sweat glistened in the bright sun.  Everything signaled that Malone should not step any closer. Footfalls from  below signaled that the police would arrive in a few moments.<br /><br />    &#8220;How about you cool down?&#8221; he asked, trying English.<br /><br />    He could see the man understood him, but the knife stayed in place. Red  Jacket&#8217;s gaze kept darting away, off to the sky then back. He seemed  unsure of himself and that concerned Malone even more. Desperate people  always did desperate things.<br /><br />    &#8220;Put the knife down. The police are coming. There&#8217;s no way out.&#8221;<br /><br />    Red Jacket looked to the sky again, then refocused on Malone. Indecision  stared back at him. What was this? A purse snatcher who flees to the top  of a hundred-foot tower with nowhere to go?<br /><br />    Footfalls from below grew louder.<br /><br />    &#8220;The police are here.&#8221;<br /><br />    Red Jacket backed closer to the iron railing but kept his grip tight on  the elderly woman. Malone sensed the steeliness of an ultimatum forcing  some choice, so he made clear again, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way out.&#8221;<br /><br />    Red Jacket tightened his grip on the woman&#8217;s chest, then he staggered  back, now firmly against the waist-high outer railing, nothing beyond him  and his hostage but air.<br /><br />    The eyes lost their panic and a sudden calm swept over the man. He shoved  the old woman forward and Malone caught her before   she lost her balance. Red Jacket made the sign of the cross and, with  Stephanie&#8217;s bag in hand, pivoted out over the railing, screamed one  word&#8212;&#8220;beauseant&#8221;&#8212;then slashed the knife across his throat as his body  plunged to the street.<br /><br />    The woman howled as the police emerged from the portal.<br /><br />    Malone let her go and rushed to the rail.<br /><br />    Red Jacket lay sprawled on the cobbles one hundred feet below.<br /><br />    He turned and looked back to the sky, past the flagpole atop the  observatory, the Danish Dannebrog&#8212;a white cross upon a red banner&#8212;limp in  the still air.<br /><br />    What had the man been looking at? And why did he jump?<br /><br />    He gazed back down and saw Stephanie elbowing her way through the growing  crowd. Her leather bag lay a few feet from the dead man   and he watched as she yanked it from the cobbles, then dissolved back into  the spectators. He followed her with his gaze as she plowed through the  people and scuttled away, down one of the streets that led from the Round  Tower, deeper into the busy Str&#248;get, never looking back.<br /><br />    He shook his head at her hasty retreat and muttered, &#8220;What the hell?&#8221;
