Do you do divorce work?" the woman said.
<BR><BR>
"I do," I said.
<BR><BR>
"Are you any good?"
<BR><BR>
"I am," I said.
<BR><BR>
"I don't want likelihood," she said. "Or guesswork. I need evidence that will stand up in court."
<BR><BR>
"That's not up to me," I said. "That's up to the evidence."
<BR><BR>
She sat quietly in my client chair and thought about that.
<BR><BR>
"You're telling me you won't manufacture it," she said.
<BR><BR>
"Yes," I said.
<BR><BR>
"You won't have to," she said. "The sonovabitch can't keep his dick in his pants for a full day."
<BR><BR>
"Must make dining out a little awkward," I said.
<BR><BR>
She ignored me. I was used to it. Mostly I amused myself.
<BR><BR>
"I always have trouble convincing people that any man would cheat on a woman like me. I mean, look at me."
<BR><BR>
"Unbelievable," I said.
<BR><BR>
"My attorneys tell me you are too expensive," she said. "But that you are probably worth it."
<BR><BR>
"The same could be remarked of Susan Silverman."
<BR><BR>
She frowned.
<BR><BR>
"Who the hell is Susan Silverman?" she said.
<BR><BR>
"Girl of my dreams."
<BR><BR>
She frowned again. Then she said, "Oh, I see. You're being cute."
<BR><BR>
"It's my nature," I said.
<BR><BR>
"Well, it's not mine," she said. "Do you want the job?"
<BR><BR>
"Sure."
<BR><BR>
"My attorneys will want a strict accounting of what you spend," she said.
<BR><BR>
"I'll bet they will," I said.
<BR><BR>
She was good-looking in kind of an old-fashioned way. Sort of womanly. Before personal trainers, and StairMasters. Like the women in Life Magazine when we were all much younger. Like she would look good in a small-waisted white polka-dot dress, and a huge straw hat with a white polka-dot band. In fact, of course, she was wearing a beige pantsuit and big pearls. Her reddish blond hair was long and thoroughly sprayed, and framed her face like the halo in a mediaeval religious painting. Her mouth was kind of thin and her eyes were small. I imagined cheating on her.
<BR><BR>
"I'm represented by Frampton and Keyes," she said. "Do you know the firm?"
<BR><BR>
"I don't."
<BR><BR>
"You'll do all further business through them. The managing partner is Randy Frampton."
<BR><BR>
"Why didn't you let them hire me," I said.
<BR><BR>
"I don't let other people make judgments for me. I wanted to look you in the eye."
<BR><BR>
I nodded.
<BR><BR>
"Do you have pictures of your husband?" I said. "Names of suspected paramours? Addresses? That sort of thing?"
<BR><BR>
"You can get all that from Randy."
<BR><BR>
"And a retainer?"
<BR><BR>
"Randy will take care of that as well."
<BR><BR>
"Good for Randy," I said. "Will he tell me your name, too?"
<BR><BR>
"I'd rather keep that confidential for now," she said. "This is a very sensitive situation."
<BR><BR>
I smiled.
<BR><BR>
"Ma'am," I said. "How long do you think it will take me to find out your name once I know who your husband is?"
<BR><BR>
"I . . ."
<BR><BR>
I smiled my sunny good-natured smile at her. I could melt polar ice caps with my sunny good-natured smile. She was no match for it.
<BR><BR>
"Marlene," she said. "Marlene Rowley. My husband is Trenton Rowley."
<BR><BR>
"How do you do," I said. "My name is Spenser."
<BR><BR>
"Of course I know your name," she said. "How do you think I got here?"
<BR><BR>
"I thought you looked up handsome in the phone book," I said. "And my picture was there."
<BR><BR>
She smiled for the first time that morning.
<BR><BR>
"Well," she said. "Maybe you are a little bit handsome in a rough sort of way."
<BR><BR>
"Tough," I said. "But sensitive."
<BR><BR>
"Perhaps," she said. "Will you speak with Randy?"
<BR><BR>
"Right away," I said.
