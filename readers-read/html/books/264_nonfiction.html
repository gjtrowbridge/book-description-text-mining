<DIV align=center>CHAPTER ONE</DIV><BR><EM><STRONG><FONT size=+1>
<DIV align=center>Declassified</DIV></FONT></STRONG></EM><BR><BR>
<DIV align=center><EM>All these years I had this nagging feeling these guys
wanted their story told</EM>.</DIV><BR>
<DIV align=center>?<EM>Bill Doran</EM></DIV>
<P>The e-mail was from Iris Chang, author of the groundbreaking bestseller
<EM>The Rape of Nanking</EM>. Iris and I had developed a professional
relationship after the publication of my first book, <EM>Flags of Our
Fathers</EM>. In her e-mail, Iris suggested I contact a man named Bill Doran in
Iowa. She said Bill had some "interesting" information.</P>
<P>This was in early February 2001. I was hearing many "interesting" war stories
at that point. <EM>Flags of Our Fathers</EM> had been published recently. The
book was about the six Iwo Jima flagraisers. One of them was my father.</P>
<P>Indeed, scarcely a day passed without someone suggesting a topic for my next
book. So I was curious as I touched his Iowa number on my New York telephone
keypad.</P>
<P>Bill quickly focused our call on a tall stack of papers on his kitchen table.
Within twenty minutes I knew I had to look Bill in the eye and see that stack. I
asked if I could catch the first plane out the next day.</P>
<P>"Sure. I'll pick you up at the airport," Bill offered. "Stay at my place.
It's just me and Stripe, my hunting dog, here. I have three empty bedrooms. You
can sleep in one."</P>
<P>Riding from the Des Moines airport in Bill's truck, I learned that Stripe was
the best hunting dog in the world and that his seventy-sixyear- old owner was a
retired lawyer. Bill and Stripe spent their days hunting and fishing. Soon Bill
and I were seated at his Formica-topped kitchen table. Between us was a pile of
paper, a bowl of popcorn, and two gin and tonics.</P>
<P>The papers were the transcript of a secret war crimes trial held on Guam in
1946. Fifty-five years earlier, Bill, a recent U.S. Naval Academy graduate, had
been ordered to attend the trial as an observer. Bill was instructed to report
to the "courtroom," a huge Quonset hut. At the entrance, a Marine guard eyed the
twenty-one-year-old. After finding Bill's name on the approved list, he shoved a
piece of paper across a table.</P>
<P>"Sign this," the Marine ordered matter-of-factly. Everybody was required
to.</P>
<P>Bill read the single-spaced navy document. The legal and binding language
informed young Bill that he was never to reveal what he would hear in that
steaming Quonset hut / courtroom.</P>
<P>Bill signed the secrecy oath and he signed another copy late that afternoon
when he left the trial. He would repeat this process every morning and every
afternoon for the trial's duration. And when it was over, Bill returned home to
Iowa. He kept silent but could not forget what he had heard.</P>
<P>Then, in 1997, Bill noticed a tiny newspaper item announcing that vast
stashes of government documents from 1946 had been declassi- fied. "When I
realized the trial was declassified," Bill said, "I thought, Maybe I can do
something for these guys now."</P>
<P>As a lawyer, Bill had spent his professional life ferreting out documents. He
made some inquiries and dedicated eleven months to following where they led.
Then one day, a boxed transcript arrived in the mail from Washington. Bill told
Stripe they weren't going hunting that day.</P>
<P>The transcript contained the full proceedings of a trial establishing the
fates of eight American airmen?Flyboys?downed in waters in the vicinity of Iwo
Jima during World War II. Each was shot down during bombing runs against Chichi
Jima, the next island north of Iwo Jima. Iwo Jima was coveted for its airstrips,
Chichi Jima for its communications stations. Powerful short- and long-wave
receivers and transmitters atop Chichi's Mount Yoake and Mount Asahi were the
critical communications link between Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo and Japanese
troops in the Pacific. The radio stations had to be destroyed, the U.S. military
decided, and the Flyboys had been charged with doing so.</P>
<P>A stack of papers my brother found in my dad's office closet after his death
in 1994 had launched me on a quest to find my father's past. Now, on Bill's
table, I was looking at the stack of papers that would become the first step in
another journey.</P><BR>
<P>On the same day my father and his buddies raised that flag on Iwo Jima,
Flyboys were held prisoner just 150 miles away on Chichi Jima. But while
everyone knows the famous Iwo Jima photo, no one knew the story of these eight
Chichi Jima Flyboys.</P>
<P>Nobody knew for a reason: For over two generations, the truth about their
demise was kept secret. The U.S. government decided the facts were so horrible
that the families were never told. Over the decades, relatives of the airmen
wrote letters and even traveled to Washington, D.C., in search of the truth.
Well-meaning bureaucrats turned them away with vague cover stories.</P>
<P>"All those years I had this nagging feeling these guys wanted their story
told," Bill said.</P>
<P>Eight mothers had gone to their graves not knowing the fates of their lost
sons. Sitting at Bill's table, I suddenly realized that now I knew what the
Flyboys' mothers had never learned.</P><BR>
<P>History buffs know that 22,000 Japanese soldiers defended Iwo Jima. Few
realize that neighboring Chichi Jima was defended by even more?Japanese troops
numbering 25,000. Whereas Iwo had flat areas suitable for assault from the sea,
Chichi had a hilly inland and a craggy coast. One Marine who later examined the
defenses of both islands told me, "Iwo was hell. Chichi would have been
impossible." Land troops?Marines?would neutralize Iwo's threat. But it was up to
the Flyboys to take out Chichi.</P>
<P>The U.S. tried to blow up Chichi Jima's communications stations for quite
some time. Beginning in June of 1944, eight months before the Iwo Jima invasion,
American aircraft carriers surrounded Chichi Jima. These floating airports
catapulted steel-encased Flyboys off their decks into the air. The mission of
these young airmen was to fly into the teeth of Chichi Jima's lethal
antiaircraft guns, somehow dodge the hot metal aimed at them, and release their
loads of bombs onto the reinforced concrete communications cubes atop the
island's twin peaks.</P>
<P>The WWII Flyboys were the first to engage in combat aviation in large
numbers. In bomber jackets, posing with thumbs up, they epitomized masculine
glamour. They were cool, and they knew it, and any earthbound fool had to know
it too. Their planes were named after girlfriends and pinups, whose curvy forms
or pretty faces sometimes adorned their sides. And inside the cockpit, the
Flyboys were lone knights in an age of mass warfare.</P>
<P>In the North Pacific in 1945, the Flyboys flew the original "missions
impossible." Climbing into 1940s-era tin cans with bombs strapped below their
feet, they hurtled off carrier decks into howling winds or took off from island
airfields. Sandwiched between blue expanses of sky and sea, Flyboys would wing
toward distant targets, dive into flak shot from huge guns, and drop their
lethal payloads. With their hearts in their throats, adrenaline pumping through
their veins, the Flyboys then had to dead-reckon their way back to a tiny speck
of landing deck or to a distant airfield their often-damaged planes never made
it to.</P>
<P>The Flyboys were part of an air war that dwarfed the land war below. In 1945,
the endgame in the northern Pacific was the incineration of Japan. This required
two layers of bombers in the sky?huge B-29s lumbering high above with their
cargo of napalm to burn cities, and smaller, lower-flying carrier-based planes
to neutralize threats to the B-29s. My father on Iwo Jima shared the same
mission with the Chichi Jima Flyboys: to make the skies safe for the B-29s.</P>
<P>Japanese military experts would later agree that the napalm dropped by these
B-29s had more to do with Japan's surrender than the atomic bombs. Certainly,
napalm killed more Japanese civilians than died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
combined.</P>
<P>Most of the Chichi Jima Flyboys fought and died during the worst killing
month in the history of all warfare?a thirty-day period in February and March of
1945 when the dying in WWII reached its climax. If you look at a graph charting
casualties over the four years of the Pacific war, you will see the line jump
dramatically beginning with the battle of Iwo Jima and the Flyboys' assaults
against mainland Japan. And few realize the U.S. killed more Japanese civilians
than Japanese soldiers and sailors. This was war at its most disturbing
intensity.</P>
<P>It was a time of obscene casualties, a time when grandparents burned to death
in cities aflame, and <EM>kamikaze</EM> sons swooped out of the sky to immolate
themselves against American ships. It was the time of the worst battle in the
history of the United States Marine Corps, the most decorated month in U.S.
history, a valorous and brutish time of all-out slaughter.</P>
<P>By February of 1945, logical, technocratic American military experts had
concluded that Japan was beaten. Yet the empire would not surrender. Americans
judged the Japanese to be "fanatic" in their willingness to fight with no hope
of victory. But Japan was not fighting a logical war. Japan, an island nation,
existed in its own moral universe, enclosed in a separate ethical biosphere.
Japanese leaders believed that "Japanese spirit" was the key to beating back the
barbarians at their door. They fought because they believed they could not
lose.</P>
<P>And while America cheered its flyers as its best and brightest, the Japanese
had a very different view of those who wreaked havoc from the skies. To them,
airmen who dropped napalm on defenseless civilians living in paper houses were
the nonhuman devils.</P><BR>
<P>This is a story of war, so it is a story of death. But it is not a story of
defeat. I have tracked down the eight Flyboys' brothers and sisters,
girlfriends, and aviator buddies who drilled and drank with them. Their
relatives and friends gave me photos, letters, and medals. I have scoured
yearbooks, logbooks, and little black books to find out who they were and what
they mean to us today. I read and reread six thousand pages of trial documents
and conducted hundreds of interviews in the U.S. and Japan.</P>
<P>The families and friends of the Flyboys could only tell me so much. Their
hometown buddies and relatives had stories of their youth and enlistment. Their
military comrades had remembrances from training camp up until they disappeared.
But none of them?not even the next of kin or the bunkmates who served in the
Pacific with them?knew exactly what happened to these eight on Chichi Jima. It
was all a dark hole, an unfathomable secret.</P>
<P>In Japan, some knew, but they had kept their silence. I met Japanese soldiers
who knew the Flyboys as prisoners. I heard stories about how they were treated,
about their interrogations, about how some of the Flyboys had lived among their
captors for weeks. I met soldiers who swapped jokes with them, who slept in the
same rooms.</P>
<P>And I ventured to Chichi Jima. Chichi Jima is part of an island chain due
south of Tokyo the Japanese call the Ogasawara Islands. On English maps the
chain is called the Bonin Islands. The name Bonin is a French cartographer's
corruption of the old Japanese word <EM>munin</EM>, which means "no man." These
islands were uninhabited for most of Japan's existence. They literally contained
"no peoples" or "no mans." So Bonin translates loosely into English as No Mans
Land.</P>
<P>I hacked through forest growth in No Mans Land to uncover the last days of
the Flyboys. I stood on cliffs with Japanese veterans who pointed to where they
saw the Flyboys parachute into the Pacific. I strode where Flyboys had walked. I
heard from eyewitnesses who told me much. Others revealed a great deal by
refusing to tell me anything.</P>
<P>Eventually, I understood the facts about what happened to Dick, Marve, Glenn,
Grady, Jimmy, Floyd, Warren Earl, and the Unknown Airman. I comprehended the
"what" of their fates.</P>
<P>But to determine the "why" of their story, I had to embark upon another
journey. A trip back in time, back 149 years, to another century. Back to when
the first American military men walked in No Mans Land.
