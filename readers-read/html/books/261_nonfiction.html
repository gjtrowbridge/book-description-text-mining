<b>Excerpt from Chapter 1</b>
<BR><BR>


		<P><B><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></B></P>

<br>
<P>I love listening to people's stories about where they were and what
they were doing on the morning of 9/11, especially the stories from
the ones who, through luck or fate, were allowed to live.</P>

<P>For instance, there's this guy who had just returned the day before
from his honeymoon. That night, on September 10, his new
bride thought she'd make him her special homemade burrito. The
burrito was horrible, like eating tar stripped off the center line of
the Major Deegan expressway. But love ignores all of that and what
counts is the gesture, not the digestion. He told her how grateful he
was and how much he loved her. And he asked for another.</P>

<P>The next morning, September 11, 2001, he's on the subway from
Brooklyn to his job on one of the top floors of the World Trade
Center. The subway might have been heading to Manhattan, but
the burrito was heading south, and I don't mean the Jersey shore.
He starts to get sick, real sick, and decides to get off just one stop
before the World Trade Center. He runs up the subway stairs in a
desperate search for facilities. But this is New York and that was
not to be. And thus, on the corner of Park Row and Broadway, he
became a poster boy for Depends.</P>

<P>Embarrassed and humiliated&#151;but feeling much better!&#151;he
flagged down a gypsy cab and offered him a hundred dollars to
take him home ($9 for the ride, and $91 toward the price of a
new car).</P>

<P>When the man got home, he ran inside to take a shower and to
put on a new set of clothes so he could get back to Manhattan.
Coming out of the shower he flipped on the TV and, as he stood
there, he watched the plane slam right into the floor where he
worked, where he would have been <EM>right now</EM> had his loving wife
not made him that wonderful&#151;that absolutely perfectly incredible
amazing. . . He broke down and began to cry.</P>

<P>My own 9/11 story wasn't so close a call. I was asleep in Santa
Monica. The phone rang around 6:30 a.m. and it was my mother-in-
law. "New York is under attack!" is what I heard her say
through my half-awake ear. I wanted to say, "Yeah so what's new-
and it's 6:30 in the morning!"</P>

<P>"New York is at war," she continued. This made no sense other
than, again, it always feels like war in New York. "Turn on the TV,"
she said. And so I did. I woke up my wife and as the television faded
on there were the towers, on fire. We tried to call our daughter back
home in New York, no luck, then tried to call our friend Joanne
(who works near the World Trade Center), no luck, and then we just
sat there stunned. We didn't leave the bed or the TV until five that
afternoon when we finally found out that our daughter and Joanne
were okay.</P>

<P>But a line producer we had just worked with, Bill Weems, was
not okay. As the networks started to run a scroll along the bottom
of the TV with the names of those who were on the planes, along
came Bill's name on that screen. My last memory of him was the
two of us horsing around at a funeral home where we were shooting
a piece about the tobacco industry. Put two guys with a dark
sense of humor around a bunch of undertakers and you've got
what we would call nirvana. Three months later he was dead
and&#151;how do they say it?&#151;"life as we knew it changed forever."</P>

<P>Really? Did it? How has it changed? Is there enough distance from
that tragic day to ask that question and find an intelligent answer?
Things certainly changed for Bill's wife and his seven-year-old daughter.
There's the crime, right there, to have her daddy taken from her
at such a young age. And life changed for the loved ones of the other
3,000 who were murdered. They will never lose the sorrow they feel.
They are told that they "must move on." Move on to where? Those
of us who have lost someone (and I guess that's eventually everyone)
know that while life does "move on," the sock in the gut, the sorrow
in the heart, will never leave, so ways must be found to embrace it
and make it work for you and the living.</P>

<P>Somehow we all work our way through our own personal losses
and we get up the next morning and the morning after that and fix
the kids' breakfast and do another load of laundry and pay the bills
and. . .</P>

<P>Meanwhile, in faraway Washington, D.C., life is changing, too.
Taking advantage of our grief, and our fear that "it" may happen
again, an appointed president uses the dead of 9/11 as a convenient
cover, a justification, for permanently altering our American way of
life. Is that why they died, so that George W. Bush can turn the
country into Texas? We've already conducted two wars since 9/11,
and an upcoming third or a fourth is not all that unlikely. If this is
allowed to continue, then all we will have accomplished is to dishonor
those 3,000-plus dead. I know Bill Weems didn't die so he
could be used as an excuse to bomb innocents overseas. If his
death, his life, is to have a greater meaning from this moment forward,
it is to make sure that no one else like him will have to lose
his or her life in this insane, violent world, a world we now seem
hell-bent on running any way we damn well please.</P>

<P>I'm lucky, I guess, that I even get to write these words you are reading. Not just because I get to live in the <EM>most wonderfulest country in the whole wide world!,</EM> but because after 9/11, my former publisher, Regan Books (a division of HarperCollins which is a division
of the News Corp which owns Fox News and it's all owned
by Rupert Murdoch), was trying its hardest to make sure my career
as an author would come to an early end.</P>

<P>The first 50,000 copies of <EM>Stupid White Men</EM> came off the printing press the day before 9/11, but when the tragedy struck the next
morning, the trucks that would carry them to the nation's bookstores
never left the loading dock. The publisher then held the
books hostage for five long months-not simply out of good taste
and respect (which I might have been able to understand), but out
of a desire to censor me and the things I wanted to say. They insisted
I rewrite up to 50 percent of the book and that I remove sections
that they found offensive to our leader, Mr. Bush.</P>

<P>I refused to change a word. A standoff ensued until a librarian in
New Jersey heard me talking about the phone call I had just received
from the Murdoch publisher telling me that it looked as if
they had no choice, thanks to my stubbornness, but to "pulp" and
recycle all 50,000 copies of my book that were gathering dust in a
warehouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I also was told by others not
to expect much in the way of a book career after this, as word
would spread that I was considered "trouble," a royal pain in the
ass who wouldn't play ball.</P>

<P>This librarian, Ann Sparanese, a woman I did not know, sent
out an e-mail to a list of librarians, telling them that my book was
being banned. Her letter shot around the Internet and, within
days, letters from angry librarians were flooding Regan Books. I
got a call from the Murdoch police.</P>

<P>"What did you tell the librarians?"
"Huh? I don't know any librarians."
"Yes you do! You told them about what we are doing with your
book and now . . . <EM>we're getting hate mail from librarians!"</EM>
"Hmm," I replied, "I guess that's one terrorist group you don't
want to mess with."</P>

<P>Fearing there would soon be a crazed mob of wild librarians
storming down Fifth Avenue and surrounding the HarperCollins
building, refusing to leave until either my book was liberated from
the Scranton warehouse or Murdoch himself was drawn and quartered
(though I would have settled for making Bill O'Reilly wear
his underwear on his head for a week), the News Corp surrendered.</P>

<P>They dumped my book in some bookstores with no advertising,
no reviews, and the offer of a three-city tour: Arlington!
Denver! Somewhere in New Jersey! In other words, the book was
sent to the gallows for a quick and painless death. It's too bad you
wouldn't listen to us, one Murdoch operative told me, we were
only trying to help you. The country is behind George W. Bush and
it is intellectually dishonest of you not to rewrite your book and
admit that he has done a good job since 9/11. You are out of touch
with the American people, and your book will now suffer as a result
of it.</P>

<P>I was so out of touch with my fellow Americans that, within
hours after the book's release, it went to number one on Amazon&#151;
and within five days it had gone to its ninth printing. It's in
its fifty-second printing as I write this.</P>

<P>The worst thing to tell a free people in a country that's still
mostly free is that they are not allowed to read something. That I
was able to be heard-and that my book would go on to be the
number-one selling nonfiction hardcover book of the year in the
United States-screams volumes about this great country. The
people will not be intimidated and they will not be bullied by those
in charge. The American people may look like they don't know
what's going on half the time, and they may spend too much time
picking out different-colored covers for their cell phones, but
when push comes to shove, they'll rise to the occasion and be there
for what is right.</P>

<P>So here I am now with this new book at none other than
AOLTIMEWARNER and Warner Books. I know, I know, when
will I learn my lesson? But here's the good news. During the entire
time I've been writing this book, AOL has been trying to <EM>get rid</EM>
<EM>of Warner Books.</EM> Why would a media company want to get rid
of its book division? What did Warner Books do to upset the gods
of AOL? I figure if AOL wants to dump these guys, they <EM>have</EM> to
be okay. Plus, the other Warner folks in this tangled web&#151;Warner
Bros. Pictures&#151;are the people who distributed my first film,
<EM>Roger & Me.</EM> They were good and decent and they never threatened
to "pulp it."</P>

<P>Okay, I'm rationalizing. Six media companies own everything.
Break up these monopolies for the good of the country! The free
flow of news and information in a democracy must not be in the
hands of just a few rich men.</P>

<P>Yet, I have to say, they seem to be behind me here 100 percent.
1000 percent!! Not once have they said I was "trouble."
But then, it's not me they really need to worry about.
It's the librarians.
And you.</P>
