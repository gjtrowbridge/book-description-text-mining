<div><B>Chapter Excerpt</B></div><BR><p>Wonderfully, it was the boy who saw him first. He glanced out of his bedroom window, then looked again and harder -- and dared to hope. No, it was not a trick of the light; a tall figure in a ragged black coat and a ruined old hat was walking down the darkening hillside; and he was heading toward the house.</p>

<p>The stranger's face was chalk-white with exhaustion, and he
stumbled on the rough ground, his hands held out before him like
a sleepwalker's. He looked like a scarecrow deserting his post. High
grasses soaked his cracked boots and drenched his coat hems. A
mist like a silver veil floated above the ground, broke at his knees,
and reassembled itself in his wake. In this twilight fog, mysterious
shapes appeared and dematerialized, so that the pale walker was
never sure he had seen merely the branches of trees or the arms of
mythic dancers come to greet him. Closer in, the dark shadows of
the tree trunks twisted into harsh and threatening faces.</p>

<p>Across the fields he saw the yellow glow of lamplight in the window
of a house, and he raised his eyes to the sky in some kind of
thanks. With no fog on high, the early stars glinted like grains of
salt. He became aware of cattle nearby, not yet taken indoors in this
mild winter. Many lay curled on the grass where they chewed the
cud. As he passed, one or two lurched to their feet in alarm and
lumbered off.</p>

<p>And in the house ahead, the boy, nine years old and blond as
hay, raced downstairs, calling wildly to his father.</p>


<p><br />The stranger's bones hurt, and his lungs ached almost beyond
endurance. Hunger intensified his troubles; he'd eaten one meal in
three days. The calm light in the window ahead pulled him forward in hope. If he held their attention, he might get bed and board for
a week -- and maybe more. In the days of the High King at Tara, a
storyteller stayed seven days and seven nights. Did they know that?
Nobody knew anything anymore.</p>

<p>With luck, though, the child in this house would help. Children
want stories, and the parents might stretch their hospitality, fired
by the delight in the boy's eyes. Unlike last night's billet; high up on
a hill farm, he had slept in a loft above the cows, where the east
wind got at his bones. The ignorant people there, who had no use
for stories, gave him no food and closed their fireside to him. It happened
more and more.</p>

<p>But this house would surely prove better; and it was, after all,
Halloween, the great time of the year for telling stories, the time of
All Souls', when the dead had permission to rise from their graves
and prowl the land.</p>

<p>Over the last few hundred yards the fog dispersed into flitters and
wisps. At the house, a small white gate opened from the lane into a
country garden, which in summer would shine with bunched roses
and morning glories and tresses of sweet pea. The tall man in the
black coat rapped twice on a brass knocker. Immediately, the husband
of the house opened the door.</p>

<p>"Aha!"</p>

<p>The stranger and the householder exchanged a solid handshake,
eye to eye. Behind his father, the boy waited in the hallway, jigging
from foot to foot.</p>

<p>"God save all here," said the stranger; he hunched his shoulders
nervously.</p>

<p>Over the years, his voice had grown deep and rotund. His manner
and speech had an unusual formality, with trace elements of
stately English from an earlier century and a hint of classical learning.
Consequently, his language rang generally more colorful than
the speech of the people he met every day.</p>

<p>The man of the house smiled and stood aside.</p>

<p>"Come in. You brought clear skies to us."</p>

<p>"With your permission, I'll bring clear thoughts too."</p>

<p>"Your coat is wet -- let me take it."</p>

<p>The man extended a cold, bony hand to the boy peeking around
his father's waist.</p>

<p>"A fine boy. God save you too, ma'am!" called the Storyteller to
the woman of the house.</p>

<p>She looked irked, and he guessed that he, this stringy, unwashed
man, with skin like canvas, would disrupt her rigorous household;
nonetheless she set a place for him while her husband, pleased and
comfortable, poured the visitor a drink.</p>


<p><br />The boy watched the stranger attacking the food like a tired hound.
He sensed that the man's hunger fought with the man's decorum.
Nobody spoke because the newcomer seemed too famished to be
interrupted. The boy examined the man's face, saw the long, thin
scar, wondered if he had been in a knife fight, perhaps with a sailor
on some foreign quayside.</p>

<p>And the sodden boots -- in his mind he saw the stranger fording
streams, climbing out of gullies, traversing slopes of limestone shale
on his endless travels across the country. Did he have a dog? Seemingly
not, which was a pity, since a dog could have sat guard by the
fire at night. Did the man ever sleep in caves? They said that bears
and wolves had long been extinct in Ireland -- but had they?</p>

<p>That evening, in that white house among the fields, a boy's most
passionate dream came true. His father had long talked of the traveling
storytellers. He said they possessed brilliant powers; they
brought the long-gone past to life vividly, without what he called
"the interference of scholars. Those professors," he said. "They dry
out history in order to put it down on paper." In his father's view, a
tale with the feeling taken out of it had "no blood and was worth
very little."</p>

<p>But the old stories, told by traveling storytellers round the fireside
on winter evenings -- they came hurtling straight down the
long, shiny pipeline of the centuries, and the characters, all love
and hate and fire, "tumbled out on our own stone floor."
