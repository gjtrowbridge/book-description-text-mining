<p align="center"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p align="center">&quot;Delta, Delta, Delta, Can We Help Ya, Help Ya, Help Ya?&quot;<br>
(or, So Do They Really Have Topless Pillow Fights?)</p>
<p>Because I've never been a member of any girl-only group other than sports
teams, I didn't know much about sororities when I started researching this book.
Actually, I was slightly afraid of them. We outsiders, who can only envision
what goes on behind sorority house walls and inside sorority girls' heads,
merely have movies such as <i>Revenge of the Nerds, Animal House</i>, and <i>
Legally Blonde</i> to inform our views about sororities. Those of us with the
more salacious of imaginations -- or the more B-movie of tastes -- might
associate with sororities the topless pillow fights that must inevitably occur
when fifty estrogen-laden creatures gather for a sleepover (or so men everywhere
fervently pray). Or perhaps a Heathers-inspired coldness might come to mind as
we visualize the vicious hair-tearing, earring-twisting catfights between
sororities clamoring for the most popular fraternity to escort them to
Homecoming. Or our image of sororities (as was mine) is the tamer, more
relatable version: the popular group of girls from high school -- cooler,
prettier, wealthier, multiplied by ten, living under one roof, and recognized
officially by their college as a clique.</p>
<p>I don't think I realized the extent to which I was an outsider, however,
until I found myself smack in a bustling epicenter of sorority life -- a &quot;Greek
boutique&quot; at a conference for sorority and fraternity representatives. The room
was swathed in the hyperprecise sorority colors: not blue and yellow but &quot;Old
Blue&quot; and &quot;Caf� Au Lait&quot; (Sigma Delta Tau); not green and white but &quot;Olive
Green&quot; and &quot;Pearl White&quot; (Kappa Delta). I was surrounded by sorority letters,
colors, and symbols stamped on, drawn on, embossed on, engraved in, carved into,
or welded onto such a variety of objects that it felt as if I had arrived in a
Disney gift shop for &quot;Sororityland.&quot; As I watched sorority sisters in
expensive-looking clothes try on kitschy jewelry they likely wouldn't deign to
wear if it didn't bear their sorority letters, I wondered what possessed them to
feel such passion for objects I obviously didn't understand. Here, on table upon
table of items divided neatly by individual sororities and their corresponding
colors (sororities also have certain mascots, symbols, jewels, and flowers, such
as Delta Phi Epsilon's &quot;Lovely Purple Iris&quot;), the sisters had their pick of
sorority emery boards, money pouches, picture frames, bottle openers, and
refrigerator magnets. Lips feeling dry? Try the boutique's &quot;Sorority Lip Balm!&quot;
Bathroom not smelling sparkly clean? Here's a sorority air freshener! Crave a
more elegant hygienic experience? How about sorority bath crystals? Gesundheit!
Have a sorority tissue.</p>
<p>In the long line at the cash register, sorority girls fussed and &quot;fabulous!&quot;ed
over the souvenirs, twittering in italics about such foreign jargon as rush
crushes, cold dorms, and prefs. I was officially entering Sorority World, a
world of High Priestesses, Temples, and secret handshakes, a world so entirely
different from my non-Greek experience that it had a name for people like me,
people unaffiliated and unlettered. &quot;Oh . . . ,&quot; one girl drawled in a honeyed
southern accent &quot;You're a GDI.&quot; A GDI? &quot;A God-Damn Independent.&quot; Oh.</p>
<p>Clearly, this wasn't going to be your everyday reporting assignment. In order
to understand this world so fully that I could portray it fairly and accurately,
I realized I needed to have so engulfing an experience that I would be living,
breathing, and shopping sorority. My first plan was to try to follow a sorority
throughout the 2002�2003 academic year, to become such an ever-present fixture
in the house that I would be treated as something like an honorary member. I
canvassed several campuses in search of an appropriate group to shadow: a
national group, affiliated with a &quot;historically white&quot; national sorority
organization -- white and black sororities are still largely segregated. (The
sororities illustrated in this book are &quot;historically white&quot; unless otherwise
noted.) Finally, a sister invited me to observe her group, a popular sorority at
a school whose Greek system had been under fire in recent years because of
several hazing-related deaths. </p>
<p>The day I was to visit the house, I agonized over my outfit, blow-dried my
hair straight, put on more makeup than usual, and dug my spikiest ankle boots
out of the recesses of my closet. Admittedly, because not many of my friends
were sorority sisters, I was nervous about entering an entire house full of
them. The more I learned about sororities, the more bizarre their world seemed.
As I tottered up to the porch, I suddenly didn't feel like a twenty-six-year-old
investigative reporter preparing to dig into another project about secret group
behavior. I felt like the kid I was in junior high school, wearing sweatpants
and soccer sandals, hoping to please everyone but at the same time trying hard
to pretend not to care.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, I was curled up on a bunk bed and chatting with two of
the sorority girls. Sometime during the emotional story one sister shared about
how a sorority rivalry destroyed her relationship with her longtime best friend,
I flashed back to my camp counselor days and had visions of serving as a kind of
resident big sister to these girls. It hit me then that when I attended
overnight camp, my teenaged bunk acted in ways that were somewhat similar to
sororities. We traveled in packs, had rivalries with other bunks, pressured each
other to break rules, and even fought over the same guy (who, coincidentally,
eventually became the president of his fraternity at the school where I now
sat). Here at the sorority house was a group that similarly provided selected
college girls an automatic sense of belonging, no talent or niche required -- a
built-in social network to accompany a girl to bars, parties, sporting events,
and study sessions. This comparison caused me not only to wonder if sorority
girls were so different from the rest of us, but also to think that had I
attended a larger college, maybe I would have been a sorority girl, too. But
when the girls gave me a tour of the house, they told me about their sisters'
diet pill addiction, their pride in the fact that they hazed new girls, and
their &quot;drug room,&quot; which displayed a bong, several bottles of pills, and some
suspicious-looking white powder (some of the girls regularly did cocaine). If I
had joined a sorority, I asked myself, would I, like the girls I met, inevitably
have fallen into the kind of herd mentality among sororities that can encourage
conformity, cliquishness, and compromising morals? At that initial point in my
research, I didn't know.</p>
<p>After several days of observing this major national sorority, I was
approached by the adviser of the house. A stern, heavyset sorority alumna who
looked much older than her twentysomething years, she led me into the
&quot;scholarship room&quot; -- a small room with computers and a large file cabinet full
of notes, tests, and papers from various classes offered at the school. She told
me to sit down, and locked the glass door. Girls peered in quizzically as they
walked by, but a quick glare from the adviser sent them scurrying on.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't have been given permission to be here,&quot; she said gruffly. She
interrupted herself by cursing under her breath and yelling in her deep voice at
the girls she could see through a window who were smoking cigarettes on the
front porch. &quot;You're not allowed to smoke in front of the house! It doesn't look
good!&quot; The girls reluctantly slinked away.</p>
<p>The adviser turned back to me. &quot;You need to get permission from the national
office, which is probably not going to give it to you.&quot; She paused again. &quot;And
if for some reason they do, I simply cannot allow you to write about the drugs.&quot;</p>
<p>When I got home, I called the sorority's national office and explained what I
was doing, figuring this process of obtaining official permission was just a
formality. The executive director, however, said otherwise. MTV had just aired a
show called <i>Sorority Life</i>, which followed the six-week pledge process of
a California sorority (a &quot;local&quot; sorority, which meant it was independent and
unaffiliated with any national organization). The show had infuriated sororities
nationwide, who believed that MTV had overly sensationalized life in a sorority
house and concentrated only on the girls' drinking and catty fights. &quot;Because of
the MTV show,&quot; the executive director told me, &quot;all of the national sororities
have decided on a blanket policy not to cooperate with any members of the media.
It's just not appropriate at this time.&quot; With that, I was suddenly completely
closed off from a group of several dozen sorority girls I had already started to
like.</p>
<p>Realizing that I wouldn't be able to openly observe a sorority house unless I
received permission from its national office, I called other national sorority
headquarters to state my case. One by one, every national office I talked to
shut me out of their houses, even as I told them I was presenting a truthful --
not necessarily negative -- account of what sorority life is really like. &quot;We're
gun-shy,&quot; said one. &quot;We've gotten several media calls even this week and we're
turning them all down,&quot; said another. The twenty-six member groups of the
National Panhellenic Conference, which was established in 1902 to oversee the
historically white national sororities, had laid down the law.</p>
<p>I didn't understand the panicked responses of the national offices, which
claim to instill within their sororities &quot;individuality, . . . togetherness, . .
. [and] friendships,&quot; according to the web site for Alpha Epsilon Phi, whose
motto is &quot;Many Hearts, One Purpose.&quot; They promote goals such as Delta Delta
Delta's, to &quot;develop a stronger and more womanly character, to broaden the moral
and intellectual life, and to assist its members in every possible way.&quot; They
foster, like Kappa Kappa Gamma, &quot;friendship rooted in a tradition of high
standards.&quot; These aspirations seemed laudable, these institutions beneficial.
One would assume the real-life sororities, therefore, have so much to offer that
their positives would far outweigh their negatives. But when one school's
Panhellenic adviser attempted to blacklist me on her campus for writing this
book, she insisted she must &quot;protect our women.&quot; The question was, protect them
from what?</p>
<p>Because no sorority would knowingly let me tail its sisters for the year, it
became necessary for me to fly under the radar of both the national offices and
the sorority girls themselves. I sought out individual sisters who were willing
to risk their sorority membership by letting me into their lives for an entire
academic year, knowing that they could not tell anyone -- their sorority
sisters, their friends, their families -- who I really was. I can't divulge how
the four girls I chose, who knew they would be the main characters in a book I
was writing about sororities, introduced me to their sisters, who did not know;
and I can't disclose the disguise I wore or role I played when spending time
with these groups (suffice it to say, I can pass for nineteen). To further
protect the four girls, who could be ostracized and even thrown out of the Greek
system if their identities were revealed, I have given pseudonyms to them, their
school, and their school's Greek groups, and have changed identifying details.
But their dilemmas, emotions, interactions, and dialogues are real. (The girls
didn't know I also monitored their Instant Messenger away messages, which they
changed sometimes as frequently as once an hour. Away messages are bulletins
that IM users post online so that friends can see what they are up to. Like many
college students, the girls used their away messages to convey their state of
mind or broadcast their whereabouts.)</p>
<p>In order to provide a balanced view of sororities, I selected good-hearted
girls who were members of &quot;normal&quot; sororities not known on campus as extreme
stereotypes. I also chose these girls on the basis of their diverse attitudes
toward and roles in their sororities. These sisters, one of whom was a sorority
officer, are largely the kind of girls whom the national offices would be proud
to have represent them, had the national offices been willing to allow
themselves to be represented. The two juniors and two sophomores all attend a
school I'll call State University, a campus on which Greek life is considered
important but not essential.</p>
<p>It turned out that &quot;going undercover&quot; gave me more candid access to the
sororities than I would have had openly as a reporter. Because I played the role
I did, the sisters didn't know to censor their behavior in front of me, and my
four main subjects tended to view me more as a friend than a journalist. With
that said, however, I would not presume that the experiences of these four
sisters alone could accurately represent a sorority system of millions. Many of
the posts on Greek system message boards constantly remind readers that it's not
right to let a few renegade sisters, or even chapters, represent the image of
the entire sorority system. I took this message to heart. My four girls aren't
renegades; nevertheless, I have supplemented my observations of them with visits
and interviews with scores of other sorority girls. By the time I finished
writing <i>Pledged</i>, I had spoken with or met with several hundred girls.
Essentially, I got to return to college and experience the path I had not taken
the first time around (and had a far better time than I did when I was actually
enrolled in college). When a sorority girl needed a date to a Date Party, I
went; when sisters went shopping together, I joined them; when new members
danced exuberantly on Bid Day, so did I. Though I couldn't incorporate all of
the hundreds of interviews in this book, the sisters' frank assessments of
sorority life shaped my observations.</p>
<p>In writing this book, the surprise for me -- and this may delight many
readers -- was that the notions of those topless pillow fights may not have been
so far off base after all. In the back of my mind, I don't think I ever really
believed that sororities were quite as campy as their conventional image. But at
about the time I heard about traditions like &quot;Naked Party&quot; and &quot;Boob Ranking,&quot; I
had to reconsider. I learned that many of the rumors (as well as the fantasies)
about sororities are indeed staggeringly true, including those concerning
loyalty, sex, conformity, drugs, violence, verbal abuse, mind games,
prostitution, racism, forced binge drinking, nudity, cheating, eating disorders,
rituals, &quot;mean girls,&quot; and secrecy. But not all sororities encompass these
experiences; and of the sororities that do, not all consist of girls one would
necessarily consider &quot;bad.&quot;</p>
<p>Much of sorority life espouses noble purpose, and the friendships and
philanthropy encouraged by these organizations can enhance a girl's college
experience, boost her self-esteem, and better her character. But the prevalence
of the aforementioned litany, which still occurs on several campuses nationwide
in the name of tradition, speaks volumes about larger issues concerning women,
higher education, and female group dynamics. Even halfway into the year, I was
plagued by questions. Why are twenty-first-century women still so eager to
participate in such seemingly outdated, ritualistic groups and activities? What
is the purpose of sororities and what does membership truly require of the
sisters? How does a sisterhood change the way a girl thinks about herself? Do
sororities cause women to fall further behind in the gender wars or are they
instead women's secret weapon? My challenge, then, in writing Pledged, was how
to reconcile the unexpected discovery of a dark side to sorority life with the
observation that many of the girls who participate in it and continue to join it
in droves are &quot;normal&quot; girls, girls who are sweet, smart, successful, and kind
both before and after they join. Girls -- and this puzzled me -- who by year's
end no longer intimidated me. Girls who would be surprised to read how their
sororities appear from an outsider's point of view.
