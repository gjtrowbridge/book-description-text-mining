<BR>
<P><DIV align="center"><B>The Road to Hell Is<BR>
Paved with Leeks and Potatoes</B></DIV></P>

<BR>
<P>As far as I know, the only evidence supporting the theory
that Julia Child first made Potage Parmentier during a
bad bout of ennui is her own recipe for it. She writes that Potage
Parmentier- which is just a Frenchie way of saying potato
soup - "smells good, tastes good, and is simplicity itself to
make." It is the first recipe in the first book she ever wrote. She
concedes that you can add carrots or broccoli or green beans if
you want, but that seems beside the point, if what you're looking
for is simplicity itself.</P>

<P>Simplicity itself. It sounds like poetry, doesn't it? It sounds like
just what the doctor ordered.</P>

<P>It wasn't what my doctor ordered, though. My doctor-my
gynecologist, to be specific- ordered a baby.</P>

<P>"There are the hormonal issues in your case, with the PCOS,
you know about that already. And you are pushing thirty, after all.
Look at it this way - there will never be a better time."
This was not the first time I'd heard this. It had been happening
for a couple of years now, ever since I'd sold some of my eggs
for $7,500 in order to pay off credit card debt. Actually, that was
the second time I'd "donated"- a funny way of putting it, since
when you wake up from the anesthesia less a few dozen ova and
get dressed, there's a check for thousands of dollars with your
name on it waiting at the receptionist's desk. The first time was
five years ago, when I was twenty-four, impecunious and fancyfree.
I hadn't planned on doing it twice, but three years later I got
a call from a doctor with an unidentifiable European accent who
asked me if I'd be interested in flying down to Florida for a second
go-round, because "our clients were very satisfied with the
results of your initial donation." Egg donation is still a newenough
technology that our slowly evolving legal and etiquette
systems have not yet quite caught up; nobody knows if egg donators
are going to be getting sued for child support ten years down
the line or what. So discussions on the subject tend to be knotted
with imprecise pronouns and euphemisms. The upshot of this
phone call, though, was that there was a little me running around
Tampa or somewhere, and the little me's parents were happy
enough with him or her that they wanted a matched set. The
honest part of me wanted to shout, "Wait, no - when they start
hitting puberty you'll regret this!" But $7,500 is a lot of money.</P>

<P>Anyway, it was not until the second harvesting (they actually
call it "harvesting"; fertility clinics, it turns out, use a lot of
vaguely apocalyptic terms) that I found out I had polycystic ovarian
syndrome, which sounds absolutely terrifying, but apparently
just meant that I was going to get hairy and fat and I'd have to
take all kinds of drugs to conceive. Which means, I guess, that I
haven't heard my last of crypto-religious obstetric jargon.</P>

<P>So. Ever since I was diagnosed with this PCOS, two years ago,
doctors have been obsessing over my childbearing prospects. I've
even been given the Pushing Thirty speech by my avuncular,
white-haired <EM>orthopedist</EM> (what kind of twenty-nine-year-old has a
herniated disk, I ask you?).</P>

<P>At least my gynecologist had some kind of business in my private parts. Maybe that's why I heroically did not start bawling immediately
when he said this, as he was wiping off his speculum.
Once he left, however, I did fling one of my navy faille pumps at
the place where his head had been just a moment before. The
heel hit the door with a thud, leaving a black scuff mark, then
dropped onto the counter, where it knocked over a glass jar of
cotton swabs. I scooped up all the Q-tips from the counter and
the floor and started to stuff them back into the jar before realizing
I'd probably gotten them all contaminated, so then I shoved
them into a pile next to an apothecary jar full of fresh needles
and squeezed myself back into the vintage forties suit I'd been so
proud of that morning when Nate from work told me it made
my waist look small while subtly eyeing my cleavage, but which
on the ride from lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side on an
un-air-conditioned 6 train had gotten sweatstained and rumpled.
Then I slunk out of the room, fifteen-buck co-pay already in
hand, the better to make my escape before anyone discovered I'd
trashed the place.</P>

<P>As soon as I got belowground, I knew there was a problem.
Even before I reached the turnstiles, I heard a low, subterranean
rumble echoing off the tiled walls, and noticed more than the
usual number of aimless-looking people milling about. A tangy
whiff of disgruntlement wafted on the fetid air. Every once in a
great while the "announcement system" would come on and "announce"
something, but none of these spatterings of word salad
resulted in the arrival of a train, not for a long, long time. Along
with everyone else, I leaned out over the platform edge, hoping to
see the pale yellow of a train's headlight glinting off the track, but
the tunnel was black. I smelled like a rained-upon, nervous sheep.
My feet, in their navy heels with the bows on the toe, were killing
me, as was my back, and the platform was so crammed with
people that before long I began to worry someone was going to
fall off the edge onto the tracks-possibly me, or maybe the person
I was going to push during my imminent psychotic break.</P>


<P>But then, magically, the crowd veered away. For a split second
I thought the stink coming off my suit had reached a deadly new
level, but the wary, amused looks on the faces of those edging
away weren't focused on me. I followed their gaze to a plug of a
woman, her head of salt-and-pepper hair shorn into the sort of
crew cut they give to the mentally disabled, who had plopped
down on the concrete directly behind me. I could see the whorls
of her cowlick like a fingerprint, feel the tingle of invaded personal
space against my shins. The woman was muttering to herself
fiercely. Commuters had vacated a swath of platform all
around the loon as instinctually as a herd of wildebeests evading
a lioness. I was the only one stuck in the dangerous blank circle,
the lost calf, the old worn-out cripple who couldn't keep up.</P>

<P>The loon started smacking her forehead with the heel of her
palm. "Fuck!" she yelled. "Fuck! FUCK!"</P>

<P>I couldn't decide whether it would be safer to edge back into
the crowd or freeze where I was. My breathing grew shallow as I
turned my eyes blankly out across the tracks to the uptown platform,
that old subway chameleon trick.</P>

<P>The loon placed both palms down on the concrete in front of
her and- CRACK! - smacked her forehead hard on the
ground.</P>

<P>This was a little much even for the surrounding crowd of New
Yorkers, who of course all knew that loons and subways go together
like peanut butter and chocolate. The sickening noise of
skull on concrete seemed to echo in the damp air- as if she was
using her specially evolved resonant brainpan as an instrument to
call the crazies out from every far-underground branch of the
city. Everybody flinched, glancing around nervously. With a
squeak I hopped back into the multitude. The loon had a smudgy
black abrasion right in the middle of her forehead, like the scuff
mark my shoe had left on my gynecologist's door, but she just
kept screeching. The train pulled in, and I connived to wiggle
into the car the loon wasn't going into.</P>


<P>It was only once I was in the car, squeezed in shoulder to shoulder,
the lot of us hanging by one hand from the overhead bar like
slaughtered cows on the trundling train, that it came to me- as
if some omnipotent God of City Dwellers were whispering the
truth in my ear-that the only two reasons I hadn't joined right in
with the loon with the gray crew cut, beating my head and screaming
"Fuck!" in primal syncopation, were (1) I'd be embarrassed
and (2) I didn't want to get my cute vintage suit any dirtier than
it already was. Performance anxiety and a dry-cleaning bill; those
were the only things keeping me from stark raving lunacy.</P>

<P>That's when I started to cry. When a tear dropped onto the
pages of the <EM>New York Post</EM> that the guy sitting beneath me was
reading, he just blew air noisily through his nose and turned to
the sports pages.</P>

<P>When I got off the subway, after what seemed like years, I
called Eric from a pay phone at the corner of Bay Ridge and
Fourth Avenue.</P>

<P>"Hey. Did you get anything for dinner?"
Eric made that little sucking-in-through-his-teeth sound he always
makes when he thinks he's about to get in trouble. "Was I
supposed to?"</P>

<P>"Well, I told you I'd be late because of my doctor's appointment-"
"Right, right, sorry. I just, I didn't . . . You want me to order
something in, or-"</P>

<P>"Don't worry about it. I'll pick up something or other."
"But I'm going to start packing just as soon as the NewsHour's
done, promise!"</P>

<P>It was nearly eight o'clock, and the only market open in Bay
Ridge was the Korean deli on the corner of Seventieth and Third.
I must have looked a sight, standing around in the produce aisle
in my bedraggled suit, my face tracked with mascara, staring like
a catatonic. I couldn't think of a thing that I wanted to eat. I
grabbed some potatoes, a bunch of leeks, some Hotel Bar butter.</P>

<P>I felt dazed and somehow will-less, as if I was following a shopping
list someone else had made. I paid, walked out of the shop,
and headed for the bus stop, but just missed the B69. There
wouldn't be another for a half hour at least, at this time of night,
so I started the ten-block walk home, carrying a plastic bag bristling
with spiky dark leek bouquets.</P>
<P>It wasn't until almost fifteen minutes  later, as I was walking
past the Catholic boys' school on Shore Road one block over
from our apartment building, that I realized that I'd managed,
unconsciously, to buy exactly the ingredients for Julia Child's
Potage Parmentier.</P>

<br>

<P>When I was a kid, my dad used to love to tell the story about finding
five-year-old Julie curled up in the back of his copper-colored
Datsun ZX immersed in a crumpled back issue of the <EM>Atlantic
Monthly.</EM> He told that one to all the guys at his office, and to the
friends he and my mom went out to dinner with, and to all of
the family who weren't born again and likely to disapprove. (Of
the <EM>Atlantic,</EM> not Z-cars.)</P>

<P>I think the point behind this was that I'd been singled out as an
early entrant to the ranks of the intellectually superior. And since
I was awful at ballet and tap dancing, after all, always the last one
to make it up the rope in gym class, a girl neither waifish nor
charming in owlish red-rimmed glasses, I took my ego-petting
where I could get it. But the not-very-highbrow truth of the matter
was that the reading was how I got my ya-yas out.</P>

<P>For the sake of my bookish reputation I upgraded to Tolstoy
and Steinbeck before I understood them, but my dark secret was
that really, I preferred the junk. <EM>The Dragonriders of Pern, Flowers
in the Attic, The Clan of the Cave Bear.</EM> This stuff was like my stash
of Playboys under the mattress. I waited until my camp counselor
left the cabin to steal the V. C. Andrews she stashed behind her
box of Tampax. I nicked my mom's Jean Auel, and had already
gotten halfway through before she found out, so she could only
wince and suppose there was some educational value, but no <EM>Valley
of Horses</EM> for you, young lady.</P>

<P>Then adolescence set in well and proper, and reading for kicks
got shoved in the backseat with the old <EM>Atlantics.</EM> It had been a
long time since I'd done anything with the delicious, licentious
cluelessness that I used to read those books - hell, sex now
wasn't as exciting as reading about sex used to be. I guess nowadays
your average fourteen-year-old Texan possesses exhaustive
knowledge of the sexual uses of tongue studs, but I doubt the information
excites her any more than my revelations about Neanderthal
sex.</P>

<P>You know what a fourteen-year-old Texan doesn't know shit
about? French food.</P>

<P>A couple of weeks after my twenty-ninth birthday, in the
spring of 2002, I went back to Texas to visit my parents. Actually,
Eric kind of made me go.</P>

<P>"You have to get out of here," he said. The kitchen drawer that
broke two weeks after we moved in, and was never satisfactorily
rehabilitated, had just careened off its tracks yet again, flinging
Pottery Barn silverware in all directions. I was sobbing, forks and
knives glittering at my feet. Eric was holding me in one of those
tight hugs like a half nelson, which he does whenever he's trying
to comfort me when what he really wants to do is smack me.</P>

<P>"Will you come with me?" I didn't look up from the snot stain
I was impressing upon his shirt.</P>

<P>"I'm too busy at the office right now. Besides, I think it's better
if you go by yourself. Hang out with your mom. Buy some
clothes. Sleep in."</P>

<P>"I have work, though."
"Julie, you're a temp. What's temping for if you can't run off
and take a break sometimes? That's why you're doing it, right?"
I didn't like to think about why I was temping. My voice went
high and cracked. "Well, I can't afford it."</P>


<P>"We can afford it. Or we can ask your parents to pay." He
grabbed my chin and lifted it up to his face. "Julie. Seriously? Go.
Because I can't live with you like this anymore."
So I went - my mom bought me the ticket for a late birthday
present. A week later I flew into Austin, early enough to grab
lunch at Poke-Jo's.</P>

<P>And then, right in the middle of my brisket sandwich and
okra, less than a month after I turned twenty-nine, Mom dropped
the Pushing Thirty bomb for the very first time.</P>

<P>"Jesus, Mom!"
"What?" My mother has this bright, smiling, hard tone that
she always uses when she wants me to face facts. She was using it
now. "All I'm saying is here you are, miserable, running away
from New York, getting into a bad place with Eric, and for what?
You're getting older, you're not taking advantage of the city, why
do this to yourself?"</P>

<P>This was exactly the one thing I had come to Austin to not talk
about. I should have known my mother would dig in like a goddamned
rat terrier.</P>

<P>I had gone to New York like everybody else goes to New
York - just as the essential first step for a potato destined for
soup is to have its skin peeled off, the essential starting point for
an aspiring actor is to move to New York. I preferred jobs that did
not require auditions, which, since I neither looked like Ren&#233;e
Zellweger nor was a terribly good actor, proved to be a problem.
Mostly what I'd done was temp, for (to name a few): the photocopier
contractor for the UN; the Asian American businesses underwriting
department at AIG; the vice president of a broadband
technology outfit with an amazing office looking out onto the
Brooklyn Bridge, which folded about two weeks after I got there;
and an investment firm specializing in the money matters of nunneries.
Recently, I'd started work at a government agency downtown.</P>

<P>It looked like they were going to offer to bring me on
permanently - eventually all the temp employers offered to let
you go perm - and for the first time, I was considering, in a despairing
sort of way, doing it. It was enough to make me suicidal
even before my mom started telling me I was getting old. Mom
should have known this, but instead of apologizing for her cruelty
she just popped another piece of fried okra into her mouth
and said, "Let's go shopping- your clothes are just awful!"</P>

<P>The next morning I lingered at my parents' kitchen table long
after they'd both left for work, wrapped up in a well-worn gray
flannel robe I'd forgotten I had, sipping coffee. I'd finished the
Times crossword and all the sections except for Business and Circuits,
but didn't yet have enough caffeine in my system to contemplate
getting dressed. (I'd overindulged in margaritas the
night before, not at all an unusual occurrence when visiting the
folks in Austin.) The pantry door stood ajar, and my aimless gaze
rested on the bookshelves inside, the familiar ranks of spines
lined up there. When I got up to fill my cup one last time, I made
a detour and took one of the books - <EM>Mastering the Art of French
Cooking, Vol. 1,</EM> my mom's old 1967 edition, a book that had known
my family's kitchen longer than I had. I sat back down at the
table at which I'd eaten a thousand childhood afternoon snacks
and began flipping through, just for the hell of it.</P>

<P>When I was a kid, I used to look at <EM>MtAoFC</EM> quite a lot. Partly
it was just my obsession with anything between two covers, but
there was something else, too. Because this book has the power
to shock. <EM>MtAoFC</EM> is still capable of striking deep if obscure zones
of discomfort. Find the most pale, pierced and kohl-eyed, proudly
pervy hipster you can and ask her to cook P&#226;t&#233; de Canard en
Cro?te, aided only by the helpful illustrations on pages 571 through
575. I promise you, she'll be fleeing back to Williamsburg, where
no one's going to make her bone a whole duck, faster than you
can say, "trucker hats are soooo five minutes ago."</P>

<P>But why? What is it about this book? It's just an old cookbook,
for God's sake. Yet vegetarians, Atkinsers, and South Beach
bums flare their nostrils at the stink of apostasy between its
covers. Self-proclaimed foodies spare a smile of fond condescension
before returning to their Chez Panisse cookbooks. By all
rights, I should feel this way too. I am, after all, that ultimate synthesis
of urban flakiness and suburban self-righteousness, the
New York actress.</P>

<P>Well, actually, I guess I can't say that, since I've never had a real
acting job. And to tell the truth - it's time I faced facts here- I
never really even tried. But if I'm not a New York actress, what
am I? I'm a person who takes a subway from the outer boroughs
to a lower Manhattan office every morning, who spends her days
answering phones and doing copying, who is too disconsolate
when she gets back to her apartment at night to do anything but
sit on the couch and stare vacantly at reality TV shows until she
falls asleep.</P>

<P>Oh God. It really was true, wasn't it? I really was a secretary.
When I looked up from <EM>MtAoFC</EM> for the first time, half an hour
after I opened it, I realized that deep down, I'd been resigned to
being a secretary for months - maybe even years.</P>

<P>That was the bad news. The good news was that the buzzing
in my head and queasy but somehow exhilarating squeeze deep
in my belly were reminding me that I might still, after all, be
something else.</P>

<P>Do you know <EM>Mastering the Art of French Cooking?</EM> You must, at
least, know of it - it's a cultural landmark, for Pete's sake. Even
if you just think of it as the book by that lady who looks like Dan
Aykroyd and bleeds a lot, you know of it. But do you know the
book itself ? Try to get your hands on one of the early hardback
editions- they're not exactly rare. For a while there, every
American housewife who could boil water had a copy, or so I've
heard.</P>

<P>It's not lushly illustrated; there are no shiny soft-core images of
the glossy-haired author sinking her teeth into a juicy strawberry
or smiling stonily before a perfectly rustic tart with carving knife
in hand, like some chilly blonde kitchen dominatrix. The dishes
are hopelessly dated - the cooking times outrageously long, the
use of butter and cream beyond the pale, and not a single reference
to pancetta or sea salt or wasabi. This book hasn't been on
the must-have list for enterprising gourmands in decades. But as
I held it in my hands that morning, opened its cover spangled
with tomato-colored fleurs-de-lys, skimmed through its yellowed
pages, I felt like I'd at last found something important. Why? I
bent again over the book's pages, searching for the cause of this
strange feeling. It wasn't the food exactly. If you looked hard
enough, the food started to feel almost beside the point. No,
there was something deeper here, some code within the words,
perhaps some secret embedded in the paper itself.</P>

<P>I have never looked to religion for comfort - belief is just not
in my genes. But reading <EM>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</EM> -
childishly simple and dauntingly complex, incantatory and comforting
- I thought this was what prayer must feel like. Sustenance
bound up with anticipation and want. Reading MtAoFC
was like reading pornographic Bible verses.</P>

<P>So naturally when I flew back to New York that May, I had
Mom's copy of the book stashed in my bag.</P>

<br>
<P>The thing you learn with Potage Parmentier is that "simple" is
not exactly the same as "easy." It had never occurred to me that
there was a difference until Eric and I sat down on our couch the
night of my appointment at the gynecologist's, three months after
stealing my mother's forty-year-old cookbook, and took our
first slurps of Julia Child's potato soup.</P>

<P>Certainly I had made easier dinners. Unwrapping a cellophaneswathed
hunk of London broil and tossing it under the broiler
was one method that came immediately to mind. Ordering pizza
and getting drunk on Stoli gimlets while waiting for it to arrive,
that was another favorite. Potage Parmentier didn't even hold a
candle, in the easy department.</P>


<P>First you peel a couple of potatoes and slice them up. Slice
some leeks, rinse them a couple of times to get rid of the grit-
leeks are muddy little suckers. Throw these two ingredients in a
pot with some water and some salt. Simmer it for forty-five minutes
or so, then either "mash the vegetables in the soup with a
fork" or pass them through a food mill. I didn't have a food mill,
and I wasn't about to mash up vegetables with a <EM>fork.</EM> What I had
was a potato ricer.</P>

<P>Well, technically it was Eric's potato ricer. Before we were married,
years ago, before Atkins hit, mashed potatoes used to be
Eric's specialty. For a while, before we learned the value of Brooklyn
storage space, we'd had this tradition where I'd get him arcane
kitchen gadgets, the not-very-funny joke being that he didn't actually
cook at all, except for the mashed potatoes. The ricer is the
only survivor from this period. It was his Christmas present the
year we were in the railroad apartment on Eleventh between Seventh
and Eighth-this was before we got priced out of Park
Slope entirely. I'd sewn stockings for the both of us out of felt-
his is red with white trim, mine white with red-from a pattern
in the Martha Stewart Living holiday issue that year. We still have
them, even though I can't sew and they're totally kattywhompus:
the stitching uneven, the decorative cuffs bunched and crooked.
They're also way too small for things like ricers. I stuffed it in anyway.
Hanging on the mantel of the nonfunctional fireplace in the
bedroom, the stocking looked like Santa had brought Eric a Luger.
I've never been much good at stocking stuffers.</P>

<P>Once the leeks and potatoes have simmered for an hour or so,
you mash them up with a fork or a food mill or a potato ricer. All
three of these options are far more of a pain in the neck than the
Cuisinart-one of which space-munching behemoths we scored
when we got married - but Julia Child allows as how a Cuisinart
will turn soup into "something un-French and monotonous."
Any suggestion that uses the construction "un-French" is up for
debate, but if you make Potage Parmentier, you will see her
point. If you use the ricer, the soup will have bits- green bits
and white bits and yellow bits - instead of being utterly smooth.
After you've mushed it up, just stir in a couple of hefty chunks of
butter, and you're done. JC says sprinkle with parsley but you
don't have to. It looks pretty enough as it is, and it smells glorious,
which is funny when you think about it. There's not a thing
in it but leeks, potatoes, butter, water, pepper, and salt.</P>

<P>One interesting thing to meditate on while you're making this
soup is potatoes. There's something about peeling a potato. Not
to say that it's fun, exactly. But there's something about scraping
off the skin, and rinsing off the dirt, and chopping it into cubes
before immersing the cubes in cold water because they'll turn
pink if you let them sit out in the air. Something about knowing
exactly what you're doing, and why. Potatoes have been potatoes
for a long, long time, and people have treated them in just this
way, toward the end of making just such a soup. There is clarity
in the act of peeling a potato, a winnowing down to one sure,
true way. And even if afterward you do push it through some
gadget you got at Crate and Barrel, the peeling is still a part of
what you do, the first thing.</P>

<P>I was supposed to have spent my twenties (a) hammering away
for ninety hours a week at some high-paying, ethically dubious
job, drinking heavily, and having explosive sex with a rich array of
twenty-something men; (b) awaking at noon every day in my
Williamsburg loft to work on my painting/poetry/knitting/
performance art, easily shaking off the effects of stylish drugs
and tragically hip clubs and explosive sex with a rich array of
twenty-something men (and women if I could manage it); or (c)
pursuing higher education, sweating bullets over an obscure dissertation
and punctuating my intellectual throes with some pot
and explosive sex with a rich array of professors and undergrads.
These were the models, for someone like me.</P>


<P>But I did none of these things. Instead, I got married. I didn't
mean to, exactly. It just kind of happened.</P>

<P>Eric and I were high school sweethearts. Wait, it gets worse. We
were in a high school play together. Our courtship was straight
out of one of the ickier films from the John Hughes oeuvre, <EM>Some
Kind of Wonderful,</EM> maybe-all kinds of misunderstandings and
jealous boyfriends and angst-ridden stage kisses. In other words,
the sort of too-typical high school romance that people of our
generation are meant to get over and cover up later on. But we
didn't. Somehow we never got around to the breaking-up part. At
the age of twenty-four, when we were still sleeping together and
reasonably satisfied with the whole toilet-seat-and-toothpaste-cap
situation, we went ahead and got married.</P>

<P>Please understand - I love my husband like a pig loves shit.
Maybe even more. But in the circles I run in, being married for
more than five years before reaching the age of thirty ranks real
high on the list of most socially damaging traits, right below
watching NASCAR and listening to Shania Twain. I'm used to
getting questions like "Is he the only person you've ever had sex
with?" or, even more insultingly, "Are you the only person he's
ever had sex with?"</P>

<P>All this to say that sometimes I get a little defensive. Even with
Isabel, who I've known since kindergarten, and Sally, my freshmanyear
roommate, and Gwen, who comes over to eat at our apartment
every weekend and adores Eric. I would confess to none of
them the thing I sometimes think, which is: "Eric can be a little
pushy." I couldn't hack the hastily smothered expressions of dismay
and smug I-told-you-so eyebrows; I know my friends would
imagine something between the <EM>The Stepford Wives</EM> and a domestic
abuse PSA narrated by J-Lo. But I mean neither shoving matches
nor domineering at dinner parties. I just mean that he pushes. He
can't be satisfied with telling me I'm the most gorgeous and talented
woman on the planet and that he would die without me,
while mixing me a dry Stoli gimlet. No, he has to encourage. He
has to make suggestions. It can be most annoying.</P>

<P>So I made this soup, this Potage Parmentier, from a recipe in a
forty-year-old cookbook I'd stolen from my mother the previous
spring. And it was good- inexplicably good. We ate it sitting on
the couch, bowls perched on knees, the silence broken only by
the occasional snort of laughter as we watched a pert blonde
high school student dust vampires on the television. In almost no
time we were slurping the dregs of our third servings. (It turns
out that one reason we're so good together is that each of us eats
more and faster than anyone either of us has ever met; also, we
both recognize the genius of <EM>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.)</EM> Earlier that
evening, after the gynecologist appointment, when I was standing
in the Korean deli staring at produce, I'd been thinking, "I'm
twenty-nine, I'm never going to have kids or a real job, my husband
will leave me and I'll die alone in an outer-borough hovel
with twenty cats and it'll take two weeks for the stench to reach
the hall." But now, three bowls of potato soup later, I was, to my
relief, thinking of nothing much at all. I lay on my back on the
couch, quietly digesting. Julia Child's soup had made me vulnerable.</P>

<P>Eric saw an in, and took it.
"That was good, honey."
I sighed my agreement.</P>

<P>"Real good. And there wasn't even any meat in it."
(Eric is a sensitive twenty-first-century sort of guy, but a Texan
nevertheless, and the idea of a dinner without animal flesh gets
him a little panicky.)</P>

<P>"You're such a good cook, Julie. Maybe you should go to culinary
school."</P>

<P>I'd started cooking in college, basically to keep Eric in my
thrall. In the years since, though, the whole thing had blown a
little out of proportion. I don't know if Eric felt pride that he had
introduced me to my consuming passion, or guilt that my urge to
satisfy his innocent liking for escargot and rhubarb had metastasized
into an unhealthy obsession. Whatever the reason, this thing
about cooking school had developed into one of our habitual
dead-end alleys of conversation. I was too deliciously idle after my
soup to get ticked off about it, and just snorted quietly. Even that
indication that he had my ear, though, was a tactical error. I knew
it as soon as I'd made a sound. I squeezed my eyes shut, feigning
sudden sleep or deafness.</P>

<P>"Seriously. You could go to the Culinary Institute! We could
move out to the Hudson Valley, and you could just spend all your
time learning to be a chef."</P>

<P>And then, no sooner than I'd cautioned myself against it, I
made tactical error #2: "They won't let me in without professional
experience. I'd have to go peel potatoes for two-fifty an
hour for six months. You want to support me with all your big
bucks while I do that?"</P>

<P>Giving in to the enticing prospect of emasculating my husband.
Always, always a mistake.</P>

<P>"Maybe some other school to start, then- somewhere here
in the city?"</P>

<P>"We can't afford it."</P>

<P>Eric didn't answer. He sat quietly on the edge of the couch
with his hand on my shin. I thought about kicking it off, but the
shin seemed a neutral enough spot. One of the cats jumped up
onto my chest, sniffed my breath, then stalked off stiff-legged,
her mouth open in faint disgust.</P>

<P>"If I wanted to learn to cook, I'd just cook my way through
<EM>Mastering the Art of French Cooking."</EM>
It was an odd sort of statement to make drip with sarcasm, but
I managed it anyway. Eric just sat there.</P>

<P>"Not that it would do me any good, of course. Can't get a job
out of that."
"At least we'd eat good for a while."</P>

<P>Now I was the one who said nothing for a moment, because of
course he was right about that.</P>

<P>"I'd be exhausted all the time. I'd get fat. We'd have to eat
brains. And eggs. I don't eat eggs, Eric. You know I don't eat eggs."
"No. You don't."
"It's a stupid idea."</P>

<P>Eric said nothing for a while. <EM>Buffy</EM> had ended and the news was
on-a correspondent was standing on a flooded street in Sheepshead
Bay, saying something about a broken water main. We sat
on the couch in our stuffy Bay Ridge living room, staring at the
screen as if we gave a damn. All around us teetered towers of
boxes, the looming reminder of our upcoming move.</P>

<P>When I look back on it now, it is as if I could actually hear the
taut creak of a fisherman giving out just a tiny bit of line when
Eric said: "You could start a blog."</P>

<P>I cut my eyes over to him in irritation, a massive white-skinned
shark thrashing its tail.</P>

<P>"Julie. You do know what a <EM>blog</EM> is, don't you?"
Of course I didn't know what a blog was. It was August of 2002.
Nobody knew about blogs, except for a few guys like Eric who
spend their days using company computers to pursue the zeitgeist.
No issue of domestic or international policy was too big, no
pop-culture backwater too obscure; from the War on Terror to
Fear Factor, it was all one big, beautiful sliding scale for Eric.
"You know, like a Web site sort of thing. Only it's easy. You
don't have to know anything about anything."</P>

<P>"Sounds perfect for me."
"About computers, I mean."
"Are you going to make me that drink, or what?"
"Sure."</P>

<P>And he did. He left me alone. He was free to, now that he
knew the hook was sunk.</P>

<P>Lulled by the calming music of ice clattering in the cocktail
shaker, I began to ponder; this life we had going for ourselves, Eric
and I, it felt like the opposite of Potage Parmentier. It was easy
enough to keep on with the soul-sucking jobs; at least it saved having
to make a choice. But how much longer could I take such an
easy life? Quicksand was easy. Hell, death was easy. Maybe that's
why my synapses had started snapping at the sight of potatoes and
leeks in the Korean deli. Maybe that was what was plucking deep
down in my belly whenever I thought of Julia Child's book. Maybe
I needed to make like a potato, winnow myself down, be a part of
something that was not easy, just simple.</P>

<P>Just then Eric emerged again from the kitchen, carrying two
Stoli gimlets. He handed off one of the glasses to me, carefully,
so as not to spill anything over those treacherous martini lips, and
I took a sip. Eric always made the best gimlets- icy cold, very
dry, with an almost-not-there shade of chartreuse lingering in
their slightly oily depths.</P>

<P>"Okay," I said, taking another sip as Eric sat down beside me.
"Tell me again about this blog thing?"</P>

<P>And so, late that evening, a tiny line dropped into the endless sea
of cyberspace, the slenderest of lures in the blackest of waters.</P>

<P><B>The Book</B></P>
<P><EM>Mastering the Art of French Cooking.</EM> First edition, 1961.
Louisette Bertholle. Simone Beck. And, of course, Julia Child,
the woman who taught America to cook, and to eat. Today we
think we live in the world Alice Waters made, but beneath it all
is Julia, and no one can touch her.</P>


<P><B>The Contender</B></P>
<P>Government drone by day, renegade foodie by night. Too old
for theater, too young for children, and too bitter for anything
else, Julie Powell was looking for a challenge. And in the
Julie/Julia Project she found it. Risking her marriage, her job,
and her cats' well-being, she has signed on for a deranged assignment.
365 days. 524 recipes. One girl and a crappy outerborough
kitchen. How far it will go, no one can say. . . .</P>


<P>It wasn't much - nearly nothing, in fact. Not even so much as
a recipe for potato soup. A few words strung together, is all. But
together, out there, they seemed perhaps to glow, only faintly.
Just enough.
