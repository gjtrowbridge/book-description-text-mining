<h4 align="center">Chapter One</h4>

<p><i>Lancashire, England<br>
April 5, 1816</i></p>

<p>The faint scratch at the front-door keyhole
caught Lady Rosalyn's attention as she
passed through the center hall on the way to her
front parlor. She paused, listening.</p>

<p>There it was again ... as if someone were trying
to unlock the door, which was not locked.</p>

<p>Rosalyn had just left her companion, Covey,
as she was finishing her breakfast in the back
morning room. Cook was in the kitchen and
Bridget, the maid, was upstairs gathering the
laundry. The other member of their small household,
Old John, Cook's husband and the gardener,
never used the front door, nor did any
of them, Rosalyn herself included. The front
door was for company, and she wasn't expecting
any.</p>

<p>She put her hand around the brass candlestick
sitting on a table by the door.</p>

<p>Whoever was there realized the door was unlocked.
The handle turned.</p>

<p>She lifted the candlestick over her head. The
stub of the candle in the stick fell out, bouncing
off her shoulder and onto the floor. She would
usually chase it down -- there wasn't enough
money to waste anything, including candle
stubs, in her household -- but this time, she had
other concerns.</p>

<p>The door started to open. A swirl of damp,
chilly air swept around her skirts. She mustered
her courage, held her breath, ready to swing --
and stopped.</p>

<p>It was no disreputable rogue who stood in her
doorway, rather a well-dressed gentleman. He
had to remove his hat and duck to come in her
narrow door without bumping his head. His
shoulders were so broad that he temporarily
blocked out the light of the first good sunny
spring day they'd had in April.</p>

<p>The gentleman looked startled to see her.
There was a day's growth of stubble on his jaw.
Buff leather breeches hugged horseman's thighs,
and his marine blue coat was cut to perfection.
He was a Corinthian, a Fashionable.</p>

<p>What was he doing at Maiden Hill?</p>

<p>His gaze followed up her arms to the candlestick
she wielded with wicked intent. He held up
a hand, warding her off. "I'm sorry. I see I've
startled you."</p>

<p>Rosalyn had two instantaneous thoughts: the
first, that she'd never met this gentleman before,
and the second, that in spite of a shadow of unshaven
whiskers, he had to be the most undeniably
handsome man she'd ever laid eyes on. The
mud splattering his boots, the tangled curls of
his dark hair, and the loose, devil-may-care knot
in his neck cloth told her she was right in thinking
he was not from the Valley. He'd apparently
been riding hard and for some distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly self-conscious of her own country-made
dress in a serviceable gray broadcloth, she
demanded, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm the new owner of this house. I say, do you
mind putting down that candlestick. You look
ready to crack my skull with it."</p>

<p>"The new owner--?" Rosalyn started to lower
the candlestick and then raised it back up again as
her common sense rejected his claim. He couldn't
be the owner&#151;she was! "Leave now peacefully
before I-I-" She hesitated, at a loss for words. Before
she did what to such a giant?</p>

<p>Nor was he afraid. "Before you beat me around
the ears until I'm bloody?" he suggested helpfully,
his tone amused. "Or grab me by the scruff
of the neck and toss me out?"</p>

<p>Rosalyn didn't answer. She couldn't. The rich,
deep masculinity of his voice sparked something
inside her she'd thought long dead or at least put
in its proper place -- a very definite interest in the
opposite sex.</p>

<p>He took the candlestick from her hands and
smiled. She was blinded into dizziness. No man
should have a smile so devastating.</p>

<p>Then he brought her to her senses by asking,
"So, are you one of the servants?"</p>

<p>Rosalyn didn't know if she could believe her
ears. Yes, she was wearing the dress she reserved
for household tasks and one, like most of her
wardrobe, that was long out of fashion. And, yes,
this morning, she'd done little more than toss her
hair up in a quick knot at the nape of her neck
and fasten it in place with a pin or two. Still, his
question was a douse of cold reality. His appeal
evaporated.</p>

<p>"I beg <i>your</i> pardon," she countered with every
ounce of aristocratic hauteur bred into her. "Who
are you?"</p>

<p>His brows rose as he realized his mistake. He set the candlestick on
the side table before saying, "Colin Mandland, <i>Colonel</i>
Colin Mandland."</p>

<P>She knew the surname. Reverend Mandland
was the vicar of St. Mary Magdalene's Church.
"Have we met before?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Are you going to tell me who
you are?"</p>

<p>The abrupt response from someone who had
just walked into her house set Rosalyn's back up.
"I am the woman who <i>owns</i> this house. Not you.
Now, sir, I will ask you to take yourself and your
rude manners elsewhere. If you don't, I will take
action." She reached out to close the door, irritated
enough to push even a big ox like himself
out of the way if necessary, but he blocked the
door's closing with his arm, his next words stopping
her cold.</p>

<p>"I bought this house from Lord Woodford. I
even have a key." He held it up for her to see.</p>

<p>Rosalyn froze at the mention of her cousin
George. She met Colonel Mandland's gaze, praying
he was jesting. He wasn't. She took the key,
wanting to touch it to prove it was real.</p>

<p>Alarm ripped through her. She dropped her
hand from the door. "George wouldn't? ... At
least, not without saying something--?"</p>
