<h4 align="center">Chapter One</h4>

<p>I never believed in dharma, karma, reincarnation, or
any of that spiritual crap, which caused sort of a problem
growing up because my parents are devout Hindus.
Dharma, by the way, means life purpose in Sanskrit. By
the time my thirtieth birthday rolled around, I still
hadn't found my dharma, which caused my parents
some worry, [read: anxiety, loss of sleep, despair, handwringing,
tears, dizzy spells and a constant mumbling of
nasty things about me in Hindi under their breath].</p>

<p>My birthday fell on the second Saturday of January,
and as I zipped down Pacific Coast Highway in my canary
yellow Hummer H2, I thought about upgrading to
a bigger car.</p>

<p>Newport Beach, where we live, is a nice-looking
beach city. Streets are wide, cars are expensive, bodies
are beautiful, and neighborhoods are well tended. A
French Colonial&#150;style roof is not allowed when the zoning
laws call for Spanish. For your coffee-drinking pleasure
there is a Starbucks on every corner.</p>

<p>I like living in a place where the air is clean and neighbors
hide their trash in discreet garbage cans made to
blend in with the shrubbery. I am, however, tired of the
impression that blond, blue-eyed families are the sole inhabitants
of Newport Beach. This isn't Sweden for God's
sake.</p>

<p>Indian people like to bitch about the big bad British
ruling India for two hundred years. Big deal. Try growing
up in Orange County. Most of my cousins sport blue
contact lenses and dye their hair ash-blond. How's that
for colonial impact?</p>

<p>For the record, I do not dye my dark tresses. I do,
however, highlight.</p>

<p>I'd spent the afternoon enjoying a manicure and pedicure
at the Bella Salon and Spa, followed by shopping at
South Coast Plaza. My birthday happened to fall on a
Saturday, but even if it hadn't, my plan would have been
the same, one of the benefits to being unemployed.</p>

<p>Eight shopping bags later I was back in my SUV slurping
on a Mocha Frappuccino. I'm not into meditation,
and I don't do yoga. I don't blast sitar music in my car either.
I prefer Madonna. I turned up the volume and felt
my spirits rise.</p>

<p>As if it hadn't been bad enough rolling out of bed this
morning knowing it was the start of my third decade, the
night before my aunt Gayatri, a gynecologist, had come
over to the house lugging an enormous chart of the female
reproductive system.</p>

<p>By the time she was done I knew more about my vulva than I ever wanted to, and that I was fast on my
way to acquiring the shriveled ovaries of a crone. Basically
my dear aunt was hinting I'd better find a man and
reproduce then and there. Well duh! She couldn't have
been less subtle if she'd hit me over the head with the
pink plastic vagina she kept in the car.</p>

<p>In traditional Indian culture, a woman is supposed to
get married and have children -- strictly in that order -- by
the time she's twenty-five. My female cousins and I,
having been born and raised in America, have it considerably
harder, not easier. We're all supposed to get married,
have children, and be either a doctor, lawyer, or
engineer, all by the time we're twenty-five.</p>

<p>My female cousins all found proper careers, married
proper Indian boys, had proper Indian weddings, and
properly lavish wedding receptions. If I ever get married,
I definitely will not have some decrepit Hindu priest
muttering in Sanskrit while pouring clarified butter over
a fire, as I struggle not to inhale great quantities of
smoke, praying frantically that my sari doesn't unravel,
fall off, or burst into flames.</p>

<p>Now instead of spending my birthday with people
whose company I enjoyed, I was on my way home to
have dinner with my family. The last thing I wanted to
do was eat Indian food and discuss recent advances in
medical science. Hobnobbing with doctors wasn't my
idea of fun. If it were, I'd be crashing AMA conferences
across the state.</p>

<p>My mom's a pediatrician in private practice, my dad, a renowned urologist, and I mean the man gets absolutely
giddy over bladder infections. My younger brother,
Samir, is in his final year at Stanford Medical School. In
fact, of all the ninety-seven adult members of the Mehra
clan spread throughout the United States, ninety-six are
doctors, the sole exception being yours truly.</p>

<p>Thereby proving, that contrary to popular belief India
produces far more doctors than snake charmers. I would
put engineers at a close second and, okay, maybe snake
charmers at third.</p>

<p>Thereby also proving, that if life were a vegetarian Indian
buffet, I'd be one, big, steaming plate of haggis.</p>

<p>I thought fleetingly of avoiding the dinner tonight, but
with my mom it wasn't a request, it was an order. God,
just because I live at home and spend their money, my
parents think they can tell me what to do.</p>


<p><br />Maybe it was the fact I was consuming a beverage, conversing
on my cell phone, and steering my behemoth of
a car, but I failed to notice the dark blue Mercedes S600
parked on the curb in front of our Mediterranean-style
house. I pulled into the three-car garage, left the bags in
the back for later, and stepped inside.</p>

<p>"Maya!" I was nearly knocked over as my aunt barreled
into me. Now I'm not that tall, about five-three.
Aunt Dimple, a dermatologist, barely comes up to my
chin. In a detail that greatly puzzled me as a child, Aunt
Dimple did not have a single dimple on her face. "Happy
birthday! I can't wait to tell you my surprise!" As I stared down at her, I felt a sick malignant tumor of dread take
form in my stomach.</p>

<p>"Tell her the news, Dimpy," my dad smiled.</p>

<p>The Queen of Retin-A, who cleared up my adolescent
outbreak of acne, and was responsible for the glowing
complexion I possess today, now stood in front of me,
and I wanted nothing more than for the Earth to open
up and swallow her plump, perky form.</p>

<p>It&#146;s hard to find an Indian family without an aunt
Dimple. Aunt Dimples have one hobby and one hobby
only.</p>

<p>Matchmaking.</p>

<p>At that moment, pink plastic vagina or not, I&#146;d have
given anything for my aunt Gayatri.
