Excuse me, sir, but may I be of assistance?  Ah, I see I have alarmed you.
Do not be frightened by my beard: I am a lover  of America. I noticed that
you were looking for something; more than looking,  in fact you seemed to
be on a mission, and since I am both a native of this  city and a speaker
of your language, I thought I might offer you my  services.
<BR><BR>
How did I know you were American? No, not by the color of your skin;  we
have a range of complexions in this country, and yours occurs often  among
the people of our northwest frontier. Nor was it your dress that gave  you
away; a European tourist could as easily have purchased in Des Moines  your
suit, with its single vent, and your button-down shirt. True, your  hair,
short-cropped, and your expansive chest -- the chest, I would say, of  a
man who bench-presses regularly, and maxes out well above  two-twenty-five
-- are typical of a certain type of American; but then again,  sportsmen
and soldiers of all nationalities tend to look alike. Instead, it  was your
bearing that allowed me to identify you, and I do not mean that as  an
insult, for I see your face has hardened, but merely as an  observation.
<BR><BR>
Come, tell me, what were you looking for? Surely, at this time of  day,
only one thing could have brought you to the district of Old Anarkali  --
named, as you may be aware, after a courtesan immured for loving a  prince
-- and that is the quest for the perfect cup of tea. Have I  guessed
correctly? Then allow me, sir, to suggest my favorite among these  many
establishments. Yes, this is the one. Its metal chairs are no  better
upholstered, its wooden tables are equally rough, and it is, like  the
others, open to the sky. But the quality of its tea, I assure you,  is
unparalleled.
<BR><BR>
You prefer that seat, with your back so close to the wall? Very  well,
although you will benefit less from the intermittent breeze, which,  when
it does blow, makes these warm afternoons more pleasant. And will you  not
remove your jacket? So formal! Now that is not typical of Americans,  at
least not in my experience. And my experience is substantial: I spent  four
and a half years in your country. Where? I worked in New York, and  before
that attended college in New Jersey. Yes, you are right: it was  Princeton!
Quite a guess, I must say.
<BR><BR>
What did I think of Princeton? Well, the answer to that question  requires
a story. When I first arrived, I looked around me at the Gothic  buildings
-- younger, I later learned, than many of the mosques of this city,  but
made through acid treatment and ingenious stonemasonry to look older  --
and thought, This is a dream come true. Princeton inspired in me  the
feeling that my life was a film in which I was the star and everything  was
possible. I have access to this beautiful campus, I thought, to  professors
who are titans in their fields and fellow students who  are
philosopher-kings in the making.
<BR><BR>
I was, I must admit, overly generous in my initial assumptions about  the
standard of the student body. They were almost all intelligent, and  many
were brilliant, but whereas I was one of only two Pakistanis in  my
entering class -- two from a population of over a hundred million  souls,
mind you -- the Americans faced much less daunting odds in the  selection
process. A thousand of your compatriots were enrolled, five hundred  times
as many, even though your country's population was only twice that  of
mine. As a result, the non-Americans among us tended on average to  do
better than the Americans, and in my case I reached my senior year  without
having received a single B.
<BR><BR>
Looking back now, I see the power of that system, pragmatic and  effective,
like so much else in America. We international students were  sourced from
around the globe, sifted not only by well-honed standardized  tests but by
painstakingly customized evaluations -- interviews,  essays,
recommendations -- until the best and the brightest of us had  been
identified. I myself had among the top exam results in Pakistan and  was
besides a soccer player good enough to compete on the varsity team,  which
I did until I damaged my knee in my sophomore year. Students like me  were
given visas and scholarships, complete financial aid, mind you,  and
invited into the ranks of the meritocracy. In return, we were expected  to
contribute our talents to your society, the society we were joining.  And
for the most part, we were happy to do so. I certainly was, at least  at
first.
<BR><BR>
Every fall, Princeton raised her skirt for the corporate recruiters  who
came onto campus and -- as you say in America -- showed them some  skin.
The skin Princeton showed was good skin, of course -- young, eloquent,  and
clever as can be -- but even among all that skin, I knew in my senior  year
that I was something special. I was a perfect breast, if you will --  tan,
succulent, seemingly defiant of gravity -- and I was confident of  getting
any job I wanted.
<BR><BR>
Except one: Underwood Samson & Company. You have not heard of them?  They
were a valuation firm. They told their clients how much businesses  were
worth, and they did so, it was said, with a precision that was  uncanny.
They were small -- a boutique, really, employing a bare minimum of  people
-- and they paid well, offering the fresh graduate a base salary of  over
eighty thousand dollars. But more importantly, they gave one a robust  set
of skills and an exalted brand name, so exalted, in fact, that after  two
or three years there as an analyst, one was virtually guaranteed  admission
to Harvard Business School. Because of this, over a hundred members  of the
Princeton Class of 2001 sent their grades and r�sum�s to Underwood  Samson.
Eight were selected -- not for jobs, I should make clear, but  for
interviews -- and one of them was me.
<BR><BR>
You seem worried. Do not be; this burly fellow is merely our waiter,  and
there is no need to reach under your jacket, I assume to grasp  your
wallet, as we will pay him later, when we are done. Would you  prefer
regular tea, with milk and sugar, or green tea, or perhaps their  more
fragrant specialty, Kashmiri tea? Excellent choice. I will have the  same,
and perhaps a plate of jalebis as well. There. He has gone. I must  admit,
he is a rather intimidating chap. But irreproachably polite: you  would
have been surprised by the sweetness of his speech, if only you  understood
Urdu.
<BR><BR>
Where were we? Ah yes, Underwood Samson. On the day of my interview, I  was
uncharacteristically nervous. They had sent a single interviewer, and  he
received us in a room at the Nassau Inn, an ordinary room, mind you, not  a
suite; they knew we were sufficiently impressed already. When my  turn
came, I entered and found a man physically not unlike yourself; he,  too,
had the look of a seasoned army officer. "Changez?" he said, and I  nodded,
for that is indeed my name. "Come on in and take a seat."
