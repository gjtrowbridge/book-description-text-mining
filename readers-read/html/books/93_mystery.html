<div><B>Chapter Excerpt</B></div><BR><h4 align="center">Chapter One</h4>

<p>Just because I know how to change a guy's oil doesn't mean I
want to spend the rest of my life on my back, staring up his
undercarriage. Been there, done that. Okay, so my dad owns
a garage. And okay, I have a natural aptitude for rebuilding
carburetors. There comes a time in a girl's life when she needs
to trade in her mechanic's overalls for a pair of Manolo Blahnik
stilettos. Not that I can afford a lot of Manolos, but it's a goal,
right?</p>

<p>My name is Alexandra Barnaby, and I worked in my dad's
garage in the Canton section of Baltimore all through high
school and during summer breaks when I was in college. It's
not a big fancy garage, but it holds its own, and my dad has a
reputation for being an honest mechanic.</p>

<p>When I was twelve my dad taught me how to use an
acetylene torch. After I mastered welding, he gave me some
spare parts and our old lawn mower, and I built myself a
go-cart. When I was sixteen, I started rebuilding a ten-year-old junker Chevy. I turned it into a fast car. And I raced it in
the local stocks for two years.</p>

<p>"And here she comes, folks," the announcer would say.
"Barney Barnaby. Number sixteen, the terror of Baltimore
County. She's coming up on the eight car. She's going to the
inside. Wait a minute, I see flames coming from sixteen.
There's a lot of smoke now. Looks like she's blown another
engine. Good thing she works in her dad's garage."</p>

<p>So I could build cars, and I could drive cars. I just never
got the hang of driving them without destroying them.</p>

<p>"Barney," my dad would say. "I swear you blow those
engines just so you can rebuild them."</p>

<p>Maybe on an <em>un</em>conscious level. The brain is a pretty weird
thing. What I knew was that on a <em>conscious</em> level, I hated losing.
And I lost more races than I won. So, I raced two seasons and
packed it in.</p>

<p>My younger brother, Wild Bill, drove, too. He never cared
if he won or lost. He just liked to drive fast and scratch his
balls with the rest of the guys. Bill was voted Most Popular
of his senior class and also Least Likely to Succeed.</p>

<p>The class's expectation for Bill's success was a reflection of
Bill's philosophy of life. <em>If work was any fun, it would be
called play</em>. I've always been the serious kid, and Bill's always
been the kid who knew how to have a good time. Two years
ago, Bill said <em>good-bye</em> Baltimore and <em>hello</em> Miami. He liked
the lazy hot sun, the open water, and the girls in bikinis.</p>

<p>Two days ago, Bill disappeared off the face of the earth.
And he did it while I was talking to him. He woke me up with
a phone call in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>"Barney," Bill yelled over the phone line. "I have to leave
Miami for a while. Tell Mom I'm okay."</p>

<p>I squinted at my bedside clock. Two AM. Not late for Bill
who spent a lot of time in South Beach bars. Real late for me
who worked nine to five and went to bed at ten.</p>

<p>"What's that noise?" I asked him. "I can hardly hear you."</p>

<p>"Boat engine. Listen, I don't want you to worry if you
don't hear from me. And if some guys show up looking for
me, don't tell them anything. Unless it's Sam Hooker. Tell
Sam Hooker he can kiss my exhaust pipe."</p>

<p>"Guys? What guys? And what do you mean, don't tell
them anything?"</p>

<p>"I have to go. I have to ... <em>oh shit</em>."</p>

<p>I heard a woman scream in the background, and the line
went dead.</p>


<p><br />Baltimore is cold in January. The wind whips in from the harbor
and slices up the side streets, citywide. We get a couple
snowstorms each year and some freezing rain, but mostly we
get bone-chilling gray gloom. In the midst of the gray gloom,
pots of chili bubble on stoves, beer flows like water, sausages
are stuffed into hard rolls, and doughnuts are a necessity to
survival.</p>

<p>Miami, it turns out, is <em>hot</em> in January. I'd taken the midday
flight out of BWI, arriving in Miami midafternoon. When I left
home I was wrapped in a quilted down-filled coat, cashmere
Burberry scarf, fleece-lined boots, and heavy-duty shearling
mittens. Perfect for Baltimore. Not great for Miami. On arrival, I'd crammed the scarf and mittens into the mediumsize
duffel bag that hung from my shoulder, wrapped my coat
around the duffel bag handle, and went in search of the taxi
stand. Sweat was soaking into my Victoria's Secret Miracle
Bra, my hair was plastered to my forehead, and I was sucking
in air that felt like hot soup.</p>

<p>I'm thirty years old now. Average height and average build.
I'm not movie-star gorgeous, but I'm okay. My hair is naturally
mousy brown, but I started bleaching it blond when I
decided to stop being a grease monkey. It's currently platinum
and cut in a medium-length shaggy kind of style that I can
punk up with paste if the occasion arises. I have blue eyes, a
mouth that's a little too big for my face, and a perfect nose
inherited from my Grandma Jean.</p>

<p>My parents took Bill and me to Disney World when I was
nine. That's the extent of my in-the-flesh Florida experience.
The rest of my Florida knowledge consists mainly of horrific
bug stories from my mom's friend Elsie Duchen. Elsie winters
in Ocala with her daughter. Elsie swears there are cockroaches
as big as cows in Florida. And she says they can fly. I'm here
to tell you, if I see a cow-size cockroach fly by, I'm gone ...
