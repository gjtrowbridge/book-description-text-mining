              <p><b><font face="Verdana">Excerpt: Chapter 1</font></b></p>
              <font face="Verdana" size="2">
                Back to the main <i><a href="missingjustice.htm">Missing Justice</a></i>
                page</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If it's true that dreams come from the id, then
my id is not particularly creative. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dream that makes its way into my bed tonight
is the same one that has troubled my sleep almost every night for the past
month. Once again, I relive the events that led to the deaths of three men.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The walls of the stairway pass as a man follows
me upstairs. I force myself to focus on my own movements, trying to block out
thoughts of the other man downstairs, armed and determined to kill me when I
return. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Time slows as I duck beside my bed, reach for
the pistol hidden inside my nightstand, and rise up to surprise him. The .25
caliber automatic breaks the silence; more shots follow downstairs. Glass
shatters. Heavy footsteps thunder through the house. In the dream, I see bullets
rip through flesh and muscle, the scene tinted red like blood smeared across my
retinas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I usually wake during the chaos. Tonight,
though, the silence returns, and I walk past the dead bodies to my kitchen. I
open the pantry door and find a woman whose face I know only from photographs
and a brief introduction two years ago. She is crouched on the floor with her
head between her knees. When she looks up at me and reaches for my hand, the
phone rings, and I'm back in my bedroom. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is four o'clock in the morning, and as usual
I wake up chilly, having kicked my comforter deep into the crevice between my
mattress and the footboard of my maple sleigh bed. I fumble for the phone on my
nightstand, still ringing in the dark. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This better be worth it,&quot; I say.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's Detective Raymond Johnson of the Portland
Police Bureau's Major Crimes Team. A member of the search team has found a
woman's size-seven black Cole Haan loafer in the gutter, but Clarissa
Easterbrook is still missing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The call came</b> only eight hours after my boss,
District Attorney Duncan Griffith, had first summoned me to the Easterbrook
home. It was my first call-out after a month-long hiatus and a new promotion
from the Drug and Vice Division into Major Crimes. I was told it would just be
some quick PR work to transition me back into the office. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So far, the transition had been rough. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When I
pulled into the Easterbrook driveway that first evening, I cut the engine and
sat for a few last quiet moments in my Jetta. Noticing Detective Johnson waiting
for me at the front window, I took a deep breath, released the steering wheel,
and climbed out of the car, grabbing my briefcase from the passenger seat as I
exhaled. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I climbed a series of steep slate steps, a trek
made necessary by the home's impressive hillside location. Despite the spring
mist, I was able to take in the exterior. Dr. Townsend Easterbrook was clearly
no slouch. I wasn't sure which was bigger, the double-door entranceway or the
Expedition I'd parked next to. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson opened one of the doors before I'd had a
chance to use either of the square pewter knockers. I could make out voices at
the back of the house; Johnson kept his own down. &quot;Sat in that car so long,
Kincaid, thought something might be wrong with your feet.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At least my first case back on the job brought
some familiar faces. I had met Raymond Johnson and his partner, Jack Walker,
only two months ago, when I was a mere drug and vice deputy. But given the
history, however recent, I felt a bond with these guys -- the gunky kind that
threatens to stick around for good. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You must not have given up all hope, Johnson.
You were waiting at the door.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I was beginning to wonder, but then you tripped
something off walking up the path, and I heard a voice somewhere announcing a
visitor. George fucking Jetson house. Gives me the creeps.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Easterbrook home wasn't exactly cozy, but
I'd take it. Neutral colors, steel, and low sleek furniture -- the place was a
twenty-first century update on 1960s kitsch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With any luck, Clarissa Easterbrook would turn
up soon, and there'd be no need to disrupt all this coolness. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson caught my eye as I studied the house.
&quot;Look at you, girl. You're almost as dark as I am.&quot; He grabbed my hand and held
it next to the back of his. Not even close. Johnson's beautiful skin is about as
dark as it comes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Yeah, but you're <i>still</i> better looking.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He
laughed but it was true. He also dressed better than me -- more Hollywood red
carpet than police precinct linoleum. &quot;Griffith dragged you back from Maui just
for this?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I flew in last night. I sort of assumed I'd have Sunday to myself before I
headed back in tomorrow, but the boss must have thought it would do me good to
get some hand-holding practice while we wait for Easterbrook to turn up. You
know, ease me out of drug cases into the new gig.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;They usually do,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Turn up, I
mean. She probably went shopping and lost track of time or went out for a drink
with the girls.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Right, because, of course, that's all women do
in their spare time: shopping and girl talk.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This is going to take some getting used to,
Kincaid, after seven years of MCT work with O'Donnell.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I didn't react to the mention of my predecessor.
&quot;Just doing my part to lead you down the path of enlightenment, Ray. Clarissa
Easterbrook's an administrative law judge, not some bored housewife.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Oh, so it's only women lawyers who excel beyond
malls and gossip. Got it. Note to all detectives,&quot; he said, as if he were
speaking into a dictation recorder, &quot;the new Major Crimes Unit DA says it's
still OK to dis' housewives.&quot; He dropped the routine and cocked a finger at me.
&quot;Busted!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There was no arguing it, so I laughed instead.
&quot;Who's in the back?&quot; I asked, leaning my head toward the ongoing murmurs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Walker's back there with the husband and the
sister. We got here about half an hour ago, and the sister showed up right after.
We haven't been able to do much more than try to calm them down. We need to
start working on the timeline, though. I stayed out here to wait for you. I
suspect Dr. Easterbrook's still getting used to having a brother in the house.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was unusual to have MCT involved so early in
a missing persons case, but Walker and Johnson were here from the bureau's Major
Crimes Team for the same reason I was: to make sure that our offices looked
responsive and concerned when the missing judge showed up and to triple-check
that the investigation was perfect, just in case she didn't. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Sounds good. I'll do my part for the family and
any press, but for now you guys take the lead on interviews.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Music to my ears, Kincaid.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He began walking toward the back of the house,
but I stopped him with a hand on his elbow. &quot;I assume you're keeping things
gentle for now, just in case. And absolutely no searches, not even with
consent.&quot; If Clarissa Easterbrook had encountered anything criminal, everyone
close to her would become a suspect, especially her husband. We couldn't do
anything now that might jeopardize our investigation down the road. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I should've known it was too good to be true.
All DAs just got to have their say. It's in the blood.&quot; I could tell from his
smile that he wasn't annoyed. &quot;No worries, now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We made our way to the kitchen, walking past a
built-in rock fountain that served as a room divider. The Easterbrooks had
sprung for marble countertops and stainless steel, Sub-Zero everything, but it
looked like no one ever cooked here. In fact, as far as I could tell, no one
even <i>lived</i> here. The only hint of disorder was in a corner of the kitchen, where
the contents of a canvas book bag were spread out on the counter next to a
frazzled-looking brunette. She had a cell phone to one ear and an index finger
in the other. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack Walker greeted us. With his short sleeves,
striped tie, and bald head, he had enough of the cop look going to make up for
his partner. &quot;Welcome back. You look great,&quot; he said into my ear as he shook my
hand with a friendly squeeze. &quot;Dr. Easterbrook, this is Deputy District Attorney
Samantha Kincaid.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are women who would describe Townsend
Easterbrook as good-looking. His brown hair was worn just long enough and with
just enough gray at the temples to suggest a lack of attention to appearance,
but the Brooks Brothers clothes told another story. On the spectrum between
sloppy apathetic and sloppy preppy, there was no question where this man fell. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He seemed alarmed by the introduction. At first I assumed he was nervous. I
quickly realized it was something else entirely. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Please, call me Townsend. Gosh, I apologize if I was staring. I recognized you
from the news, but it took me a moment to draw the connection.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It hadn't dawned on me that, at least for the
foreseeable future, former strangers would know me as the local Annie Oakley.
One more daily annoyance. Terrific. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I'm sorry to meet you under these
circumstances, Dr. Easterbrook. Duncan had to be in Salem tonight, but he wanted
me to assure you that our office will do everything within our power to help
find your wife.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Griffith called, he had insisted that I use
his first name with the family and assure Dr. Easterbrook that he would have
been here personally if he weren't locked in legislative hearings all week.
Other missing people might disappear with little or no official response, but
Dr. Easterbrook's phone call to 911 had ripped like a lightning bolt through the
power echelon. The wife was sure to turn up, but this was Griffith's chance to
say <i>I feel your pain</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And Easterbrook clearly <i>was</i> in pain. &quot;Thank you
for coming so quickly,&quot; he said, his voice shaking. &quot;I feel foolish now that
you're all here, but we weren't sure what we should be doing. Clarissa's sister
and I have been calling everyone we can possibly think of.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;That's your sister-in-law?&quot; I asked, looking
toward the woman in the corner, still clutching the phone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Yes. Tara. She came in from The Dalles. I
called her earlier to see if she'd heard from Clarissa today. Then I called her
again when I saw that Griffey was gone, too.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Walker tapped the pocket-size notebook he held
in his hand  with a dainty gold pen that didn't suit him. Most likely a gift
from one of his six daughters, it looked tiny between his sausage fingers. &quot;Dr.
Easterbrook was just telling me he got home from the hospital at six-thirty
tonight. His wife was home when he left this morning at six.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A twelve-hour day probably wasn't unusual for
the attending surgeon at The Oregon Health Sciences University, even on a
Sunday. Looking at him now, though, it was hard to imagine him steadying a
scalpel just four hours ago. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Easterbrook continued where he must have left
off. &quot;She was still in bed when I left. Sort of awake but still asleep.&quot; He was
staring blankly in front of him, probably remembering how cute his wife is when
she is sleepy. &quot;She hadn't mentioned any plans, so when I got home and she
wasn't here, I assumed she went out to the market. We usually have dinner in on
Sundays, as long as I'm home.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You've checked for her car,&quot; Walker said. It
was more of a statement than a question. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Right. That was the first thing I did once I
was out of my scrubs: I changed clothes and walked down to the garage. When I
saw the Lexus, I thought she must have walked somewhere. I tried her cell, but I
kept getting her voice mail. Finally, around eight, I thought to look out back
for Griffey. When I saw he was gone too, I drove around the
neighborhood for what must have been an hour. I finally got so worried I called
the police.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the corner, Clarissa's sister snapped her
cell phone shut and blew her bangs from her eyes. &quot;That's it. I've called
everyone,&quot; she said, looking up. &quot;Oh, sorry. I didn't realize anyone else was
here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;From the District Attorney's office,&quot; Townsend
explained. &quot;Ms. -- Kincaid, this is Clarissa's sister, Tara Carney.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was hard to see the resemblance. My guess is
they were both pushing forty, Tara perhaps a little harder, but they had been
different kinds of years. Clarissa was a thin frosted blonde who favored pastel
suits and high heels. Tara's dark brown pageboy framed a round face, and she
looked at ease -- at least physically -- in her dark green sweat suit and
sneakers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She acknowledged me with a nod. &quot;I called
everyone I can think of, and no one's heard from her today. This just isn't like
her.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;She's never gone out for the day without
telling someone?&quot; Walker asked. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">They both shook their heads in frustration.
&quot;Nothing like this at all,&quot; Townsend said. &quot;She often runs late at work during
the week, we both do. But she wouldn't just leave the house like this on the
weekend. With the dog, for hours? Something must be wrong.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We asked all the other obvious questions, but
Tara and Townsend had covered the bases before dialing 911. They had knocked on
doors, but the neighbors hadn't noticed anything. Clarissa hadn't left a note.
They didn't even know what she was wearing, because when Townsend left that
morning she was still in her pajamas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her purse and keys were missing along with
Griffey, but Townsend doubted she was walking the dog. She always walked him in
the morning, and sometimes they walked him together after dinner if they were
both home. But she didn't take Griffey out alone after dark. Anyway, we were
talking about ten-minute potty trips, not all-night strolls. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Walker was rising from his chair. &quot;Finding out
how she's dressed is a priority.&quot; He was shifting into action mode. &quot;If we go
through some of her things, do you think you might be able to figure out what
she's wearing?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;<i>You</i> would be the one to go through your wife's
belongings,&quot; I corrected. We had to keep this by the book. &quot;I think what
Detective Walker's suggesting is that you might be able to tell what clothes are
missing if you look at what's here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Right,&quot; Walker agreed. &quot;And it would help to
get a detailed description out as fast as possible.&quot; It would also help us
determine if we were all wasting our time. Maybe Clarissa had packed a suitcase
and her dog to run off voluntarily with a new man -- or simply to a new life
without this one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You either overestimate my familiarity with
clothing or underestimate Clarissa's wardrobe. Tara, can you help? I doubt I can
be of any use.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I suggested that we all go upstairs together
while Tara looked through Clarissa's closet. Johnson offered to stay downstairs
in case anyone knocked, but Easterbrook assured him that the house's &quot;smart
system&quot; would alert us if anyone approached the door. Of course, Johnson already
knew that, so I gave him a warning look over my shoulder to join me as I followed
Townsend and Tara up the hammered-steel staircase. No way was he sneaking around
down here while the family was upstairs, especially in a house with its own
intelligence system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Easterbrook master suite was the size of my
entire second floor, a thousand square feet of spa-style opulence. Townsend led
us through a large sitting area, past the king-size bed, and around the back of
a partial wall that served as the beds headboard. I couldn't help but notice
that the lip balm on the nightstand was the same brand as my own, the paperback
novel one I'd read last year. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The back of the suite contained a marble-rich
bathroom adjoining a dressing area roughly the size of Memphis. Townsend wasn't
kidding about his wife's wardrobe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tara started flipping through the piles of
folded clothes stacked neatly into maple cubes. The hanging items looked
work-related. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After she'd gone through the top two rows, Tara
blew her bangs out of her face again. &quot;She tends to wear the same few things
when she's around the house, but the ones I can remember are all here. I just
don't know.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Townsend stood in the corner of the closet,
seemingly distracted by a pair of Animal Cracker print pajamas that hung from a
hook. Tara was unfazed by the moment's poignancy, or at least she did not let it
halt her determination. She was examining rows of shoes stacked neatly on a rack
built into the side of the closet. &quot;Well, it looks like her favorite black
loafers are gone. Cole Haans, I think. But I can't tell what clothes are
missing; she's just got too much stuff.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She walked over to a Nordstrom shopping bag on
the floor next to the dressing table. She pulled out a red sweater, set it on
the table and then reached back in and removed some loose price tags and a
receipt. &quot;These are from yesterday,&quot; she said, looking at the receipt. &quot;Town,
these are Clarissa's, right?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She had to repeat the question before he
responded. &quot;Oh, right, she did mention something about that last night, I
think.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Can you tell anything from the tags?' Walker
asked. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No,&quot; Tara said. &quot;Well, the brand name, but then
it's just those meaningless style names and numbers.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Did anyone go shopping with her? We could find
out what she bought from them,&quot; I suggested. I knew I told Johnson I'd leave the
questions to them, but I couldn't help myself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Townsend seemed to wake up for a moment. &quot;I
believe she went with Susan, but --&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Walker interrupted, holding up his
pen and pad. &quot;What's Susan's last name?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tara looked disappointed. &quot;Susan Kerr, a friend
of my sisters. I've already tried calling her, and all I got was the machine.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A store clerk would be able to determine from
the item number what clothes Clarissa purchased Saturday. It wouldn't be easy to
get that information at eleven o'clock on a Sunday night, but it was worth
trying. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We'll track someone down from the store,&quot; I
suggested, looking toward Ray and Jack. &quot;Can't we pull a number for someone at
Nordstrom out of PPDS?&quot; The Portland Police Data System compiled information
from every city police report and was the handiest source for accessing an
individual's contact information. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Within a few minutes, Walker had the home
telephone number of a store manager mentioned in a recent theft case. A manager
would not be involved in your average shoplifting case, but this one had been
unusual. An employee at one of the local thrift stores had bilked Nordstrom out
of thousands of dollars in cash by taking advantage of its famously tolerant
return policy. The bureau estimated that every Nordstrom brand dress shirt
donated to the thrift store during the last two years had been returned to
Nordstrom stores for cash by either the employee or one of her friends. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hopefully the manager would be sufficiently
grateful to the bureau for cracking the case that he'd forgive us for calling
him after ten o'clock at night. Walker made the call on his cell to leave the
Easterbrooks' line open, just in case. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it turned out, the Easterbrook phone rang
just a few minutes later. I found myself watching Townsend to see how he
responded. Did he really expect the caller to be Clarissa? Or did he act like a
man who already knew we wouldn't be hearing from her? So far he seemed legit, if
dazed. He hadn't made any of the obvious slipups, the ones you see on <i>Court TV</i>.
Using the past tense, buying diamonds for another woman, selling the wife's
stuff, things like that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whoever was calling, it wasn't Clarissa.
Listening to one side of the conversation was frustrating. &quot;I see . . . Where
was he? . . . No, in fact, she's . . . missing.&quot; -- Townsend's voice cracked on
that one. &quot;The police are here now . . . Yes, that's terribly kind of you, if
you don't mind.&quot; Some more earnest thank-yous and a goodbye, and Townsend set
the phone back on its base. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;That was a fellow who lives a few streets down.
He works with me at the hospital. He and his wife were leaving the Chart House
and found a dog running in the parking lot with its leash on. It's Griffey.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Walker had reached </b>the Nordstrom manager, who
generously offered to meet him at the store to track down what Clarissa
Easterbrook had purchased yesterday and was -- we hoped -- still wearing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">About fifteen minutes after Walker left, a voice
similar to the one that announces my e-mails at home declared, &quot;Good evening.
You have a visitor.&quot; Ray was right. Creepy George Jetson house. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I looked out the living room window to see a man
in his fifties struggling to keep up with an excited yellow Lab dashing up the
slope to the front door, straining against the leash. A woman of roughly the
same age followed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Easterbrook opened the door, the Lab
finally pulled free from his temporary handler, dragging his leash behind him.
He leaped on Easterbrook's chest, nearly knocking him over. He was a sticky mess
from the drizzle, but you could tell he was a well-cared-for dog. Townsend
absently convinced Griffey to lie down by the fountain, though the panting and
tail thumping revealed that he was still excited to be home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A dog like Griffey probably had an advanced
degree from obedience school, unlike my dropout, Vinnie. Vinnie was actually
expelled. Or, more accurately, I was. When it became clear to the teacher that,
despite her instructions, I caved to Vinnie's every demand to avoid his
strategic peeing episodes, she suggested that I re-enroll my French bulldog when
I felt more committed to the process. Two years later, Vinnie and I have come to
mutually agreeable terms. He has a doggie door to the backyard, an automatic
feeder, and a rubber Gumby doll that he treats like his baby, but if I don't
come home in time to cuddle him and hear about his day, there's hell to pay.
Griffey, on the other hand, appeared to do whatever Easterbrook told him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Easterbrook introduced Griffey's new friends as
Dr. and Mrs. Jonathon Fletcher. I guess you have to give up both your first and
last names when you marry a physician. Dr. Fletcher's looks said <i>doctor</i> more than
Townsend Easterbrook's. In contrast with the flashy Expedition and high-tech
house, I noticed that the Fletchers pulled up in a Volvo station wagon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mrs. Dr. Fletcher did her best to provide
comfort. &quot;I'm certain Clarissa's just fine, Townsend. A misunderstanding, is
all. We just have to find her, and that's that. Now, when's the last time you
saw her?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She made it sound like we were trying to track
down a lost set of keys. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This morning,&quot; Townsend said. &quot;She was still in
bed. I had back-to-back surgeries, and when I got home she was gone.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Well, dear, I'm surprised you even get a chance
to operate anymore. Jonathon tells me how busy you are, developing the new
transplant unit. Sounds like that's going extremely well.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apparently Mrs. Dr. Fletcher was so used to her
job as conversationalist to her husband's colleagues that she was slipping into
autopilot. Understandably, Townsend cut her off. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Who knows? Still so much to do,&quot; he said.
Translation: Who the fuck cares about the hospital right now? &quot;I didn't even
realize Griffey was gone until a couple of hours ago. When did you find him?&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Right around ten,&quot; Dr. Fletcher said. &quot;A group
of us were leaving our function at the Chart House, and this feisty fellow was
running around in the parking lot. Initially, everyone assumed he escaped from
one of the neighborhood yards or something. But then someone noticed he was
dragging a leash. Our friend went after him, figuring someone had lost hold of
him. When he checked the tag, what do you know? Our own Griffey Easterbrook.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Chart House sat just a couple of steep miles
down from the Easterbrook home. The elegant restaurant was locate on the
winding, wooded section of Taylor's Ferry Road that ran from the modest
Burlingame neighborhood in southwest Portland, up about two miles to OHSU, and
then back down again into downtown Portland. Spectacular views of the city made
the route one of the most popular spots in the area for walks, runs, and bike
rides. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was not, however, the safest place for a
woman alone at night. About a year earlier, two guys from the DAs office were
taking a run there after work. They heard what they thought was a couple goofing
around behind the bushes, a man wrestling his squealing wife or girlfriend to
the grass. Fortunately, the woman heard them talking as they ran past and
yelled, &quot;Help, I don't know him.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bad guy got away, but the ensuing publicity
had called the city's attention to the potential dangers of the area. It was no
longer common to find women alone on the path after dark. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Fletchers' discovery of Griffey there was
not a good sign. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson must've been thinking the same thing, because he
decided to revisit what I thought had been our mutual decision not to search the
Easterbrook/Jetson home. He pulled me aside while Townsend continued the
conversation with the Fletchers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I know we're playing it safe, but finding the
dog changes the picture. We need to go through the place now while he's still
playing victim. If we wait until a body shows, he might lawyer up.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I shook my head. &quot;I
still don't like it,&quot; I said. &quot;Look at him -- he's a basket case. Later on, his
state of mind might vitiate any consent we get from him. If, God forbid, her
body does surface, we can easily get a warrant, since this is her house. We
won't need to have probable cause against the husband.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;And what do we do about the fact that our
doctor can move whatever he wants and start dumping evidence the minute we're
out of here?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson's point was well taken, but it wasn't
enough to justify a thorough search this early in the case. Not only could
Townsend try to throw out the search down the road, we'd pretty much be killing
any chance we had of continued cooperation from him. In any event, if Townsend
was involved in his wife's disappearance, he certainly could have disposed of
any incriminating evidence before calling the police. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I explained my thinking to Johnson and proposed
a compromise. &quot;Why don't you offer to take a look around to make sure there's no
sign of a break-in? I don't have a problem with you doing a general
walk-through; I just don't want a detailed search yet. If you check for broken
windows and the like, we can at least look for the obvious and avoid any major
fuckups.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Okay with you if I ask him about it in front of
his buddies?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I gave a quick nod. If Townsend felt pressured
to consent to a search because his friends were around, so be it. Courts only
care about claims of involuntariness if the supposed coercion comes from law
enforcement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before Johnson walked away, I added, &quot;We should
also get people searching up on Taylor's Ferry. Hopefully, by the time the
department has a search plan together, Walker can tell us what she might have
been wearing.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Griffey perked up when Tara came down the
stairs, apparently satisfied that nothing helpful was going to come from
foraging through her sister's closet. I'd already been positively disposed
toward her based on her obvious concern for her sister, and I warmed to her even
more when she found the energy to get down on the floor with her sister's dog
and comfort him with a bear hug. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a few minutes spent on introductions to
the Fletchers and the inevitable words of comfort, Tara grew antsy again. &quot;Griffey,
up,&quot; she commanded, pointing him toward the stairs. &quot;Sorry, I can't sit still.
You mind if I throw him into the tub real quick, Town? He's a little crunchy,
and it'll give me something to do.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was clear that Tara's nervous energy was
grating on her brother-in-law; he seemed more at ease once she'd followed
Griffey to the second floor and he could turn his attention back to the
Fletchers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I keep expecting the phone to ring, but I'm not
sure exactly what kind of call it would be; maybe a ransom demand or something.
Obviously, I want it to be Clarissa explaining that this is all a
misunderstanding, that she went with a friend somewhere and forgot to leave a
note, and Griffey just happened to get out . . .&quot; He was just rambling. I didn't
point out that the leash suggested Griffey had not simply escaped from the yard,
but that someone had been walking him. Townsend would come to the realizations
in his own time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was beginning to think that a ransom demand
would be good news at this point. At least it might indicate that Clarissa was
alive. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This lifestyle of ours,&quot; Townsend said, looking
around. &quot;Why does any of it really matter? Maybe it just invites problems.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson used the moment as his in to ask
permission for the walk-through. Consistent with everything else about the man,
his transition was smooth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He started by asking Dr. Easterbrook if he'd
ever noticed anything that might suggest that someone was scoping out the house
or following them, perhaps planning a way to get to Clarissa by herself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No, nothing at all like that,&quot; Easterbrook
replied. &quot;This neighborhood is so isolated up here. We hardly see anyone on our
street who doesn't live here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Can you think of anyone who has a conflict with
you of some kind? Someone who might be motivated to do something to scare you or
retaliate against you?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Why would someone hurt Clarissa to get to
<i>me</i>, detective?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Just exploring all possibilities, doctor. Maybe
a disgruntled patient from the hospital? A former employee?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No, &quot; Townsend said, slowly shaking his head.
&quot;Clarissa would occasionally get some threats about her cases, but she always
assumed they were only blowing off steam. Never anything we considered
seriously. No one would want to hurt her. She's such a good person.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I was just exploring all the possibilities,&quot;
Johnson repeated. &quot;Come to think of it, we should probably take a look around
and make sure there's no signs of a break-in, just in case. Do you mind?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Of course not, but I'm sure I would have
noticed something earlier. Given the security system, I don't see how anyone
could have gotten in.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;As long as you don't mind, I'll go ahead and
check it out. No harm, right?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson sidled off before anyone might want to
stop him, and the Fletchers seized the opportunity to extricate themselves from
a situation where they knew they couldn't be of much help. As they launched into
their goodbyes, feeding Townsend more premature assurances that everything would
be okay, I caught up with Ray. Truth was, I didn't want to be alone with
Townsend, struggling like the Fletchers to avoid all those lame clich�s -- this will all work out, only a silly misunderstanding, and
other completely useless pronouncements suggesting the speaker had any clue as
to how the night would end. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We hit the basement first. My basement is a
dark, damp, dusty wreck of concrete and cinder block that my imagination has
populated with thousands of spiders and their cobwebs. The Easterbrooks' had
been finished into a laundry room and a home gym that had better equipment than
my health club. Not only did we not fine any bodies, blood, or guts, there
weren't even any windows to check. In place of the flimsy things that are so
often kicked in for basement break-ins, the Easterbrooks had glass bricks.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Climbing back up the stairs, we could hear
Townsend letting the Fletchers out the front door, so we headed up to the second
floor, where Tara had Griffey in a bathroom off the main hallway. She was
fighting to get a dog brush through the hair on his hind leg. Predictably,
Griffey stood compliantly while Tara tried to avoid pulling his entire coat off
by the roots. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She looked up at us from the tile floor,
removing her hand from the brush to push her bangs from her forehead. The brush
stayed
entangled in poor Griffey's coat. &quot;I was just wondering whether I should
show this to you. I thought he felt a little crusty downstairs when I was
petting him, but it looks like he's actually got something dried on his coat
back here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson knelt down and looked more closely at
the side of Griffey's hip. Then he reached into an interior pocket of his suit
jacket, removed a latex glove, and slipped it over his right hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Do you mind giving us a second, Ms. Carney?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tara seemed surprised by the request but left
the bathroom, closing the door behind her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Looks like clay or something,&quot; Johnson
explained, &quot;like he brushed up against it here on his side.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Shit. We should have gotten the crime lab over
here immediately when the Fletchers called.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was beginning to panic. Why the hell hadn't
Johnson been on top of this? &quot;Wasn't obvious,&quot; he said, responding to the
unspoken question. &quot;Until you're certain what you're dealing with, it's hard to
decide what kind of resources to put into it. Considering the small chance of
any evidence off the dog, plus the likelihood that we're dealing with a runaway
wife, and it's a tough call.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It made sense, but it didn't excuse the fact
that we nearly allowed Tara Carney to take what might be our best piece of
evidence so far and soak him in a bathtub. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnson flaked some of the beige paste from
Griffey's coat into an evidence bag, then marked it with his name and the date
using a Sharpie pen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shit. What else had we missed? &quot;I think we
should go ahead and get the crime lab out here and search around Taylor's Ferry.
Everything about this feels bad.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Your call,&quot; he said, pulling out his cell
phone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This new gig was going to take some getting used
to. </font>
