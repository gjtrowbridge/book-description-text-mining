<br />
WHO IS DAVID Webb?&quot;<br />
<br />
Moira Trevor, standing in front of his desk at Georgetown  University, asked the question so seriously that Jason Bourne felt  obliged to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange,&quot; he said, &quot;no one's ever asked me that before. David Webb  is a linguistics expert, a man with two children who are living happily  with their grandparents&quot; --- Marie's parents --- &quot;on a ranch in Canada.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moira frowned. &quot;Don't you miss them?&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;I miss them terribly,&quot; Bourne said, &quot;but the truth is they're far  better off where they are. What kind of life could I offer them? And  then there's the constant danger from my Bourne identity. Marie was  kidnapped and threatened in order to force me to do something I had no  intention of doing. I won't make that mistake again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But surely you see them from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As often as I can, but it's difficult. I can't afford to have anyone following me back to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My heart goes out to you,&quot; Moira said, meaning it. She smiled. &quot;I  must say it's odd seeing you here, on a university campus, behind a  desk.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Shall I buy you a pipe and a jacket with elbow  patches?&quot;<br />

<br />
Bourne smiled. &quot;I'm content here, Moira. Really I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm happy for you. Martin's death was difficult for both of us. My  anodyne is going back to work full-bore. Yours is obviously here, in a  new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An old life, really.&quot; Bourne looked around the office. &quot;Marie was  happiest when I was teaching, when she could count on me being home  every night in time to have dinner with her and the kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Moira asked. &quot;Were you happiest here?&quot;<br />

<br />
A cloud passed across Bourne's face. &quot;I was happy being with Marie.&quot;  He turned to her. &quot;I can't imagine being able to say that to anyone  else but you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rare compliment from you, Jason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are my compliments so rare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Martin, you're a master at keeping secrets,&quot; she said. &quot;But I have doubts about how healthy that is.&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm sure it's not healthy at all,&quot; Bourne said. &quot;But it's the life we chose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which.&quot; She sat down on a chair opposite him. &quot;I came  early for our dinner date to talk to you about a work situation, but  now, seeing how content you are here, I don't know whether to continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bourne recalled the first time he had seen her, a slim, shapely  figure in the mist, dark hair swirling about her face. She was standing  at the parapet in the Cloisters, overlooking the Hudson River. The two  of them had come there to say good-bye to their mutual friend Martin  Lindros, whom Bourne had valiantly tried to save, only to fail.<br />
<br />
Today Moira was dressed in a wool suit, a silk blouse open at the  throat. Her face was strong, with a prominent nose, deep brown eyes  wide apart, intelligent, curved slightly at their outer corners. Her  hair fell to her shoulders in luxuriant waves. There was an uncommon  serenity about her, a woman who knew what she was about, who wouldn't  be intimidated or bullied by anyone, woman or man.<br />

<br />
Perhaps this last was what Bourne liked best about her. In that,  though in no other way, she was like Marie. He had never pried into her  relationship with Martin, but he assumed it had been romantic, since  Martin had given Bourne standing orders to send her a dozen red roses  should he ever die. This Bourne had done, with a sadness whose depth  surprised even him.<br />
<br />
Settled in her chair, one long, shapely leg crossed over her knee,  she looked the model of a European businesswoman. She had told him that  she was half French, half English, but her genes still carried the  imprint of ancient Venetian and Turkish ancestors. She was proud of the  fire in her mixed blood, the result of wars, invasions, fierce love.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on.&quot; He leaned forward, elbows on his desk. &quot;I want to hear what you have to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;All right. As I've told you, NextGen Energy Solutions  has completed our new liquid natural gas terminal in Long Beach. Our  first shipment is due in two weeks. I had this idea, which now seems  utterly crazy, but here goes. I'd like you to head up the security  procedures. My bosses are worried the terminal would make an awfully  tempting target for any terrorist group, and I agree. Frankly, I can't  think of anyone who'd make it more secure than you.&quot;<br />
<br />

&quot;I'm flattered, Moira. But I have obligations here. As you know,  Professor Specter has installed me as the head of the Comparative  Linguistics Department. I don't want to disappoint him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like Dominic Specter, Jason, really I do. You've made it clear  that he's your mentor. Actually, he's David Webb's mentor, right? But  it's Jason Bourne I first met, it feels like it's Jason Bourne I've  been coming to know these last few months. Who is Jason Bourne's  mentor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bourne's face darkened, as it had at the mention of Marie. &quot;Alex Conklin's dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moira shifted in her chair. &quot;If you come work with me there's no  baggage attached to it. Think about it. It's a chance to leave your  past lives behind --- both David Webb's and Jason Bourne's. I'm flying to  Munich shortly because a key element of the terminal is being  manufactured there. I need an expert opinion on it when I check the  specs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moira, there are any number of experts you can use.&quot;<br />
<br />

&quot;But none whose opinion I trust as much as yours. This is crucial  stuff, Jason. More than half the goods shipped into the United States  come through the port at Long Beach, so our security measures have to  be something special. The US government has already shown it has  neither the time nor the inclination to secure commercial traffic, so  we're forced to police it ourselves. The danger to this terminal is  real and it's serious. I know how expert you are at bypassing even the  most arcane security systems. You're the perfect candidate to put  nonconventional measures into place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bourne stood. &quot;Moira, listen to me. Marie was David Webb's biggest  cheerleader. Since her death, I've let go of him completely. But he's  not dead, he's not an invalid. He lives on inside me. When I fall  asleep I dream of his life as if it was someone else's, and I wake up  in a sweat. I feel as if a part of me has been sliced off. I don't want  to feel that way anymore. It's time to give David Webb his due.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Veronica Hart's step was light and  virtually carefree as she was admitted past checkpoint after checkpoint  on her way into the bunker that was the West Wing of the White House.  The job she was about to be handed --- director of Central Intelligence --- was  a formidable one, especially in the aftermath of last year's twin  debacles of murder and gross breach of security. Nevertheless, she had  never been happier. Having a sense of purpose was vital to her; being  singled out for daunting responsibility was the ultimate validation of  all the arduous work, setbacks, and threats she'd had to endure because  of her gender.<br />
<br />
There was also the matter of her age. At forty-six she was the  youngest DCI in recent memory. Being the youngest at something was  nothing new to her. Her astonishing intelligence combined with her  fierce determination to ensure that she was the youngest to graduate  from her college, youngest to be appointed to military intelligence, to  central army command, to a highly lucrative Black River private  intelligence position in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa where, to  this day, not even the heads of the seven directorates within CI knew  precisely where she had been posted, whom she commanded, or what her  mission had been.<br />
<br />
Now, at last, she was steps away from the apex, the top of the  intelligence heap. She'd successfully leapt all the hurdles,  sidestepped every trap, negotiated every maze, learned who to befriend  and who to show her back to. She had endured relentless sexual  innuendo, rumors of conduct unbecoming, stories of her reliance on her  male inferiors who supposedly did her thinking for her. In each case  she had triumphed, emphatically putting a stake through the heart of  the lies and, in some instances, taking down their instigators.<br />

<br />
She was, at this stage of her life, a force to be reckoned with, a  fact in which she justifiably reveled. So it was with a light heart  that she approached her meeting with the president. In her briefcase  was a thick file detailing the changes she proposed to make in CI to  clean up the unholy mess left behind by Karim al-Jamil and the  subsequent murder of her predecessor. Not surprisingly, CI was in total  disarray, morale had never been lower, and of course there was  resentment across the board from the all-male directorate heads, each  of whom felt he should have been elevated to DCI.<br />
<br />
The chaos and low morale were about to change, and she had a raft of  initiatives to ensure it. She was absolutely certain that the president  would be delighted not only with her plans but also with the speed with  which she would implement them. An intelligence organization as  important and vital as CI could not long endure the despair into which  it had sunk. Only the anti-terrorist black ops, Typhon, brainchild of  Martin Lindros, was running normally, and for that she had its new  director, Soraya Moore, to thank. Soraya's assumption of command had  been seamless. Her operatives loved her, would follow her into the  fires of Hades should she ask it of them. As for the rest of CI, it was  for herself to heal, energize, and give a refocused sense of purpose.<br />
<br />
She was surprised --- perhaps <em>shocked</em> wasn't too strong a  word --- to find the Oval Office occupied not only by the president but  also by Luther LaValle, the Pentagon's intelligence czar, and his  deputy, General Richard P. Kendall. Ignoring the others, she walked  across the plush American blue carpet to shake the president's hand.  She was tall, longnecked, and slender. Her ash-blond hair was cut in a  stylish fashion that fell short of being masculine but lent her a  business-like air. She wore a midnight-blue suit, low-heeled pumps,  small gold earrings, and a minimum of makeup. Her nails were cut square  across.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please have a seat, Veronica,&quot; the president said. &quot;You know Luther LaValle and General Kendall.&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Veronica inclined her head fractionally. &quot;Gentlemen, a  pleasure to see you.&quot; Though nothing could be farther from the truth.<br />
<br />
She hated LaValle. In many ways he was the most dangerous man in  American intelligence, not the least because he was backed by the  immensely powerful E. R. &quot;Bud&quot; Halliday, the secretary of defense.  LaValle was a power-hungry egotist who believed that he and his people  should be running American intelligence, period. He fed on war the way  other people fed on meat and potatoes. And though she had never been  able to prove it, she suspected that he was behind several of the more  lurid rumors that had circulated about her. He enjoyed ruining other  people's reputations, savored standing impudently on the skulls of his  enemies.<br />
<br />
Ever since Afghanistan and, subsequently, Iraq, LaValle had seized  the initiative --- under the typically wide-ranging and murky Pentagon  rubric of &quot;preparing the battlefield&quot; for the troops to come --- to expand  the purview of the Pentagon's intelligence-gathering initiatives until  now they encroached uncomfortably on those of CI. It was an open secret  within American intelligence circles that he coveted CI's operatives  and its long-established international networks. Now, with the Old Man  and his anointed successor dead, it would fit LaValle's MO to try to  make a land grab in the most aggressive manner possible. This was why  his presence and that of his lapdog set off the most serious warning  bells inside Veronica's mind.<br />

<br />
There were three chairs ranged in a rough semicircle in front of the  president's desk. Two of them were, of course, filled. Veronica took  the third chair, acutely aware that she was flanked by the two men,  doubtless by design. She laughed inwardly. If these two thought to  intimidate her by making her feel surrounded, they were sorely  mistaken. But then as the president began to talk she hoped to God her  laugh wouldn't echo hollowly in her mind an hour from now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dominic Specter hurried around the  corner as Bourne was locking the door to his office. The deep frown  that creased his high forehead vanished the moment he saw Bourne.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, I'm so glad I caught you before you left!&quot; he said with  great enthusiasm. Then, turning his charm on Bourne's companion, he  added, &quot;And with the magnificent Moira, no less.&quot; As always the perfect  gentleman, he bowed to her in the Old World European fashion.<br />
<br />

He returned his attention to Bourne. He was a short man full of  unbridled energy despite his seventy-odd years. His head seemed  perfectly round, surmounted by a halo of hair that wound from ear to  ear. His eyes were dark and inquisitive, his skin a deep bronze. His  generous mouth made him look vaguely and amusingly like a frog about to  spring from one lily pad to another. &quot;A matter of some concern has come  up and I need your opinion.&quot; He smiled. &quot;I see that this evening is out  of the question. Would dinner tomorrow be inconvenient?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bourne discerned something behind Specter's smile that gave him  pause; something was troubling his old mentor. &quot;Why don't we meet for  breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you certain I'm not putting you out, David?&quot; But he couldn't hide the relief that flooded his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, breakfast is better for me,&quot; Bourne lied, to make things easier for Specter. &quot;Eight o'clock?&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;Splendid! I look forward to it.&quot; With a nod in Moira's direction he was off. <br />
<br />
&quot;A firecracker,&quot; Moira said. &quot;If only I'd had professors like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bourne looked at her. &quot;Your college years must've been hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;Not quite as bad as all that, but then I only had two years of it before I fled to Berlin.&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;If you'd had professors like Dominic Specter, your experience would  have been far different, believe me.&quot; They sidestepped several knots of  students gathered to gossip or to trade questions about their last  classes.<br />
<br />
They strode along the corridor, out the doors, descended the steps  to the quad. He and Moira walked briskly across campus in the direction  of the restaurant where they would have dinner. Students streamed past  them, hurrying down the paths between trees and lawns. Somewhere a band  was playing in the stolid, almost plodding rhythm endemic to colleges  and universities. The sky was steeped in clouds, scudding overhead like  clipper ships on the high seas. A dank winter wind came streaming in  off the Potomac.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a time when I was plunged deep in depression. I knew it  but I wouldn't accept it --- you know what I mean. Professor Specter was  the one who connected with me, who was able to crack the shell I was  using to protect myself. To this day I have no idea how he did it or  even why he persevered. He said he saw something of himself in me. In  any event, he wanted to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
They passed the ivy-covered building where Specter, who was now the  president of the School of International Studies at Georgetown, had his  office. Men in tweed coats and corduroy jackets passed in and out of  the doors, frowns of deep concentration on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Specter gave me a job teaching linguistics. It was like a  life preserver to a drowning man. What I needed most then was a sense  of order and stability. I honestly don't know what would have happened  to me if not for him. He alone understood that immersing myself in  language makes me happy. No matter who I've been, the one constant is  my proficiency with languages. Learning languages is like learning  history from the inside out. It encompasses the battles of ethnicity,  religion, compromise, politics. So much can be learned from language  because it's been shaped by history.&quot;<br />

<br />
By this time they had left campus and were walking down 36th Street,  NW, toward 1789, a favorite restaurant of Moira's, which was housed in  a Federal town house. When they arrived, they were shown to a window  table on the second floor in a dim, paneled, old-fashioned room with  candles burning brightly on tables set with fine china and sparkling  stemware. They sat down facing each other and ordered drinks.<br />
<br />
Bourne leaned across the table, said in a low voice,&quot;Listen to me,  Moira, because I'm going to tell you something very few people know.  The Bourne identity continues to haunt me. Marie used to worry that the  decisions I was forced to make, the actions I had to take as Jason  Bourne would eventually drain me of all feeling, that one day I'd come  back to her and David Webb would be gone for good. I can't let that  happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, you and I have spent quite a bit of time with each other  since we met to scatter Martin's ashes. I've never seen a hint that  you've lost any part of your humanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both sat back, silent as the waiter set the drinks in front of them,  handed them menus. As soon as he left, Bourne said, &quot;That's reassuring,  believe me. In the short time I've known you I've come to value your  opinions. You're not like anyone else I've ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moira took a sip of her drink, set it down, all without taking her  eyes from his. &quot;Thank you. Coming from you that's quite a compliment,  particularly because I know how special Marie was to you.&quot;<br />

<br />
Bourne stared down at his drink.<br />
<br />
Moira reached across the starched white linen for his hand. &quot;I'm sorry, now you're drifting away.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced at her hand over his but didn't pull away. When he looked  up, he said, &quot;I relied on her for many things. But I find now that  those things are slipping away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a bad thing, or a good thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just it,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br />

<br />
Moira saw the anguish in his face, and her heart went out to him. It  was only months ago that she'd seen him standing by the parapet in the  Cloisters. He was clutching the bronze urn holding Martin's ashes as if  he never wanted to let it go. She'd known then, even if Martin hadn't  told her, what they'd meant to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martin was your friend,&quot; she said now. &quot;You put yourself in  terrible jeopardy to save him. Don't tell me you didn't feel anything  for him. Besides, by your own admission, you're not Jason Bourne now.  You're David Webb.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled. &quot;You have me there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face clouded over. &quot;I want to ask you a question, but I don't know whether I have the right.&quot;<br />

<br />
At once, he responded to the seriousness of her expression. &quot;Of course you can ask, Moira. Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath, let it go. &quot;Jason, I know you've said that  you're content at the university, and if that's so, fine. But I also  know you blame yourself for not being able to save Martin. You must  understand, though, if you couldn't save him, no one could. You did  your best; he knew that, I'm sure. And now I find myself wondering if  you believe you failed him ---  that you're not up to being Jason Bourne  anymore. I wonder if you've ever considered the idea that you accepted  Professor Specter's offer at the university in order to turn away from  Jason Bourne's life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I've considered it.&quot; After Martin's death he'd once again  decided to turn his back on Jason Bourne's life, on the running, the  deaths, a river that seemed to have as many bodies as the Ganges.  Always, for him, memories lurked. The sad ones he remembered. The  others, the shadowed ones that filled the halls of his mind, seemed to  have shape until he neared them, when they flowed away like a tide at  ebb. And what was left behind were the bleached bones of all those he'd  killed or had been killed because of who he was. But he knew just as  surely that as long as he drew breath, the Bourne identity wouldn't die.<br />
<br />
