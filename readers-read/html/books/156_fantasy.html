              <p align="center"><b>Chapter 1</b></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Louis Wu</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Louis Wu woke</i></b> aflame with
new life, under a coffin lid. </p>
<p>Displays glowed above his eyes. Bone
composition, blood parameters, deep reflexes, urea and potassium and
zinc balance: he could identify most of these. The damage listed wasn't
great. Punctures and gouges; fatigue; torn ligaments and extensive
bruises; two ribs cracked; all relics of the battle with the Vampire
protector, Bram. All healed now. The 'doc would have rebuilt him cell
by cell. He'd felt dead and cooling when he climbed into the Intensive
Care Cavity. </p>
<p>Eighty-four days ago, the display said. </p>
<p>Sixty-seven Ringworld days. Almost a
falan; a falan was ten Ringworld rotations, seventy-five thirty-hour
days. Twenty or thirty days should have healed him! But he'd known he
was injured. What with all the general bruising from the battle with
Bram, he hadn't even noticed puncture wounds in his back. </p>
<p>He'd been under repair for twice that
long the first time he lay in this box. Then, his internal plumbing
systems had been leaking into each other, and he'd been eleven years
without the longevity complex called <i>boosterspice</i>. He'd been
dying, and <i>old</i>. </p>
<p>Testosterone was high, adrenalin high
and rising. </p>
<p>Louis pushed steadily up against the
lid of the 'doc. The lid wouldn't move faster, but his body craved <i>action</i>.
He slid out and dropped to a stone floor, cold beneath his bare feet. <i>Stone</i>? </p>
<p>He was naked. He stood in a vast
cavern. Where was <i>Needle</i>? </p>
<p>The interstellar spacecraft <i>Hot
Needle of Inquiry</i> had been embedded in cooled magma when last he
looked, and Carlos Wu's experimental nanotech repair system had been in
the crew quarters. Now its components sat within a nest of instruments
and cables on a floor of cooled lava. The 'doc had been partly pulled
apart. Everything was still running. </p>
<p>Hubristic, massive, awesome: this was a
protector's work. Tunesmith, the Ghoul protector, must have been
studying the 'doc while it healed Louis. </p>
<p>Nearby, <i>Hot Needle of Inquiry</i>
had been fileted like a finless fish. A slice of hull running almost
nose to tail had been cut away, exposing housing, cargo space, docking
for a Lander now destroyed, thruster plates, and the hyperdrive motor
housing. More than half of the ship's volume was tanks, and of course
they'd been drained. The rim of the cut had been lined with copper or
bronze, and cables in the metal led to instruments and a generator. </p>
<p>The cut section had been pulled aside
by massive machinery. The cut surface was rimmed in bronze laced with
cables. </p>
<p>The hyperdrive motor had run the length
of the ship. Now it was laid out on the lava, in a nest of instruments.
Tunesmith again? </p>
<p>Louis wandered over to look. </p>
<p>It had been repaired. </p>
<p>Louis had stranded the Hindmost in
Ringworld space by chopping the hyperdrive in half, twelve or thirteen
years ago. Dismounted, it looked otherwise ready to take <i>Needle</i>
between the stars at Quantum I speeds, three days to the light year. </p>
<p><i>I could go home</i>, Louis thought,
tasting the notion. </p>
<p><i>Where is everybody</i>? Louis looked
around him, feeling the adrenalin surge. He was starting to shiver with
cold. </p>
<p>He'd be almost two hundred and forty
years old by now, wouldn't he? Easy to lose track here. But the nano
machines in Carlos Wu's experimental 'doc had read his DNA and repaired
everything down through the cell nuclei. Louis had done this dance
before. His body thought it was just past puberty. </p>
<p><i>Keep it cool, boy. Nobody's
challenged you yet. </i></p>
<p><b><i>The spacecraft, the</i></b> hull section, the 'doc, machines to move
and repair these masses, and crude-looking instruments arrayed to study
them, all formed a tight cluster within vaster spaces. The cavern was
tremendous and nearly empty. Louis saw float plates like stacks of
poker chips, and beyond those a tilted tower of tremendous toroids that
ran through a gap in the floor right up to the roof. Cylinders lay near
the gap, caged within more of Tunesmith's machinery. They were bigger
than <i>Needle</i>, each a little different from the others. </p>
<p>He'd passed through this place once
before. Louis looked up, knowing what to expect. </p>
<p><i>Five or six miles up</i>, he
thought. The Map of Mars stood forty miles high. This level would be
near the roof. Louis could make out its contours. Think of it as the
back of a mask . . . the mask of a shield volcano the size of Ceres. </p>
<p><i>Needle</i> had smashed down through
the crater in Mons Olympus, into the repair center that underlay the
one-to-one scale Map of Mars. Teela Brown had trapped them there after
she turned protector. She had moved the ship eight hundred miles
through these corridors, then poured molten rock around them. They'd
used stepping disks -- the puppeteers' instant transport system -- to
reach Teela. For all these years since, the ship had been trapped. </p>
<p>Now Tunesmith had brought it back to
the workstation under Mons Olympus. </p>
<p>Louis knew Tunesmith, but not well.
Louis had set a trap for Tunesmith, the Night Person, the breeder, and
Tunesmith had become a protector. He'd watched Tunesmith fight Bram;
and that was about all he knew of Tunesmith the protector. Now
Tunesmith held Louis's life in his hands, and it was Louis's own doing. </p>
<p>He'd be smarter than Louis. Trying to
outguess a protector was . . . futz . . . was both silly and
inevitable. No human culture has ever stopped trying to outguess God. </p>
<p>So. <i>Needle</i> was an interstellar
spacecraft, if someone could remount the hyperdrive. That tremendous
tilted tower -- forty miles of it if it reached all the way to the
Repair Center floor -- was a linear accelerator, a launching system.
One day Tunesmith might need a spacecraft. Meanwhile he'd leave <i>Needle</i>
gutted, because Louis Wu and the Hindmost might otherwise use it to
run, and the protector couldn't have that. </p>
<p>Louis walked until <i>Needle</i>
loomed: a hundred-and-ten-foot diameter cylinder with a flattened
belly. Not much of the ship was missing. The hyperdrive, the 'doc, what
else? The crew housing was a cross section, its floor eighty feet up.
Under the floor, all of the kitchen and recycling systems were exposed. </p>
<p>If he could climb that high, he'd have
his breakfast, and clothing too. He didn't see any obvious route. Maybe
there was a stepping disk link? But he couldn't guess where Tunesmith
might place a stepping disk, or where it would lead. </p>
<p>The Hindmost's command deck was exposed
too. It was three stories tall, with lower ceilings than a Kzin would
need. Louis saw how he could climb up to the lowest floor. A protector
would have no trouble at all. </p>
<p>Louis shook his head. What must the
Hindmost be <i>thinking</i>?</p>
<p>Pierson's puppeteers held to a
million-year-old philosophy
based on cowardice. When the Hindmost built <i>Needle</i>, he had
isolated his command deck from any intruders, even from his own alien
crew. There were no doors at all, just stepping disks booby-trapped a
thousand ways. Now . . . the puppeteer must feel as naked as Louis. </p>
<p>Louis crouched beneath the edge of some
flat-topped mass, maybe the breathing-air system. Leapt, pulled up, and
kept climbing. The 'doc's repairs had left him thin, almost gaunt; he
wasn't lifting much weight. Fifty feet up, he hung by his fingers for a
moment. </p>
<p>This was the lowest floor of the
Hindmost's cabin, his most private area. There would be defenses.
Tunesmith might have turned them off . . . or not. </p>
<p>He pulled up and was in forbidden
space. </p>
<p><b><i>He saw the</i></b> Hindmost. Then
he saw his own droud sitting on a table. </p>
<p>The droud was the connector between any
wall socket and Louis Wu's brain. Louis had destroyed that . . . had
given it to Chmeee and watched the Kzin batter it to bits. </p>
<p>So, a replacement. Bait for Louis Wu,
the current addict, the wirehead. Louis's hand crept into the hair at
the back of his head, under the queue. Plug in the droud, let it
trickle electric current down into the pleasure center . . . where was
the socket? </p>
<p>Louis laughed wildly. It wasn't there!
The autodoc's nano machines had rebuilt his skull without a socket for
the droud! </p>
<p>Louis thought it over. Then he took the
droud. When confused, send a confusing message. </p>
<p>The Hindmost lay like a jeweled
footstool, his three legs and both heads tucked protectively beneath
his torso. Louis's lips curled. He stepped forward to sink his hand
into the jeweled mane and shake the puppeteer out of his funk. </p>
<p>"Touch nothing!" </p>
<p>Louis flinched violently. The voice was
a blast of contralto music, the Hindmost's voice with the sound turned
up, and it spoke Interworld. "Whatever you desire," it said, "instruct
me. Touch nothing." </p>
<p>The Hindmost's voice -- <i>Needle</i>'s
autopilot -- knew him, knew his language at least, and hadn't killed
him. Louis found his own voice. "Were you expecting me?" </p>
<p>"Yes. I give you limited freedom in
this place. Find a current source next to --" </p>
<p>"No. Breakfast," Louis said as his
belly suddenly screamed that it was empty, dying. "I need food." </p>
<p>"There is no kitchen for your kind
here." </p>
<p>A shallow ramp wound round the walls to
the upper floors. "I'll be back," Louis said. He walked, then ran up
the ramp. He eased around the wall above a drop of eighty feet -- not
difficult, just scary -- and was in crew quarters. </p>
<p>A pit showed where the 'doc had been
removed. Crew quarters were not otherwise changed. The plants were
still alive. Louis went to the kitchen wall and dialed cappuccino and a
fruit plate. He ate. He dressed, pants and blouse and a vest that was
all pockets, the droud bulging one of the pockets. He finished the
fruit, then dialed up an omelet, potatoes, another cappuccino, and a
waffle. </p>
<p>He thought while he ate. What <i>was</i>
his desire? </p>
<p>Wake the Hindmost? He needed the
Hindmost to tell him what was going on . . . but puppeteers were
manipulative and secretive, and the balance of power in the Repair
Center kept changing. Best learn more first. Get a little leverage
before he reached for the truth. </p>
<p>He dumped the breakfast dishes in the
recycler toilet. He climbed around the wall, carefully. "Hindmost's
Voice," he said. </p>
<p>"At your command. You need not risk a
fall. Here is a stepping-disk link," and a cursor arrowhead showed him
a spot on the floor of crew quarters. </p>
<p>"Show me the Meteor Defense Room." </p>
<p>"That term is unknown." A hologram
window popped up in the portside wall. "Is this the place you mean?" </p>
<p><b><i>Meteor Defense beneath</i></b>
the Map of Mars was a vast, dark space. All the stars in the universe
ran round an ellipsoidal wall thirty feet high, and the floor and
ceiling. Three long swinging booms ended in chairs equipped with lap
keyboards, and those stood black-on-black before the wall display. </p>
<p>Past the edge of the pop-up window,
under a glare of light, knobby bones had been laid out for study. This
was the oldest protector Louis knew of, and Louis had named him Cronus.
In the far shadows stood pillars with large plates on top, mechanical
mushrooms. Louis pointed into the window. "What are those?" </p>
<p>"Service stacks," the Hindmost's Voice
said, "each made from several float plates topped by a stepping disk." </p>
<p>Louis nodded. The Ringworld engineers
had left float plates all through the Repair Center. If you stacked
them, they'd lift more. Adding a stepping disk seemed an obvious
refinement . . . if you had them to spare. </p>
<p>Louis saw a boom swing across the
starscape. It ended in a knobby, angular shadow. </p>
<p>All protectors look something like
medieval armor. </p>
<p>The protector was watching a spray of
stars. His cameras would be mounted on the Ringworld itself, maybe on
the outside of the rim wall, looking away from the sun. He didn't seem
aware that he was being spied on. </p>
<p>Louis knew better than to expect
asteroids or worlds. Unknown engineers had cleared all that out of the
Ringworld system. This drift of moving lights would be spacecraft held
by several species. Now the view focused on a gauzy, fragile Outsider
ship; now on a glass needle, a General Products' #2 hull, tenant
unknown; now a crowbar-shaped ARM warship. </p>
<p>Tunesmith's concentration seemed total.
He zoomed on starscape occluded by a foggy lump, a proto-comet. Tiny
angular machines drifted around it, marked by blinking cursor circles.
A lance of light glared much brighter: some warship's fusion drive.
Here came another, zipping across the screen. No weapon fired. </p>
<p><i>The Fringe War is still cold</i>,
Louis thought. He'd wondered how long that could last. A formal truce
could not hold among so many different minds. </p>
<p>The protector's arms jittered above the
keyboard. </p>
<p>In the corner of Louis's eye, sunlight
glared down. Louis spun
around. </p>
<p>Above <i>Needle</i> the crater in Mons
Olympus was sliding open,
flooding the cavern with unfiltered light. </p>
<p>The linear accelerator roared; an arc
of lightning ran bottom
to top. </p>
<p>The crater began to close. </p>
<p>Louis turned back to the display.
Looking over Tunesmith's shoulder, he watched fusion light flare from
offscreen and dwindle to a bright point. Whatever Tunesmith had
launched was already too far to see. </p>
<p>Tunesmith had joined the Fringe War! </p>
<p>A protector could not be expected to do
nothing, even if the alternative was to bring war down on their heads.
Louis scowled. Bram the protector had been crazy, even if supremely
intelligent. Louis must eventually decide if&nbsp; Tunesmith was crazy
too, and what to do about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile this latest maneuver should
keep the protector busy. Now, how much freedom had Louis been allotted?
Louis said, "Hindmost's Voice, show me the locations of all stepping
disks." </p>
<p>The Hindmost's Voice popped up three
hundred and sixty degrees of Map Room. The Ringworld surrounded Louis,
a ring six hundred million miles around and a million miles wide,
banded in blue for day and black for night and broad fuzzy edges for
dusk and dawn. Winking orange cursor lights were displayed across its
face. Some were shaped like arrowheads. </p>
<p>This pattern had changed greatly since
Louis had last seen it. "How many?" </p>
<p>"Ninety-five stepping disks are now in
use. Two failed. Three were dropped into deep space and probes launched
through them. The fleets shot them down. Ten are held in reserve." </p>
<p>The Hindmost had stocked stepping disks
aboard
<i>Hot Needle of Inquiry</i>, but not a hundred and ten! "Is the
Hindmost building more stepping disks?" </p>
<p>"With his help Tunesmith has built a
stepping-disk factory. Work proceeds slowly." </p>
<p>The blinking orange lights that marked
stepping disks were thick along the near side of the Ringworld, the
Great Ocean arc. The far side looked sparse. Two blinking orange
arrowheads had nearly reached the edge of the Other Ocean. Others were
moving in that direction.</p>
<p>The Other Ocean was a diamond shape
sprawling across most of the width of the Ringworld, one hundred eighty
degrees around from the Great Ocean. Two such masses of water must
counterbalance each other. The Hindmost's crew had not explored the
Other Ocean. <i>High time</i>, Louis thought. </p>
<p>Most of the stepping disks were
clustered around the Great Ocean, and of those, most were in a tight
cluster that must be the Map of Mars. Louis pointed at one offshore
from Mars. "What is that?" </p>
<p>"That is <i>Hot Needle of Inquiry</i>'s
lander." </p>
<p>Teela the protector had blasted the
lander during their last
duel. "It's functional?" </p>
<p>"The stepping-disk link is functional." </p>
<p>"What about the lander?" </p>
<p>"Life support is marginal. Drive
systems and weaponry have
failed." </p>
<p>"Can some of these service stacks be
locked out of the
system?" </p>
<p>"That has been done." Lines spread
across the map to link the
blinking lights. Some had crossed-circle <i>verboten</i> marks on
them:
<i>closed</i>. The maze was complicated, and Louis didn't try to
understand
it. "My Master has override codes," the Voice said. </p>
<p>"May I have those?" </p>
<p>"No." </p>
<p>"Number these stepping-disk sites for
me. Then print out a
map." </p>
<p>As the Ringworld was vast, the scale
was extreme. His naked
eye would never get any detail out of it. When the map extruded,
he folded it and stuffed it in a pocket anyway. </p>
<p><b><i>He broke for</i></b> lunch and
came back. </p>
<p>He set two service stacks moving and
changed a number
of links. The Hindmost's Voice printed another map with his changes
added. He pocketed that too. Better keep both. Now, with luck, he'd
have avenues of travel unknown to Tunesmith. </p>
<p>Or it might be wasted effort. The
Hindmost, when he woke, could change it all back in a moment. </p>
<p>The Voice refused to make weapons. Of
course the kitchen in <i>Needle</i>'s crew quarters hadn't done that
either. </p>
<p>Tunesmith was still at the end of a
boom, still tracking whatever he'd launched. </p>
<p>"Where are the rest of us?" Louis asked
the Voice. </p>
<p>"Who do you seek?" </p>
<p>"Acolyte." </p>
<p>"I do not have that name --" </p>
<p>"The Kzin we shared this ship with.
Chmeee's child." </p>
<p>"I list that LE as --" blood-curdling
howl. Louis had to pry
his fingers loose from a table edge. "Rename him Acolyte?" </p>
<p>"Please." </p>
<p>The map was back, and a blinking point
next to Fist-of-God . . . a hundred thousand miles port-and-antispin
from Fist-of-God -- four times the circumference of the Earth -- and
twice
that far to spinward of the Map of Mars. The hugeness of the
Ringworld had to be learned over and over. The Voice said,
"Here we set Acolyte, with a service stack, thirty-one days ago.
He has since moved by eleven hundred miles." The point jumped
minutely. "Tunesmith has altered the setting for the stepping
disk. It sends to an observation point on the Map of Earth." </p>
<p>Home to Acolyte's father. "Has he used
it?" </p>
<p>"No." </p>
<p>"Where are the City Builders?" </p>
<p>"Do you mean the librarians?
Kawaresksenjajok and Fortaralisplyar
and three children were returned to their origin --" </p>
<p>"Good!" He'd meant to do that himself. </p>
<p>"To the library in the floating city. I
note your approval. Who
else shall I track?" </p>
<p>Who else had been his companions? Two
protectors. Bram
the Vampire protector was dead. Tunesmith was . . . still busy,
it seemed. In the Meteor Defense Room the protector's telescope
screen was following a receding point, the vehicle he'd
launched earlier. Its drive was off . . . flared brilliantly and
blinked off again. </p>
<p>That was a warship. Reaction motors
were still needed for
war; modern thrusters couldn't switch on and off as fast.</p>
<p>Louis asked, "Have you kept track of
Valavirgillin?" </p>
<p>The map jumped. "Here, near the
floating city and a local
center of Machine People culture." </p>
<p>Good, and she was well away from
vampires. They had
not met in twelve years. "<i>Why</i> did you track her, Hindmost's
Voice?" </p>
<p>"Orders." </p>
<p>Carefully, "Who do you take orders
from?" </p>
<p>"From you and Tunesmith and --" a blast
of orchestral chaos,
piercingly sweet. Louis recognized the Hindmost's true name.
"But all such may be countermanded by --" the Hindmost's name again. </p>
<p>"Is Tunesmith restricted from any
interesting levels of this ship?" </p>
<p>"Not currently." </p>
