         <P><I>Robert, a third-grader,
walks to school most days. His school is no more than a five-minute trek
from home, yet even when
               Robert leaves on time, he is often
thirty minutes late.</I></P>
      </UL>


      <UL>

<P><I>His classmates don&#8217;t like Robert very much. They say he&#8217;s
bossy and claim he&#8217;s always picking on them. Robert has problems

in the classroom as well. He spends the majority of his time under or near
his desk rather than sitting down and working.
               His
handwriting is sloppy, his work is messy, and his assignments are
frequently left unfinished. He&#8217;s constantly losing things

and can&#8217;t seem to keep up with the class when they are reading aloud.
And rarely does he have the right materials out to complete

a given task.</I></P>
      </UL>


      <UL>

<P><I>At home, Robert is equally disorganized. His parents say he is
extremely messy and has to be repeatedly reminded to complete

simple chores. In the neighborhood, Robert has few friends his own age.
When he plays with them, a fight typically ensues
               over
sharing, hurt feelings, and so forth. Consequently, Robert plays mostly
with children who are older or younger than he
               is.</I></P>

</UL>


      <P>Robert was recently diagnosed as having
Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD)&#8212;and he&#8217;s far
from alone. AD/HD is
         thought to affect some 3 percent to 5 percent
of today&#8217;s school-age children in the United States. And while this
disorder
         seems to have emerged from nowhere to become a near
epidemic over the last decade, it&#8217;s hardly new.
      </P>



      <P>In fact, AD/HD has been recognized since the early 1900s, and is
one of the most widely researched of all childhood disorders.
         Over
the years, however&#8212;and to reflect researchers&#8217; growing advances
in concept and theory about this disorder&#8212;AD/HD has assumed

many aliases.
      </P>


      <P>In the 1930s, for example,
children who exhibited AD/HD-like symptoms were described as having
&#8220;Minimal Brain Damage.&#8221; In
         the 1960s, that label
changed to &#8220;Minimal Brain Dysfunction&#8221; and was considered
relatively rare. By the 1970s, however, it
         was called
&#8220;Hyperkinesis,&#8221; and up to two hundred thousand children were
thought to have the disorder.
      </P>


      <P>In the late
1980s, the term Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD) was coined, and affected
children were categorized as having
         ADD with or without
hyperactivity. The current name, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder&#8212;or AD/HD&#8212;was first used in 1994.
      </P>



      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>What Is AD/HD?</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>The American Psychiatric Association
redefined AD/HD in 1994 to describe three subtypes:</P>



<P></P>

      <P>1.&nbsp;AD/HD Predominantly Inattentive. Jill,
eleven, fits this category. Though bright and intelligent, she has trouble
paying
         attention to details, and, as a result, tends to make
careless mistakes on classwork and homework. Her teachers often reprimand

Jill for gazing out the window instead of listening to directions. But Jill
can&#8217;t help it. A chirping bird outside distracts
         her from
the math problem in front of her.
      </P>



<P>2.&nbsp;AD/HD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive. Eight-year-old Sam
falls into this subtype. He&#8217;s always tapping his pencil,

squirming in his seat, or otherwise fidgeting in class. His teachers often
send notes home saying, &#8220;Sam can&#8217;t stay seated
         or
quiet and often blurts out answers instead of waiting to be called
on.&#8221; At home, when friends come over, Sam has trouble

waiting his turn while playing games, and he&#8217;s constantly
interrupting his mom when she&#8217;s on the phone.
      </P>



      <P>3.&nbsp;AD/HD Combined Type. A child who falls into this category
is inattentive as well as hyperactive and impulsive&#8212;like Robert,

whom you read about earlier. One of the reasons Robert is often late for
school&#8212;even when he leaves on time&#8212;is that he might

spot a frog along the way and decide to chase it for a while. Once he is in
school, his teacher calls out Robert&#8217;s name several
         times a
day because he is often under or near his desk rather than sitting down
working. Robert rarely finishes his assignments
         in the classroom,
because he can&#8217;t seem to pay attention long enough to complete them.
And when his class is reading aloud,
         he has trouble keeping up
with them, because his mind wanders. At home, his parents say Robert is a
whirlwind. He rarely sits
         still, even when eating. His parents
must also repeatedly remind him to do his chores and stay focused on his
homework.
      </P>

      <P></P>


      <P>People
used to think that AD/HD was the result of some type of brain damage, but
scientists now know that&#8217;s not true. Granted,
         the exact
causes of this disorder remain a mystery; nevertheless, cutting-edge
research using computerized imaging technology
         and other
sophisticated diagnostic tools is revealing fascinating clues to why some
youngsters&#8217; brains have a propensity to
         AD/HD, while others
do not.
      </P>


      <P>Scientific evidence suggests that
the level of neurological activity is quite different in certain parts of
the brain in individuals
         with AD/HD compared to those who do not
have the disorder. Differences have also been found in the size of various
parts of
         the brain. Furthermore, at least in some cases of AD/HD,
these central nervous system differences appear to have a hereditary

component. We will talk more about the causes of AD/HD in Chapter Three.

</P>


      <P>Some researchers have described AD/HD as an
inhibition disorder. That is, children are unable to put the brakes on
useless
         movements, can&#8217;t control their distractibility and
inattention, and can&#8217;t overcome their tendency to daydream. It is
this
         inhibition theory that puts AD/HD in a family with certain
other disorders, such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder,

and tics.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>What It&#8217;s Not</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>AD/HD
is a biological, <I>not</I> an emotional disorder, though it can cause its
victims to experience emotional problems at home, in school, and in social

settings. Neither is AD/HD a learning disability, although many children
with AD/HD also have learning disabilities. Nor is
         AD/HD caused by
poor parenting or inadequate teachers, although a disorganized home life
and school environment can make its
         symptoms worse.
      </P>



      <P>Some suspect diet as the culprit, but extensive research
offers proof positive that too much sugar, aspartame (brand name:

NutraSweet), food additives, food coloring, and food allergies do not cause
AD/HD, either. Nor does watching too much television
         or playing
too many computer or video games, although these may reflect an environment
that lacks good supervision and may
         nurture the development of
AD/HD-like characteristics in a child.
      </P>



<P>What is true is that many children with AD/HD also suffer from other
conditions, including depression, anxiety, enuresis (bedwetting),

and tics. And for the frustrated parent and the unhappy child, sorting out
which symptoms are biologically based, which are
         learned behavior,
which are controllable or not controllable, and which are severe enough to
interfere with the child&#8217;s success
         presents a significant
dilemma.
      </P>


      <P>Of course, not all youngsters
who misbehave, who have trouble paying attention in school, or who have
difficulty making friends
         have AD/HD. In fact, a host of physical,
emotional, and situational problems can masquerade as AD/HD. Which is why
it&#8217;s imperative
         that a child be properly diagnosed before
being treated.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Diagnosis</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>With no virus
or bacteria to look for, no X-rays to take or blood tests to administer,
how is a diagnosis for AD/HD made?
         Usually it involves input from
a team of professionals&#8212;and from the child&#8217;s parents.

</P>


      <P>First, a medical doctor performs a thorough
physical exam&#8212;which often includes neurological tests&#8212;to rule
out any physical
         causes (such as vision problems or hearing loss)
for the difficulties a child is experiencing. Many physical and medical
problems,
         such as thyroid dysfunction, may cause behavior that
mimics AD/HD. (See Chapter Two for other maladies that can masquerade

as AD/HD.)
      </P>


      <P>Once physical causes are ruled
out, a psychologist may beconsulted. She may begin by taking a
comprehensive history from the
         child&#8217;s parents and
consulting with the child&#8217;s teachers. In addition to asking questions
about a child&#8217;s level of achievement,
         as well as social and
emotional functioning, the psychologist looks for signs of family crises
(death, job loss, divorce,
         a recent move) that can trigger
behavior problems that can be mistaken for AD/HD.
      </P>



<P>Gathering input from teachers and other caregivers is equally essential,
as symptoms that appear only at school or at home
         may indicate
that the problem is not AD/HD, but something related to a specific
setting.
      </P>


      <P>Classroom and home behavior is
most often evaluated using checklists such as the ones shown on pages 7 and
8 for checklist. These checklists
         allow professionals to get a better idea of a
child&#8217;s typical behavior&#8212;particularly behavior that may not be
obvious from
         observation. Two different checklists are presented.
One lists problem behavior while the second states positive behavior.

There are many commonly used checklists for parents and teachers that
incorporate one or both of these formats.
      </P>


      <P>Naturally, documenting
a child&#8217;s behavior in different settings is an important part of the
diagnostic process. In fact, for
         a correct diagnosis to be made, a
child must exhibit symptoms in at least two different settings. Thus, the
psychologist will
         frequently observe a child at school as part of
the data-gathering process.
      </P>


      <P>So, what does
the psychologist look for in the school setting? A number of
characteristics that can support a diagnosis of
         AD/HD, as well as
ideas to help the child improve his or her performance in the classroom.
For example, the psychologist might
         note how a child&#8217;s seat
placement contributes to distractions and how it affects his ability to
copy material from the chalkboard
         or get assistance from another
child or the teaching staff. The psychologist will likely observe how much
time the child spends
         paying attention to assigned work versus the
amount of time spent daydreaming or working on other, unassigned tasks. She
might
         observe how the child gets along with his peers, as well as
the types of children he gets along with best&#8212;or worst.
      </P>



      <P>The psychologist will likely monitor how successful the
child is at paying attention to and completing independent work, and

compare that to his performance in class discussions or in small groups.
She will also note the frequency and intensity of
         the
child&#8217;s problem behavior&#8212;and how the teacher responds to the
child.
      </P>


      <P>The problem is that a child with
AD/HD may show different behavior in different settings, at different times
of day, with
         different people, and when different levels of
challenge are presented. Therefore, relying on the report of one observer
or
         formulating an impression of a child from an isolated
observation may offer only a narrow view of the child&#8217;s problem. For

a diagnosis to be accurate, it is important to compare and contrast a
child&#8217;s performance under a number of conditions and
         to
analyze observations from various individuals. For this reason, the
psychologist may observe a child several times, on
         different
days.
      </P>


      <P>Can the diagnostic process move
forward without the input of a psychologist? Yes, it can. But some
professional must take
         the lead in gathering information and
documentation to help the physician make a diagnosis and to help parents
and teachers
         respond to the child&#8217;s needs. The
parents&#8217; professional partner may be a private or school
psychologist, another mental health
         professional, a supportive
teacher or school administrator, or even a friend who has traveled the same
path.
      </P>


      <P>When evaluating a child for AD/HD,
professionals rely on a profile of characteristics that tend to
differentiate children
         who might have AD/HD from those who do not.
This profile is then compared with a list of criteria to make an official
diagnosis.
      </P>


      <P>Where do these criteria come
from? They are listed in a manual that is published and revised
periodically by the American
         Psychiatric Association.
Professionals use this manual to diagnose specific psychiatric and
psychological diseases and disorders,
         and in its most recent
edition&#8212;<I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#8212;IV
(DSM-IV)</I>&#8212;the three types of AD/HD we discussed earlier are
listed.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Defining AD/HD</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Here are
details of the three subtypes of AD/HD:</P>


      <DIV
ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>AD/HD Predominantly Inattentive</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>A diagnosis of this subtype of AD/HD requires
that at least six of the following symptoms have been present for at least
six
         months; they must interfere with normal functioning in social,
academic, and occupational skills; they must be present in
         at
least two different settings; and they must be inconsistent with the
child&#8217;s developmental level:
      </P>


      <P></P>


      <P>1.&nbsp;Often fails to give close attention to details or makes
careless mistakes in school work, work, or other activities.</P>



      <P>2.&nbsp;Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or
play activities.</P>


      <P>3.&nbsp;Often does not seem to
listen to what is being said to him or her.</P>



<P>4.&nbsp;Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to
finish school work, chores, or duties in the workplace (not
         due to
oppositional behavior or failure to understand directions).
      </P>



      <P>5.&nbsp;Often has difficulty organizing tasks and
activities.</P>


      <P>6.&nbsp;Often avoids, expresses
reluctance about, or has difficulty engaging in tasks that require
sustained mental effort, such
         as school work or homework.

</P>


      <P>7.&nbsp;Often loses things necessary for tasks
or activities (such as school assignments, pencils, books, tools, or
toys).</P>


      <P>8.&nbsp;Is often easily distracted by
extraneous stimuli.</P>


      <P>9.&nbsp;Often forgetful in
daily activities.</P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>AD/HD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive</B></P>
      </DIV>



      <P>What was once called ADD with hyperactivity has been
renamed AD/HD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. For a diagnosis

to be made of this condition, at least some of the following symptoms must
have been present before seven years of age; at
         least six of the
symptoms must have been present for at least six months; they must
interfere with normal functioning in academic,
         social, and
academic skills; they must appear in two or more settings; and they must be
inconsistent with the child&#8217;s developmental
         level:

</P>


      <P><I>Hyperactivity</I></P>



<P>1.&nbsp;Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat.</P>



      <P>2.&nbsp;Leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which
remaining seated is expected.</P>


      <P>3.&nbsp;Often runs
about or climbs excessively in situations where it is inappropriate (in
adolescents or adults, may be limited
         to subjective feelings of
restlessness).
      </P>


      <P>4.&nbsp;Often has
difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly.</P>



      <P>5.&nbsp;Is always &#8220;on the go&#8221; or acts as if
&#8220;driven by a motor.&#8221;</P>


      <P>6.&nbsp;Often
talks excessively.</P>


      <P><I>Impulsivity</I></P>



      <P>7.&nbsp;Often blurts out answers to questions before the
questions have been completed.</P>


      <P>8.&nbsp;Often has
difficulty waiting in lines or awaiting turn in games or group
situations.</P>


      <P>9.&nbsp;Often interrupts or intrudes
on others (for example, butts into others&#8217; conversations or
games).</P>

      </DIV>


      <P>Diagnosing this
mixed subtype of AD/HD requires that a child meet the criteria for both
inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive
         subtypes. Moreover, at least
some of the symptoms must have been present before seven years of age; they
must appear in at
         least two different settings (at school, at
home, in recreational or social settings); they must clearly impair social
and
         academic functioning; and they must not be due to other
specified developmental or psychiatric disorders.
      </P>



<P>If you are a parent, it is important that you be well-prepared in
providing documentation of your child&#8217;s behavior, that you

be able to describe his behavior and performance in various situations, and
that you consider other factors that may be causing
         your child to
perform as he does. Professionals will use the symptoms listed
above&#8212;together with other information from physical
         exams
and reports from teachers and observed behavior&#8212;to determine if your
child has AD/HD.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>What&#8217;s Normal, What&#8217;s Not</B></P>
      </DIV>



      <P>All children are overly active some of the time. Many also have
short attention spans and may act without thinking. Several

factors, however, distinguish youngsters with AD/HD from those who do not
have this problem.
      </P>


      <P>First, it&#8217;s true
that many of these behavior patterns are developmental in nature. In other
words, they appear in children
         at certain ages, but youngsters
typically outgrow them. In children with AD/HD, however, many such behavior
patterns persist.
         These youngsters either do not outgrow the
behavior or the behavior disappears for a while, then returns.
      </P>



      <P>Second, children with AD/HD often exhibit more such
behavior than do children without the disorder. During a typical
child&#8217;s
         early years, for example, the majority of parents
deal with a few of these behavior patterns. But parents of children with

AD/HD deal with far more such behavior and for a much longer period of
time.
      </P>


      <P>Finally, parents can usually
control a majority of undesirable behavior in children who do not have
AD/HD by using good behavior
         management strategies. Youngsters
with AD/HD, however, tend not to respond to most behavior management
strategies or show
         great inconsistency in their response. A harsh
reprimand, time-out, or restriction, for example, may be enough for most
children
         to be convinced to straighten up. But these approaches
are not likely to have long-lasting effects on a child with AD/HD.

</P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Describing the
Child with AD/HD</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Children with
AD/HD are not all the same. They may exhibit some characteristics
frequently and others less frequently or not
         at all. Yet, having a
clearer understanding of which behavior may be a consequence of AD/HD may
help parents to better understand
         their child and to be less
frustrated by their behavior. In a slight departure from the list of
specific symptoms presented
         earlier, consider these descriptions,
which characterize the kinds of behavior one most often sees in children
with AD/HD:
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Fidgets, Squirms, or Seems Restless</B></P>
      </DIV>



      <P>Children with AD/HD are often described as &#8220;always on the
move.&#8221; In the classroom, they are the toe tappers or the ones who

are constantly fiddling with other objects on or in their desks. They may
chew on their collar or gnaw pencils. At home, during
         mealtime,
they may toy with their silverware or food. Children with AD/HD also often
demonstrate new and creative ways of
         sitting in a chair: on their
legs, with legs propped up on a desk or table, or half-standing and
half-sitting.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Has Difficulty Remaining Seated</B></P>
      </DIV>



<P>Teachers report that children with AD/HD are frequently out of their
seats for a variety of reasons. They need a drink of
         water. They
need to sharpen a pencil. They need to go to the bathroom. In fact,
teachers agree that it&#8217;s not unusual to find
         a child with
AD/HD wandering around the classroom for no apparent reason.
      </P>



      <P>At home, a youngster with AD/HD usually eats on the go
because he has a difficult time remaining seated for an entire meal.

Homework time also suffers, because the child is unable to sit still long
enough to complete his assignments. And when it
         comes to enjoying
activities that require participants to sit for any length of
time&#8212;such as concerts, lectures, and church
         or synagogue
services&#8212;parents often resign themselves to the fact that they cannot
take their child along. If they do, they
         spend excessive amounts
of time reminding him to remain seated and stay quiet.
      </P>



      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Is Easily Distracted</B></P>

</DIV>


<P>Children with AD/HD lose their concentration very
easily if there are sounds or movements around them. Consequently, in
school
         they have difficulty focusing on independent seatwork if,
for example, a reading group nearby is making noise, the classroom

gerbil is exercising, or a child sitting next to them is wearing a watch
with a loud ticking noise. That&#8217;s because many youngsters

with AD/HD are simply unable to disregard distractions like these.

</P>


      <P>Homework becomes a chore, as well, when the
television or stereo is on in a nearby room, or when people are coming and
going
         near the homework area. Oddly enough, however, children with
AD/HD may appear freer from distraction when playing video games

or watching television. This is likely due to the multisensory nature
(sound, color, and constant action) of these activities.

Consequently the ability to pay attention to these activities is not
sufficient to rule out a diagnosis of AD/HD.
      </P>



<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Has Difficulty Waiting His
Turn</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Many children with AD/HD
can&#8217;t wait in line as well as other youngsters of the same age. Some
may try to force their way to
         the front of the line. Others fidget
or constantly touch other children or things while waiting their turn, or
they may gyrate
         or dance around in line.
      </P>



<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Blurts Out Answers</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>Children with AD/HD would make ideal quiz
show contestants, and they may excel at classroom drills where quick
answers are
         rewarded. But in a structured classroom setting, these
children often stand out as being impatient and uncooperative. Unable

to muster the self-discipline needed to hold back an answer until they are
called upon, children with AD/HD will call out
         an answer as soon
as they think they know it.
      </P>


      <P>Moreover, in
some instances, their comments may be totally unrelated to the specific
class activity or discussion. This probably
         occurs because of the
associations the child makes in response to a question. For example, the
question, &#8220;What is the capital
         of Montana?&#8221; may get
the child thinking of the family trip to Montana last year, the plane
landing in Helena (the capital),
         their horseback riding excursion
at Yellowstone, and the park ranger they stopped to talk to. When the child
answers, &#8220;the
         park ranger,&#8221; there is no way for the
teacher to know that the child&#8217;s reply springs from having the
answer, though her thoughts
         have speeded right past the
appropriate response.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Has Difficulty Following Directions</B></P>
      </DIV>



      <P>Children with AD/HD usually fare better when dealing with a
single set of instructions. In fact, many become totally lost
         when
they are given several instructions at one time. Say a parent tells a child
to put on her pajamas, brush her teeth, and
         come back for a
&#8220;goodnight kiss.&#8221; Five minutes later, the child is wandering
around aimlessly or engaged in her room playing
         with her CD
player, not having even begun to do what she was told. The same pattern
occurs in school. When students are given
         numerous directions for
several worksheets at a time, the child with AD/HD may either remember
instructions for the first
         worksheet but not remember others, or
remember instructions for the last worksheet. Consequently, these children
frequently
         appear to be out of touch with what is going on in the
classroom. They also have difficulty remembering what they are supposed

to do for homework or which books to take home. Even if they write down
assignments, the information may often be garbled
         or wrong.

</P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Has Difficulty
Sustaining Attention</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>A classic
sign of AD/HD is the number of incomplete papers the child brings home from
school. Children with AD/HD have difficulty
         completing
assignments, and the appearance of their papers is usually a good indicator
of the disorder. They may complete
         the first few problems on a
page, but the remainder of the page is blank. Or their papers will look as
if they rushed through
         the work in an attempt to get everything
finished without regard to quality or correctness.
      </P>



      <P>On the flip side, some children with AD/HD are so meticulous that
they may do their work over and over until it is perfect.
         But this
extra time devoted to perfection often prevents them from completing other
important tasks on their to-do list.
      </P>


      <DIV
ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Shifts from One Uncompleted Task to
Another</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Parents of youngsters
with AD/HD often describe their children as having difficulty playing by
themselves or as moving from
         one play activity to another without
devoting much attention to any of them. Teachers agree. They describe
students with AD/HD
         as very impulsive in learning centers and as
likely to discontinue working at a project before its completion.
Furthermore,
         these children often leave remnants of their
activities around their desk, the classroom, or the house.
      </P>



      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Plays Loudly</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>Even when warned to calm down, children with
AD/HD have a tough time maintaining a quiet state. They are also easily
aroused
         by other children. As a rule of thumb, the louder and
busier an environment is, the louder and busier the child will be. In

fact, many parents with just one child who live in a relatively quiet home
often have a difficult time believing that their
         child with AD/HD
is as busy and loud in the classroom as the teacher says he is. But after
further probing, these parents
         usually come up with similar
descriptions of how their child typically behaves with them outside the
home, such as at restaurants
         or at the mall.
      </P>



      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Talks Excessively</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>A child with AD/HD is often described as
being very talkative and asking questions that are repetitive or that make
little
         sense, &#8220;Like an out-of-control tape recorder that is
locked on playback at a faster speed than normal,&#8221; according to one
parent.
         Some parents may be quick to defend such behavior:
&#8220;She&#8217;s perky, just like her mom,&#8221; or, &#8220;He&#8217;s
all boy.&#8221; But when it interferes
         with a child&#8217;s
success and is combined with other symptoms of AD/HD, it is reason for
concern and action.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Interrupts or Intrudes on Others</B></P>
      </DIV>



<P>Parents often describe their children with AD/HD as interrupting them
constantly when they are on the telephone or when they
         are talking
to their spouses or friends. Efforts to stop this annoying behavior are
generally futile, they say&#8212;to the point
         that parent-child
shouting matches frequently ensue. Moreover, because of this tendency not
only to interfere with what others
         are saying but also to try to
impose their will on others, children with AD/HD are often unpopular in
groups.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Does Not Seem to Listen</B></P>
      </DIV>



<P>Because children with AD/HD have trouble focusing visually and
sustaining visual attention on an individual or an activity,

people often assume that the child is not listening. On the contrary, many
youngsters with AD/HD are still able to comprehend
         what is going
on around them. In fact, teachers and parents are often surprised that the
child is able to answer questions
         or repeat what has been said to
him. Children with severe AD/HD, however, may not absorb what is said. In
addition, many children
         with AD/HD may have a limited working
memory, so that they cannot retain verbal directions long enough to carry
them all out.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Loses or Forgets Things</B></P>
      </DIV>



<P>Children with more severe cases of AD/HD often are so poorly organized
that they never seem to know where papers, pencils,
         articles of
clothing, or other belongings were left. They often come home without the
books they need for homework, for example,
         or may not be able to
find a shoe they just had in their hand! Nor is it unusual for them to
forget to relay important written
         or verbal messages to their
parents from their teachers&#8212;or vice versa&#8212;or to spend hours
doing their homework, then lose their
         papers before school the
next day or forget to turn them in.

         <P><B>Engages in Physically Dangerous

      <P>Because youngsters
with AD/HD tend to be impulsive, they often act before thinking. For
instance, they might run out into
         a street after a ball without
looking, jump from heights without considering potential danger, or ride a
bicycle at breakneck
         speed without considering what is in front of
them.

      </DIV>


      <P>If your
child has AD/HD, you may find that homework goes much more quickly if you
sit with him while he does it. Left alone
         to complete his
homework&#8212;or classwork&#8212;a child with this disorder will more than
likely be up and down, fidget, daydream, stare
         out the window, and
not finish the work. Even sitting with your child may require constant
redirection and hours of dealing
         with inefficient work skills.
However, the fact that your child <I>can</I> do the work if you sit with

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Plays Better with Older or Younger Than
with Same-Age Children</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Parents
of children with AD/HD often worry about their child playing almost
exclusively with much younger or much older children.
         Actually,
there&#8217;s a good reason why this happens. Youngsters with AD/HD are
often bossy or pick on other children and, while
         they may get away
with bossing around younger children, same-age peers won&#8217;t put up
with such a demanding playmate. Older
         children also tend to be
more tolerant of this type of behavior, or the child with AD/HD may control
his behavior better among
         older children for fear of being
rejected and losing the status of being able to play with them. In any
case, the child is
         likely to be alienated from his peers and to
have more relationships with younger and older children.
      </P>



      <P>A child with AD/HD may also play successfully with just one
child. In group situations, however, conflicts are likely to occur.

That&#8217;s because in most social situations, children with AD/HD have
difficulty reading social cues. They simply don&#8217;t recognize

when others are sending nonverbal messages that say, &#8220;You&#8217;re
coming on too strong,&#8221; or, &#8220;Back off.&#8221;

      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Has Difficulty Copying Words

      </DIV>



<P>The process of transferring information requires looking, retaining in
working memory what was seen, then unloading that information
         onto
paper. This can be a difficult process for children with AD/HD, since
fleeting attention limits the amount of information
         that can be
stored in memory from a single glance. Even when information is stored, it
may be done in a faulty manner, or
         there may be errors (spelling
mistakes, reversing information, adding or deleting information) in
transferring the information
         from memory to paper. For youngsters
with AD/HD, transferring information accurately requires many more glances
at the source
         material, but these children are likely to tire of
this quickly and may very well just write down what they <I>think</I> they
saw.

      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Knows Material Well While Studying, Then Performs Poorly on a
Test</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>There are few situations
more frustrating to parents than when, the night before a test, their child
appears to know the material
         very well, yet the next day takes the
test and scores a 42. What went wrong? During studying, the child&#8217;s
attention is focused
         with the help of a parent. During a test,
however, many more distractions are present in the classroom, and the child
is on
         his own staying focused and recalling information. And often
he can&#8217;t. In addition, the test may take place as long as twenty

hours after the child has studied for it, so many distractions have
intervened since then.
      </P>


      <P>Spelling tests are
frequently an exception because a teacher typically calls out a word, then
waits for each child to finish
         writing it. For this reason, many
children with AD/HD perform better on spelling quizzes than they do on
other kinds of tests.
         Moreover, teachers often help children
organize the way they study spelling: writing the word several times on
Monday, alphabetizing
         them on Tuesday, using them in sentences on
Wednesday, and reviewing them on Thursday before the test on Friday.

</P>


      <P>Nevertheless, once children start to daydream
or become distracted in the midst of a spelling test, they have a hard
time
         regaining their place and often leave out many words or
don&#8217;t complete the last parts of the test.

Incentives</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>What often stymies
parents and teachers about children with AD/HD is the consistency of their
inconsistencies. For example,
         on one occasion, a child might work
quickly at cleaning up his room in order to go swimming with his friends.
In a similar
         situation at a different time, however, his parents
may find him in his room playing instead of cleaning up. And if asked,

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go swimming?&#8221; his face might light up
as if to say, &#8220;Why, of course! Why would you ask such a silly
question?&#8221;
         But he also would have to be reminded again about
what he needs to do before he can go swimming.
      </P>



<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
         <P><B>Shows Evidence of Poor
Self-Esteem</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>The way a child
feels about himself is reflected in the look on his face, his body
language, his motivation to participate
         in various activities, and
the things he says. Indeed, many children with AD/HD look sad and choose
not to participate in
         extracurricular activities. Often this is
related to feelings of inadequacy and fear of more failure. More
distressing to
         parents, however, is a child&#8217;s claims that he
is stupid, that nobody likes him, that he hates his parents, or that he&#8217;d rather
         be dead.
      </P>


      <P>An analysis
of these statements is complicated. The child who knows that he understands
his school work, but continues to
         make poor grades, thinks he is
stupid in spite of what others tell him. This is particularly true when he
sees other children
         getting better grades than he does, even when
he is sure that he knows more than they do. Similarly, if the children he
wants
         to play with reject him, his perception is that
&#8220;nobody&#8221; likes him, even when an adult assures him that he does
have close
         friends. From the child&#8217;s perspective, it&#8217;s
a pretty lousy life. And, if a child shuts down his engine in the early
grades
         due to lack of success, it is very difficult to get it
restarted again later.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Is Significantly More Active Than Children of the Same Age</B></P>

</DIV>


      <P>This characteristic identifies children with
the hyperactivity component of AD/HD. In young children, hyperactivity may
be
         manifested in constant movement from one place to another, only
a few hours of sleep at night, restless sleep, and an inability
         to
sit in one place for more than a few seconds. Hyperactivity tends to
decrease as a child approaches adolescence; however,
         it is
typically replaced by more subtle excess movements. As a child gets older,
for example, hyperactivity may be characterized
         more by excessive
fidgeting and restlessness. Furthermore, older children often learn to
compensate through internal controls,
         either as a consequence of
improved neurological organization or because of increased motivation due
to peer pressure or other
         social or tangible incentives.

         <P><B>Demonstrates
Poor Penmanship</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Penmanship is a
skill that requires a plan for what one wants to write, an understanding of
how to put that information on
         paper, and an ability to transfer
that plan to paper. Many children with AD/HD have a great deal of
difficulty mastering one
         or more of these steps. While formulating
a plan for what they want to write, for example, they may become distracted
and
         unable to maintain in memory the complete content of what they
want to put on paper. Or they may have missed the instructions

regarding how it is supposed to go down on paper. Finally, the attention
required to the details of putting something down
         on paper may be
so poor that neatness is compromised. Consequently, writing that may start
off looking good while attention
         is high can quickly deteriorate
as the child proceeds with the writing task. Letters may become less
legible, and the spacing,
         size, or positioning of the letters and
words may be poor. In short, the child may be able to concentrate on the
neatness
         or the content, but not both simultaneously.

         <P><B>Lies or Makes Up
Stories</B></P>
      </DIV>


      <P>Parents and teachers
often report utter frustration with children who have AD/HD because they
lie about obvious events. For
         example, the teacher may see a child
take an object from another child&#8217;s desk and put it in her desk. When
confronted, the
         child denies that she took it and tends to blame
someone else or shrug her shoulders. Many children with AD/HD will deny
that
         they have homework, that the teacher told them about a test,
or that they took something from school that did not belong to

them, for example. While this kind of behavior is characteristic of many
young children, appropriate consequences typically
         cause the
behavior to disappear. When the behavior persists in a child with AD/HD,
however, it is probably related to the
         child&#8217;s
impulsiveness. In other words, a youngster with AD/HD will act on an idea
that comes to mind without becoming conscious
         of it. For example,
he may see a nice pencil sharpener on another child&#8217;s desk and say to
himself, &#8220;I sure wish I had that
         pencil sharpener.&#8221;
The next thing the child knows, it is in his hand or on his desk, and he
never is aware of the process
         of taking it from the other
child&#8217;s desk!

      <P>It is this same lack
of conscious monitoring of behavior that causes children with AD/HD to
blurt out embarrassing and outrageous
         statements or to be reported
for having their hands all over other children. As a consequence of AD/HD,
the child does a poor
         job monitoring his own behavior and,
therefore, may be totally unaware of what he says or does in many
instances.
      </P>


      <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<P><B>Coexisting Conditions</B></P>
      </DIV>



<P>About two-thirds of children with AD/HD also exhibit one or more other
conditions. Many of these are worrisome to parents&#8212;and

rightfully so. Later in this book, however, we will talk about treatment
approaches for AD/HD as well as these coexisting
         conditions, which
should provide more optimism that good outcomes are possible with early
diagnosis and prevention.
      </P>


      <P>The most common
coexisting psychological conditions with AD/HD are: oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder
         (CD), learning disabilities,
mood disorders (including depression and bipolar disorder), anxiety
disorder, and tics.
      </P>


      <P>The child with ODD
argues with adults, blames others, refuses to follow rules, gets angry
easily, and frequently annoys others.
         ODD is found in about 40
percent of children with AD/HD.
      </P>


      <P>Conduct
disorders affect about one-quarter of children with AD/HD and are
characterized by behaviors usually associated with
         juvenile
delinquency: destroying property, lying and stealing, truancy, and hurting
people and animals. Because symptoms often
         worsen as the child
gets older, early identification and treatment is critical. The combination
of AD/HD and CD is particularly
         troublesome, in that children with
these untreated coexisting conditions have a very high risk of social and
emotional problems
         in later years. They also are twice as likely
to have reading problems than children who have only AD/HD.
      </P>



      <P>As many as half of children with AD/HD also have a
learning disability&#8212;usually defined as a significant difference
between
         two or more areas of achievement (such as reading, math,
or writing) or between an area of achievement and intelligence. The

problem is, it&#8217;s often difficult to determine whether this is a
separate problem or one directly related to AD/HD.
      </P>



      <P>Reading disabilities are usually the first to show up, with
delays usually occurring in the first and second grades. That&#8217;s

because unlike simple math skills&#8212;where children can use their
fingers or objects to solve problems&#8212;reading requires that
         a
child recognize letter symbols, learn their names and corresponding sounds,
and be able to retrieve and combine them on
         demand. Actually, the
foundation for learning to read begins to form well before a child enters
kindergarten. The typical
         child takes notice of shapes, letters,
and words and shows an early curiosity about them. The young child with
AD/HD, however,
         may not focus long enough to construct that solid
foundation of prereading skills.
      </P>


      <P>Math
difficulties, on the other hand, don&#8217;t usually surface until the
introduction of word problems and multiplication and
         division.
That&#8217;s because these skills require more complex mental calculations
and information retrieval than simple addition
         and subtraction,
which a child may have accomplished using his fingers, stroke marks, or
objects.
      </P>


      <P>Regardless of subject, only
after successful treatment to control the symptoms of AD/HD can one
determine if the child has
         a true learning disability or simply
has a learning problem related to the AD/HD.
      </P>



<P>Mood problems are common, as well, in children with AD/HD. Many of these
youngsters appear sad much of the time or show frequent
         and
dramatic swings in mood. Much like learning disabilities, depression may
also be a separate problem (it does tend to run
         in families), or
it could be related to the symptoms of AD/HD. For example, a child who is
bossy and impulsive is not likely
         to have many friends. And if
being a social outcast is accompanied by disappointing report cards,
conflicts at home, and low
         self-esteem, it&#8217;s easy for a
child to feel sad, rejected, and unsuccessful. As a result, he may say that
nobody likes him,
         or that he would rather be dead.
      </P>



      <P>As a child suffering from AD/HD or depression&#8212;or
both&#8212;gets older, he may be more and more reluctant to participate in
group
         activities. He may also have trouble sleeping or eating and
show little enthusiasm for activities he once enjoyed. Some teenagers

react to all this by adopting different styles of dress; others might
undertake body piercing or even begin cutting themselves.
      </P>



      <P>As many as one in five children with AD/HD also has
bipolar disorder. At younger ages, this disorder is characterized by rapid

mood changes with no clear reason. The child may act sad and irritable or
be combative and aggressive. Unlike adults, in whom
         cycles of
depression and mania can last for days or weeks, children cycle much more
rapidly. While mania can be very debilitating
         as a child gets
older, the combination of AD/HD and mania is particularly problematic and
can interfere with success in every
         aspect of life.
      </P>



      <P>About one in ten children with AD/HD also has an anxiety
disorder together with AD/HD. While most individuals experience some

anxiety and nervousness in particular situations, a child with an anxiety
disorder worries excessively, has many unwarranted
         fears, and
feels stressed out or tense much of the time. Some children experience
panic attacks, characterized by difficulty
         breathing, dizziness, a
pounding heart, sweating, and fearfulness. Not surprisingly, children with
anxiety disorders and AD/HD
         have more problems in school, at home,
and in the community than children who have only AD/HD.
      </P>



      <P>A small number of children with AD/HD also have tics or
Tourette&#8217;s syndrome. Tics are nonpurposeful movements&#8212;such as
neck
         stretching, eye scrunching, and lip licking&#8212;that occur
over and over, and that the child cannot control. Tourette&#8217;s
syndrome
         is a combination of tics and uncontrolled vocalization,
such as sniffing or throat clearing. Stress and fatigue may increase

the frequency of the tics.
      </P>


      <P>Some children
with AD/HD have obsessions and compulsions, as well. Obsessions are
persistent unpleasant thoughts or feelings
         that interfere with the
ability to function normally. Compulsions are ritualistic activities
children feel they must engage
         in before moving on to another
activity or continuing with what they were already doing. For example, some
youngsters may
         feel compelled to wash their hands repeatedly after
touching a certain object, are driven to follow a certain pattern of
behavior
         before leaving the house, or must place objects in a
particular order before feeling at ease. Others must have their food

arranged in a certain way on their plate, or they must eat foods in a
certain order.
      </P>


    <P>Some children with AD/HD may
have a very low tolerance for loud noises or other stimuli. For example,
their socks must fit
         a certain way, or they may be unable to wear
shirts with labels that rub against their skin &#8220;the wrong
way.&#8221;
      </P>


      <P>Many youngsters with AD/HD
are persistent bedwetters, a condition called enuresis. While only about 10
percent of children
         in the normal population continue to wet the
bed at night beyond the age of six, this problem tends to be
over-represented
         in the population of children with AD/HD.
Moreover, the most common behavior approaches used to curb
bedwetting&#8212;reducing fluid
         intake after dinner, having the
child empty his bladder before he goes to bed and again before his parents
turn in&#8212;yield little
         consistent success in children with
AD/HD. Even use of the popular bell and pad method is only moderately
successful for these
         youngsters and may only add to the stresses
the child and his family are experiencing. With this method, a special pad
is
         placed under the sheet. When it is wet by urine, a bell
connected to the pad rings. This awakens the child, who can then get

up and complete urinating in the toilet.
      </P>



<P>As mentioned earlier, many children with AD/HD also show signs of
depression that may be related to feelings of despair brought
         on
by inability to meet their own&#8212;or others&#8217;&#8212;expectations.
It is painful for parents to see their children so unhappy. It
         is
even more painful for the child to live a life characterized by feelings of
helplessness and hopelessness. That&#8217;s why careful
         diagnosis
of AD/HD is necessary. It can help determine if a child&#8217;s depression
has resulted from a specific event&#8212;such as
         a parental
divorce, death of a family member, or a serious fight with a best
friend&#8212;or from more global factors such as continual

underachievement as a result of symptoms of AD/HD.
      </P>



      <P>Lisa&#8217;s story is an excellent example. Lisa is a
fourth-grader who consistently makes A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s on her report
card and who
         rarely has her name put on the board for misbehaving.
Lisa is also a popular child with lots of friends. For the past week

or so, however, Lisa has made low D&#8217;s on the majority of her tests
and has failed to turn in her homework most mornings. Her
         name has
been put on the board at least twice every day for talking back to the
teacher, and on the playground she has been
         repeatedly reprimanded
for pushing and yelling at her friends.
      </P>



<P>Lisa&#8217;s teacher tried talking to her, but Lisa insisted that
nothing was wrong. When the teacher threatened to call Lisa&#8217;s

parents, the child became defiant. &#8220;Fine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care. They&#8217;re not home anyway!&#8221;
      </P>



      <P>When her teacher called Lisa&#8217;s parents to schedule a
conference, a baby-sitter reported that they were indeed out of town.

Lisa&#8217;s grandmother&#8212;with whom the child had been very
close&#8212;had just died, and Lisa&#8217;s parents had gone out of town
for two
         weeks to attend the funeral and to help take care of
Lisa&#8217;s grandfather.
      </P>


      <P>Once the
teacher approached Lisa about her grandmother&#8217;s death, Lisa burst
into tears and apologized for misbehaving and not
         doing her work.
The school counselor spent several hours with Lisa over the next few weeks
and Lisa soon returned to her old
         self.
      </P>

         <P><B>Summary</B></P>
      </DIV>



      <P>Children with AD/HD are a diverse group. They are affected by
biological, hereditary, and environmental factors that researchers

are still trying to unravel. Many children have problems beyond AD/HD, which may have further dramatic impact on their successful
         performance in
school, at home, and in the community&#8212;both in the near and long
term.
      </P>


      <P>It&#8217;s up to parents to be
alert to the first signs and symptoms of AD/HD&#8212;and experts agree
these may show up as early as infancy
         and toddlerhood in the form
of frequent temper tantrums, severe separation anxiety, constant refusals
to go to sleep, and
         other unruly behavior. Yet, sadly, studies
show that most youngsters go a full decade before they are properly
diagnosed with
         this treatable disorder.
      </P>



<P>Successful treatment of AD/HD requires that a team of professionals work
together, which can be overwhelming for parents.
         But the good news
is that early diagnosis, intervention, and treatment have been shown to
help these youngsters overcome their
         problems and achieve success
in all areas of their life.
