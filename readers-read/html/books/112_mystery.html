<P>I&#8217;LL TELL YOU THIS&#8212;even on the so-called mean streets of New York, where the only thing harder to get than a taxi in the rain is attention, we were managing to turn heads that grim, gray December afternoon.</P>

<P>If anything could tug at the coiled-steel heartstrings of the Big Apple&#8217;s residents, I guess the sight of my mobilized Bennett clan&#8212;Chrissy, three; Shawna, four; Trent, five; twins Fiona and Bridget, seven; Eddie, eight; Ricky, nine; Jane, ten; Brian, eleven; and Juliana, twelve&#8212;all dressed in their Sunday best and walking in size order behind me, could do the trick.</P>
<P>I suppose I should have felt some privilege in being granted the knowledge that the milk of human kindness hasn&#8217;t completely dried up in our jaded metropolis.</P>
<P>But at the time, the gentle nods and warm smiles we received from every McClaren stroller&#8211;pushing Yummie, construction worker, and hot dog vendor from the subway exit next to Bloomingdale&#8217;s all the way to First Avenue were completely lost on me.</P>
<P>I had a lot on my mind.</P>
<P>The only New Yorker who <I>didn&#8217;t</I> seem like he wanted to go on a cheek-pinching bender was the old man in the hospital gown who cupped his cigarette and wheeled his IV cart out of the way to let us into our destination&#8212;the main entrance of the terminal wing of the New York Hospital Cancer Center.</P>

<P>I guess he had a lot on his mind, too.</P>
<P>I don&#8217;t know where New York Hospital recruits its staff for the terminal cancer wing, but my guess is somebody in Human Resources hacks into St. Peter&#8217;s mainframe and swipes the saint list. The constancy of their compassion and the absolute decency with which they treated me and my family were truly awe-inspiring.</P>
<P>But as I passed forever-smiling Kevin at reception and angelic Sally Hitchens, the head of the Nursing Department, it took everything I had to raise my head and manage a weak nod back at them.</P>
<P>To say I wasn&#8217;t feeling very social would have been putting it mildly.</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh, look, Tom,&#8221; a middle-aged woman, clearly a <I>visitor,</I> said to her husband at the elevator. &#8220;A teacher brought some students in to sing Christmas carols. Isn&#8217;t that so nice? Merry Christmas, children!&#8221;</P>

<P>We get that a lot. I&#8217;m of Irish American extraction, but my kids&#8212;all adopted&#8212;run the gamut. Trent and Shawna are African American; Ricky and Julia, Hispanic; and Jane is Korean. My youngest&#8217;s favorite show is <I>The Magic School Bus.</I> When we brought home the DVD, she exclaimed, &#8220;Daddy, it&#8217;s a show about our family!&#8221;</P>
<P>Give me a fuzzy red wig and I&#8217;m a six-foot-two, two-hundred-pound Ms. Frizzle. I certainly don&#8217;t look like what I am&#8212;a senior detective with the NYPD Homicide Division, a troubleshooter, negotiator, whatever&#8217;s needed by whoever needs it.</P>

<P>&#8220;Do you boys and girls know &#8216;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&#8217;?&#8221; the woman who had latched on to us persisted. I was just about to sharply point out her ignorance when Brian, my oldest son, glanced at the smoke coming out of my ears and piped up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh, no, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;m sorry. We don&#8217;t. But we know &#8216;Jingle Bells.&#8217; &#8221;</P>
<P>All the way up to dreaded <I>Five,</I> my ten kids sang &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; with gusto, and as we piled out of the elevator, I could see a happy tear in the woman&#8217;s eye. She wasn&#8217;t here on vacation either, I realized, and my son had salvaged the situation better than a United Nations diplomat, certainly better than I ever could have.</P>

<P>I wanted to kiss his forehead, but eleven-year-old boys have killed over less, so I just gave him a manly pat on the back as we turned down a silent, white corridor.</P>
<P>Chrissy, with her arm around Shawna, her &#8220;best little pal&#8221; as she calls her, was into the second verse of &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#8221; as we passed the nurses&#8217; station. The little ones could have been life-size Precious Moments figurines in their dresses and pigtailed hair, thanks to the extreme makeover work of their older sisters, Juliana and Jane.</P>
<P>My kids are great. Amazing, really. Like everyone else lately, they had gone so far above and beyond that it was hard to believe sometimes.</P>
<P>I guess it just pissed me off that they had to.</P>
<P>At the end of the second hallway we turned, a woman, wearing a flowered dress over her ninety-pound frame and a Yankees cap over her hairless head, was sitting in a wheelchair at the open door of 513.</P>

<P>&#8220;MOM!&#8221; the kids yelled, and the thunder of twenty feet suddenly shattered the relative silence of the hospital hall.
