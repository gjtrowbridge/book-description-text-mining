<b>Excerpt from Chapter 1</b>
<BR><BR>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Law� and Murder: Michelle Thompson
and Jeanine Nicarico</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On February� 3, 1984, a young
woman named Michelle Thompson and a male friend, Rene Valentine, were forced
at gunpoint from the car�they'd just entered in a parking lot outside D.
Laney's, a nightclub in Gurnee, Illinois, north of Chicago. The gunman walked
Valentine a short distance, then shot him in the chest at point-blank range.
When the police arrived, Michelle Thompson was gone.�</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I was an Assistant United
States Attorney in Chicago at the time, and my oldest friend in the federal
prosecutor's office, Jeremy Margolis, helped direct the FBI's search for
Thompson. Initially, the case appeared to be an interstate kidnapping, which
is a federal matter. Within a few days, the crime proved to be one within
the province of state authorities: murder. Beaten, raped, and strangled,
Thompson's body was discovered in Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, Hector
Reuben Sanchez, an illiterate but ambitious factory worker and burglar, was
arrested, along with an accomplice, Warren Peters, Jr., who ultimately agreed
to testify against Sanchez.�</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Deeply enmeshed in the case by now, Jeremy
was appointed a special Assistant State's Attorney to help the local prosecutors
try Sanchez in state court in Lake County, Illinois. As Jeremy prepared for
trial, I spent hours listening to him describe Michelle Thompson's miserable
final night. After Sanchez raped Thompson on the floor of the family room
in his house, she escaped and dashed, still handcuffed and naked below the
waist, through the snow to the back door of a neighbor's, where she pleaded
for help. Sanchez found her there and later assuaged the neighbor by telling
him that Thompson was drunk and hysterical. The pathos of the neighbor's
account of the young woman being led away by Sanchez was heartbreaking. Michelle
Thompson had been abused now for several hours, and she offered no further
resistance. She was resigned to being tortured and degraded, and hoped only
to live -- a meager, abased wish that went unfulfilled. Back in his house,
Sanchez gagged Michelle Thompson with a strip of cloth, bent her over a washing
machine and sodomized her, then strangled her with a nylon strap and a coat
hanger. He finished the job by beating her head on the basement floor.�</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In pursuing the case, the FBI had discovered
that nine years earlier Sanchez had murdered his girlfriend, slashing her
throat and shooting her, then escaped prosecution by threatening the witnesses.
This time Jeremy and the Lake County State's Attorneys were determined that
there would be no repetitions. They were seeking the death penalty.�</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through Jeremy, I followed the progress of
the case closely. Late in the summer, he and Ray McKoski, then the First
Assistant State's Attorney in Lake County, proceeded to trial in Waukegan,
Illinois. When Sanchez was convicted and sentenced to death in September
1984, I relished their victory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That sideline experience remained my only
direct exposure to capital prosecutions until 1991, when I was asked to take
on the <i> pro bono </i> appeal of Alejandro Hernandez. By then I was in
private practice as a partner in the Chicago office of Sonnenschein Nath
and Rosenthal, a large national firm. I'd known of Hernandez for nearly a
decade by now as a co-defendant in what the press commonly referred to as
"The Case That Broke Chicago's Heart." On February 25, 1983, Patricia Nicarico,
who worked as a school secretary in Naperville, a suburb outside Chicago,
had returned home to discover that her front door had been kicked in and
that her ten-year-old daughter, Jeanine, was missing. Two days later, the
girl's body, blindfolded and otherwise clad only in a nightshirt, was found
in a nearby nature preserve. She had died as the result of repeated blows
to the head, administered only after she had been sexually assaulted in a
number of ways. More than forty law enforcement officers joined a multi-jurisdictional
task force organized to hunt down the killer, for whose capture a $10,000
reward was offered. By early 1984, the case had still not been solved, and
a heated primary campaign was under way for the job of State's Attorney in
DuPage County. A few days before the primary, on March 6, 1984, Alex Hernandez,
Rolando Cruz, and Stephen Buckley were indicted, even though six weeks earlier
the State's Attorney had said that there was insufficient evidence to indict
anyone.�</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Ryan won the election and became the
new DuPage County State's Attorney. (Ryan was elected Attorney General of
Illinois in 1994 and served until early 2003, after losing in the November
2002 election, when he was the Republican candidate for Governor.) Ryan's
new office took the case against the three defendants to trial in January
1985. The jury deadlocked on Buckley, but Hernandez and Cruz were both convicted
and sentenced to death. There was no physical evidence against either of them
-- no blood, semen, fingerprints, hair, fiber, or other forensic proof. The
state's case consisted solely of each man's statements, a contradictory maze
of mutual accusations and demonstrable falsehoods as testified to by various
informants and police officers. By the time the case reached me, seven years
after Hernandez and Cruz were first arrested, the Illinois Supreme Court,
in 1988, had reversed the original convictions and ordered separate retrials.
Cruz was convicted and sentenced to death again in April 1990. The jury hung
in Hernandez's second trial, but the state put him on trial for his life
a third time in May 1991. He was found guilty but sentenced to eighty years,
rather than to execution. When Hernandez's trial lawyers, Mike Metnick, Jeff
Urdangen, and Jane Raley, approached me, they made a straightforward pitch.
Their client was innocent. I didn't believe it. I knew how the system worked.
Convict an innocent man once? Not likely, but possible. Twice? Never. And
even if it were true, I couldn't envision convincing an appeals court to
overturn the conviction a second time. Illinois elects its state court judges,
and this was a celebrated child murder. The lawyers begged me to read the
brief that Larry Marshall, a renowned professor of criminal law at Northwestern
University, had filed in behalf of Cruz, and to look at the transcripts of
Hernandez's trials. By the time I had done this, six weeks later, I knew
I had to take the case or stop calling myself a lawyer. Alex Hernandez was
innocent.�</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In June 1985, a few months after Hernandez
and Cruz were first convicted, another little girl, Melissa Ackerman, age
seven, was abducted and murdered in LaSalle County, about an hour's drive
from Jeanine Nicarico's house. Both Melissa and Jeanine were kidnapped in
broad daylight, carried away in blankets, sodomized, and murdered in a wooded
area. A man named Brian Dugan was arrested for Melissa's murder. In the course
of complex plea discussions, his lawyer said that Dugan was prepared to plead
guilty not only to the Ackerman killing but to a host of other crimes, including
raping and killing two more females. One of the additional women Dugan was
prepared to admit he killed was a twenty-seven-year-old nurse named Donna
Schnorr. The other was Jeanine Nicarico.�The prosecutors from DuPage County
were contacted and invited to question Dugan, through his attorney. The First
Assistant, Robert Kilander, and a younger prosecutor met with Dugan's lawyer,
but after returning to their office, they refused to accept Dugan's statements
or to deal with him further. (Nor did anyone from the DuPage office inform
the lawyers for Cruz and Hernandez that another man was prepared to admit
to the murder for which their clients were then awaiting execution.)�</font></p>
