<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The
rush of water caught Gyalo full in the chest. It felt completely real; he
gasped and leaped aside before he could stop himself, brushing at his face
and clothes. Even as he did, he understood the trick, and straightened up
again, angry at himself for being taken in.<br>
<br>
He thought he could see the one who had done it: a skinny postulant
with the yellow headband of a trainee Shaper, leaning over the back of a
passing parade cart and grinning in Gyalo&#8217;s direction. Packed in around him,
other trainees tossed blessings to the crowd: a shower of spangles, streamers
of transparent gauze, a burst of rainbow brilliance. These were not true shapings,
which changed and shifted matter and properly could be performed only in
the context of &Acirc;ratist ceremony, but illusions, substanceless manipulations
of light and air: a symbolic reminder of the sacred power bestowed by the
god on humankind before time began. They vanished even as the spectators
laughed and snatched at them.<br>
<br>
The water had not been entirely illusory, though. Gyalo could feel
dampness on his cheeks, and the fine golden silk of his Shaper stole was
spotted with wet. Under other circumstances he might have seen the humor
in it--the people nearby clearly did, though in deference to his Shaperhood
they hid their smiles behind their hands--but he had spent time and care
dressing himself, and so he was not amused.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Here, Brother.&#8221; One of the bystanders, a young Arsacian woman, offered him her stole. &#8220;For your face.&#8221;<br>
<br>
She spoke shyly, but laughter twitched the corners of her mouth. Well, Gyalo thought, it <i>was</i> funny.
Ruefully, he smiled at her and took the stole.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Thanks for your charity, lady,&#8221; he said, giving it back into her
hands. &#8220;Hopefully I can manage to keep dry the rest of the way.&#8221;<br>
<br>
She giggled. &#8220;Great is &Acirc;rata,&#8221; she said, making the god&#8217;s sign. &#8220;Great is his Way.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Go in light.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo moved on. To his left the spectators were a mass of packed
bodies and laughing faces; to his right the procession trundled along, an
exuberant juggernaut of color, noise, and smell: ox-drawn parade carts festooned
with ribbons dyed in the god&#8217;s colors; groups of Forceless monks on foot, beating drums
and blowing kanshas, great trumpets that curved over the shoulder and made
a sound like a mythic beast dying in agony; drays bearing huge wood-and-gilt
statues of &Acirc;rata in his four guises of World-Creator, Primal Warrior,
Eon-Sleeper, and Risen Judge; litters with smaller images of some of &Acirc;rata&#8217;s
more powerful Aspects--D&acirc;darshi, Patron of luck, Skambys, Patron of
war and weather, Hat&acirc;spa, Patron of fire and weaponry, Tane, Patron
of crops and the moon--carried by hymn-singing devotee-priests. Between these
groups walked postulants with rods of burning incense, and more monks shouting
out rhythmically: &#8220;Wake, O &Acirc;rata, wake. Wake and deliver your children
from exile.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Like the blessings, the cacophony was symbolic: no one imagined that all
this noise could actually rouse the god. It was meant for the human spectators,
to remind them of the waiting that was their lot, that had been the lot of
every living creature since &Acirc;rata first lay down to sleep. It echoed
deafeningly back from the high blood granite walls that enclosed the avenue;
Gyalo&#8217;s ears rang from it, and his eyes burned from incense smoke. Another
day he might have ducked through one of the archways that gave access to
the tangled side streets, in search of a less crowded way to go. But though
he had long known Baushpar&#8217;s plan by heart, he had never actually set
foot in the holy city until six months earlier, and the map in his head did not always
guide him properly. He could not risk, today of all days, getting lost.<br>
<br>
Which reminded him, with unwelcome sharpness, that he was nervous.<br>
<br>
The avenue terminated upon a vast walled square paved in russet
ironstone, at whose center rose the monumental bulk of the First Temple of
&Acirc;rata. The Temple&#8217;s original core had been erected more than eleven
centuries before, but it had been expanded many times since then, in a score
or more of different styles and motifs lent harmony by the yellow honey granite
of which the whole was made. Images and carvings covered every inch of the
huge fa&ccedil;ade, worn to varying degrees of featurelessness by time and
weather, but here and there, where the construction was newer or there was
protection from the elements, showing sharper and more perfect. Above it
all a dozen domes reached toward the sky, like fat lotus buds about to open.
Recently re-gilded, they reflected light even on this overcast day; when
the sun shone, they were blinding.<br>
<br>
Gyalo had been raised on tales of the First Temple&#8217;s magnificence,
and it justified the stories in every respect, even marred by decades of
neglect and the more substantial depredations of the Caryaxists, who had
helped themselves to floor tiles and wall inlays and anything made of metal,
and scraped all the gold leaf off the image of &Acirc;rata Eon-Sleeper that reclined
at the Temple&#8217;s circular core. Still, the Temple was too huge, and--even for the Caryaxists--too
sacred to be razed or ruined, as other temples and shrines and monasteries
all over Arsace had been. It rested on the ironstone paving, a golden island
atop a russet sea, as colossal and serene as the dreaming god himself.<br>
<br>
Gyalo and the procession parted company--the procession moving left,
preparing to round the Temple, Gyalo turning right, toward the square&#8217;s western
side. The spectators made way for him, dipping their heads respectfully and
making the sign of &Acirc;rata as he passed. Elsewhere the square was thickly
populated by food vendors and offerings-sellers, but there were none here.
The western wall marked the boundary of the Evening City, a labyrinth of
courts and offices and suites that, from the first days of the church, had
been the seat of the &Acirc;ratist leadership. For the past eighty years it had
stood empty, for the Caryaxist rebellion had sent the Brethren into exile.
But the Caryaxists were gone now, and the Sons and Daughters had taken back
their home.<br>
<br>
The red gate at the wall&#8217;s midpoint was unlocked--meant not
to bar entry but to remind those who passed through it of the separateness
of the men and women who lived on its other side. It gave onto a long courtyard
paved in the same ironstone as the square. At the court&#8217;s far end, a pavilion
with a yellow-tiled roof marked the entrance to the Evening City.<br>
<br>
Four guards stood duty inside, clad in the white stoles of the Forceless
and displaying on their arms and cheeks the sinuous tattoos of ordinates
from the kingdom of Kanu-Tapa, where Skambys, Patron of war, was the most
important of the Aspects, and martial arts were part of &Acirc;ratist training.
Behind them rose two great sets of vermilion-painted doors. Those on the
left, which gave access to the offices where administrative work was done,
were open. Those on the right were closed. Beyond them lay the living quarters
of the Brethren, where no one went without permission.<br>
<br>
Gyalo approached the guards&#8217; leader. He came here daily, in his
capacity as aide to the Son Utamnos; the guards all knew him, a fact they
acknowledged now by ignoring him completely. This time, though, his purpose
was different.<br>
<br>
&#8220;I have a summons.&#8221; By custom, he spoke Arsacian, the common language of the church. &#8220;From the Bearer.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The leader&#8217;s bored, superior expression did not change. He took
the message cylinder Gyalo offered and scanned the paper inside. Turning,
he nodded to one of his subordinates, who disappeared through the right-hand
doors. The leader handed the summons back to Gyalo and withdrew his attention
again, as thoroughly as if Gyalo had ceased to exist.<br>
<br>
Under other circumstances Gyalo might have been annoyed at this
display of Tapati arrogance, but today he was too distracted. His apprehension
flowed through him like water. It was unexpected, this anxiety--not the feeling
itself, for given the identity of his summoner some degree of nervousness
was to be expected, but its acuteness. Had not Utamnos, warning him to expect
the summons, told him that its purpose would honor him? Yet Utamnos either
could not or would not reveal what the purpose was, giving him instead a
list of documents to read in preparation: accounts of the Caryaxist occupation,
descriptions of Thuxra City, the small body of writings on the Burning Land.
Over the past four days the mystery had become more and more oppressive.
Now, waiting in the pavilion with only the disdainful guards for company,
Gyalo felt nearly ill with accumulated stress.<br>
<br>
The guard returned, another Forceless monk behind him. The monk
scrutinized Gyalo&#8217;s summons and tucked it into a pocket of his gown.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said.<br>
<br>
He led the way through the doors on the right, into rooms and corridors
familiar to Gyalo from his visits to Utamnos&#8217;s private suite, and then into
regions Gyalo did not know. Everywhere was magnificence, both intact--astonishing
floor-mosaics, intricately carved columns and door-frames, gorgeously stenciled
ceilings, majestic galleries flanked by graveled courts--and marred--defaced
murals, derelict gardens, ruined atriums, shattered carvings. The Caryaxists
had been great graffitists, and the returning &Acirc;ratist leadership had
found much of the Evening City decorated with revolutionary slogans and lewd
cartoons. Despite the priority given to the removal of these, a few still
remained, ugly scrawlings in red paint like blood, yellow paint like bile:
&Acirc;rata&#8217;s colors, used to mock him.<br>
<br>
Gyalo&#8217;s guide delivered him at last into a large chamber with a
coffered ceiling and a floor of red tile. &#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he directed, and departed.<br>
<br>
Gyalo paced the length of the room, halting before the windows.
They faced onto a small garden--not overgrown, like many of those he had
just passed, but exquisitely restored, with clipped shrubs and carefully
raked gravel paths. The warm air smelled of roses. He closed his eyes and
breathed deeply, seeking calm. He was aware of the beating of his heart,
the ebb and flow of his apprehension.<br>
<br>
There were footsteps behind him. He turned. A man in white and crimson
clothes was passing through the doorway, followed by two Tapati guards and
a teenage boy. The man towered above all three of his companions; he moved
with the swift forceful stride of someone who assumed without considering
it that he would be made way for. Gyalo had seen this man many times--had
heard him speak many times, too, in rich tones that made all words beautiful--but
always from a distance, always surrounded by scores, even hundreds, of others.
He had never, at this point in his career, thought to stand solitary before
the Blood Bearer, incarnate Son of &Acirc;rata&#8217;s First Messenger and elected
leader of the &Acirc;ratist church.<br>
<br>
He came forward and sank to his knees on the cool tiles. He bowed
his head, crossing his hands before his face, and said, in a voice that shook
only a little:<br>
<br>
&#8220;Great is &Acirc;rata. Great is his Way.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Go in light,&#8221; the Bearer replied. &#8220;Get up.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo obeyed. The Bearer was about forty years of age, with broad
handsome features and heavy-lidded eyes. An intricate image of the sun, &Acirc;rata&#8217;s
symbol, was tattooed in red upon his forehead. He had the tawny skin and
heavy bone structure common in the kingdom of Haruko, where he had been born
in this incarnation; the great weight of muscle he carried was apparent in
his corded neck and wide shoulders and the round hard sinews of his right
arm, left bare by the traditional draping of his white stole. Like all vowed
&Acirc;ratists he kept his chin and skull clean-shaven, and wore the monk&#8217;s
uniform of loose trousers and knee-length sleeveless gown--though his were
made of lustrous red silk, rather than Gyalo&#8217;s plain linen or the coarse
cotton worn by the Forceless.<br>
<br>
On the Bearer&#8217;s chest rested the badge of his office, a thick gold
chain with a pendant cage of gold wire, inside which gleamed a honey-colored
jewel as large as a man&#8217;s clenched fist: the Blood of &Acirc;rata. The Blood
was round in shape and naturally faceted; a core of living flame seemed to
dance at its heart. All vowed &Acirc;ratists wore a smaller simulacrum of
this necklace, hidden beneath their clothing, but the most cleverly crafted
of these could only suggest the splendor of the original. If Gyalo had not
known what the jewel was, he would still have sensed its sacredness, in that
shuddering brilliance that was unlike anything else in the world--so much
more beautiful, and so much stranger, than was apparent from a distance.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Your master told you to expect this summons, yes?&#8221;<br>
<br>
With difficulty, Gyalo wrenched his attention away from the jewel. &#8220;Yes, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Your master holds you in high esteem.&#8221; The Bearer&#8217;s eyes moved
across Gyalo&#8217;s face, as if measuring him against that assessment. &#8220;He tells
me that he relies on you beyond any of his other aides.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo bowed his head. &#8220;His confidence honors me, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Come.&#8221; The Bearer turned and strode toward the chair his guards had brought forward
and placed at the center of the room. Gyalo followed, halting a little distance
away and arranging himself in a posture of respect, his eyes cast down and
his hands clasped before him. He was conscious of the guards at the Bearer&#8217;s
back, and of the boy, kneeling quietly on the floor at the Bearer&#8217;s feet.
The boy was also Haruko-born, paler of skin than the Bearer, but with the
same strong bones and heavy-lidded almond eyes. His black hair hung loose,
and he wore the plain white tunic and trousers of a postulant. But the sun
tattoo on his forehead, and of course his presence, marked him for what he
truly was: another incarnate Son, too young yet to take up the burdens of
leadership, but old enough to observe his elders in the performance of their
duties. Infant Sons and Daughters were given  to the adult Brethren to raise
as their own: this boy, Vimata, was both the Bearer&#8217;s spirit-brother and
his foster child.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Tell me about yourself,&#8221; the Bearer said. &#8220;Where were you born?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;In Rimpang, Old One.&#8221; Rimpang, capital of the kingdom of Chonggye,
was home to the largest &Acirc;ratist center in Galea after Baushpar; the
Brethren had taken refuge there upon their flight from the Caryaxist rebellion.
&#8220;My mother was a cook in one of the convents. She died when I was seven.
The nuns gave me to the monks to raise.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Had you no other family?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;My father. But he was a soldier, and stationed elsewhere. There were only the monks to take me in.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer shifted in his chair, crossing one leg over the other.
His broad face was attentive, as if he were hearing these things for the
first time. Gyalo had no doubt, however, that the Bearer already knew everything
that was to be known about him. This recital was, in some way, a test.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Did your father ever return?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One, about a year after my mother died. He wanted me to
have a military career, not a religious one. He demanded that I be taken
from the monastery and given to him. The monks told me I could choose, and
that if I wanted to stay they would honor my wishes. I decided to stay. My
father was angry--he tried to get the courts to intervene, he even petitioned
the overlord of Rimpang province. But then he was called away. He never came
back. I heard later that he died in the Jingya epidemics.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Why did you decide to stay? You didn&#8217;t yet know you were a Shaper.
And you were very young--too young, surely, to know what you desired for
the rest of your life.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;From the time I can remember, Old One, &Acirc;rata has called me.
One of the earliest memories I have is of the Rimpang temple core--the image
of &Acirc;rata Creator, the incense and the candles, the offerings and the
silence. I loved the silence--I thought I could feel the god within it. I
think I always wanted to vow the Way, though I never truly understood that
until my father tried to make me a soldier.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;You would have come to the Way in any case, being what you are, whether your father wished it or not.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One. But most Shapers never choose their service--they
are chosen, by their ability. But I <i>did</i> choose, before ever I knew what I
was. I feel blessed to have been granted that chance.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer studied Gyalo; at his feet, Vimata gravely echoed his spirit-brother&#8217;s
attention. The Bearer&#8217;s heavy-lidded gaze was extraordinarily direct, and
also extraordinarily opaque. Gyalo could feel the force of the powerful personality
behind it; he could see the ancient intelligence that lived in those eyes.
But he could not begin to guess what the Bearer might be thinking.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Go on,&#8221; the Bearer said. &#8220;You became a postulant, then.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One. I completed my training, and swore the Sixfold Vow.
I was assigned to work in Rimpang library while I studied for my Shaper ordination.
After I was ordained, I took the administrative examinations. The Son Utamnos
selected me from the position lists. I served him for five years in Rimpang,
and for the past six months here in Baushpar.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;You give a very brief account of yourself. I understand your exam scores were extraordinary.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I was told so, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Come now, no false modesty.&#8221; The Bearer smiled a little. &#8220;My Brother
Utamnos informs me that you have an acute grasp of your own abilities.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo felt himself flush. &#8220;I do know my strengths, Old One. I try to know my weaknesses also.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Ah.&#8221; The Bearer picked up the jewel on his chest, his blunt fingers
caressing the wire of its cage in an absent, habitual gesture. &#8220;It is quite
a skill, to understand one&#8217;s weaknesses. Most people have some notion of
their talents, but few know their failings half so well. And often it is
an ignorance deliberately cultivated.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo could not take his eyes off the Bearer&#8217;s fingers, probing
gently at the golden lattice. What was it like to touch the Blood of &Acirc;rata?
Did it radiate warmth like the blood it had been, or chill like the crystal
it had become? Did the god&#8217;s divinity resonate in it, as his immanence did
in the silence of his temples? Or had its nearness grown so familiar that
the Bearer no longer noticed such things? There was an offhand quality to
his gesture that suggested this.<br>
<br>
The Bearer&#8217;s brows were raised again. Gyalo struggled to rein in his thoughts.<br>
<br>
&#8220;I agree, Old One,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I strive to avoid self-deception.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;According to Utamnos, you are unusually diligent in that regard.
He says you turn toward the truth even when it is painful for you to do so.&#8221;
The Bearer paused. &#8220;He also tells me that your manita dose is unusually high.&#8221;<br>
<br>
This time Gyalo felt his face go scarlet. &#8220;Then he must have told
you, Old One,&#8221; he said carefully, &#8220;that my dose is stable, and has been for
some time now.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Indeed. And that, prior to its stabilization, you never attempted
to abuse your shaping, unlike some who require frequent dosage adjustment.
That you yourself approached him, in fact, when you sensed your tether had
become inadequate.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One. As any Shaper should.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;And yet other Shapers have fallen into apostasy that way. Those
with naturally strong abilities especially find it difficult to accept the
limitation of the drug. Haven&#8217;t you been tempted?&#8221;<br>
<br>
The room seemed to have grown very still. The Bearer&#8217;s eyes gleamed,
unblinking as a hawk&#8217;s; the jewel, with which he no longer toyed, shone on
his broad chest like a tiny sun. Beside him, his spirit-brother was an attentive
shadow. Gyalo understood, with sure instinct, that this was not just another
question; a turning point of some sort had been reached.<br>
<br>
&#8220;When I started my Shaper training, Old One,&#8221; he began, carefully,
&#8220;I did resent manita&#8217;s grip upon my shaping. Because of that, and also out
of curiosity, I did things I shouldn&#8217;t have done, experimented with my ability
in ways I knew were forbidden. I won&#8217;t excuse myself by saying I was only
a boy, or that I hadn&#8217;t yet taken the Shaper vow, or that most trainee Shapers
do the same. I knew the Doctrine of Baushpar, I knew the words of my teachers,
and so I knew it was wrong. That should have been enough.&#8221;<br>
<br>
He drew a breath. Images of that time stirred uncomfortably in memory. If he
tried, he could still recapture the ghost of the desire that had driven him,
the breathless mix of shame and guilt and excitement his secret explorations
had produced. It was not easy to talk of this. His preceptor in Rimpang had
known, and he had confessed to Utamnos early in their association. But to
no one else.<br>
<br>
&#8220;As I grew older, and my understanding of the Way of &Acirc;rata
deepened, it did become enough. But I cannot lie--I was still curious, and
it wasn&#8217;t always faith that kept me pure, but only will. Then I was put to
work in Rimpang library. I have an interest in the past, in the history of
the church. I came upon the first-hand accounts of the Shaper War. I&#8217;d never
seen such documents--all I knew of the War was the texts that are given in
the postulant classes. I read them all, every account I could find. And I
came to understand--not just to accept through my training or to hold through
my vows, but to truly <i>understand</i>--the need for limitation. Shaping freed
to human will, to human desire, is a terrible anarchy. Those who follow it
in that way don&#8217;t care for what it is, but only for what it can do. They
may begin by acknowledging its sacredness, but always they grow corrupt, and end by pursuing
greed and gain. And down that road lies catastrophe.<br>
<br>
&#8220;So my answer to your question, Old One, is this: the cure for desire
is knowledge. I see that road too clearly now ever to set my feet upon it.
Since that time, I have not been tempted.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer&#8217;s eyes held his. For a moment there was silence. Then
the Bearer smiled--fully this time, though his eyes remained hooded. Beside
him Vimata smiled also, a graceful mirror.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Your master promised you would impress me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was correct.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo bowed his head. He felt as if he had stood in the path of a whirlwind, and been passed over. "You honor me, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;To business, then.&#8221; The Bearer shifted again in his chair, a restlessness
that did not suggest impatience so much as the driving demand of an energy
too great to be held still. &#8220;Obviously, I haven&#8217;t called you here just to
question you. I understand your master has set you to reading the accounts
of that abomination, Thuxra City?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Thuxra City was a prison, built by the Caryaxist government ten
years after the uprising that brought it to power, as part of its transition
from egalitarian revolution to authoritarian state. Over the years, as hardening
ideology and popular unrest bred escalating repression, Thuxra grew to enormous
proportions. In addition to political prisoners and ordinary
people accused of a wide variety of anti-communal offenses, many vowed &Acirc;ratists
were confined there, monks and nuns who defied secularization orders, or
were found to have taken vows in secret, or were discovered in more active
forms of resistance, such as smuggling dissidents to safety across Arsace&#8217;s
borders.<br>
<br>
Thuxra stood on the far side of the massive range of mountains known
as the Range of Clouds, at the edge of the Burning Land. There were many
practical reasons to build a prison in such a hostile and isolated place,
where escape meant death, and only the prisoners and those who guarded them
knew exactly what went on inside. But it was ideology that had caused the
Caryaxists to situate Thuxra in &Acirc;rata&#8217;s sacred land--a deliberate defilement
of holy ground, a powerful demonstration of their contempt for the &Acirc;ratist
traditions that for centuries had kept the Burning Land inviolate, disturbed
only by pilgrims and holy men. One of the Brethren&#8217;s most urgent priorities
was Thuxra&#8217;s dismantlement.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Before Thuxra,&#8221; the Bearer said, &#8220;Caryaxist officials used Arsace&#8217;s
existing prisons to hold vowed &Acirc;ratists whom they did not choose to
execute or secularize. Sometimes, though, to save space and also because
it was considered...appropriate, vowed &Acirc;ratists were banished directly
into the Burning Land.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo drew in his breath. &#8220;I&#8217;d thought that was only a rumor, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Unfortunately very little of what we heard about the Caryaxists
during our exile in Rimpang has turned out to be rumor. The faithful were
marched over the mountains, stripped naked, and chased out into the Land.
Any who attempted to return were killed.&#8221; The Bearer smiled, this time with
singular grimness. &#8220;It&#8217;s all documented. They were dedicated record-keepers,
the Caryaxists.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The practice ceased once Thuxra was built, for the Caryaxists discovered
the Land could be mined, and it was more profitable to keep all their prisoners
alive for labor. It was assumed, of course, that the banished &Acirc;ratists
had perished. It&#8217;s a deadly environment even for a man at full strength,
which those poor souls most certainly were not. However....&#8221; The Bearer paused.
&#8220;For some decades now, our Dreamers have been dreaming of something odd,
deep inside the Land. They are vague, these Dreams--the Dreamers can&#8217;t even
say, really, what it is they sense. It&#8217;s there, though, where nothing ever
was before, some sort of...disturbance, far out in the wastes. Until recently,
not knowing a great deal about what was going on inside Arsace, we had no
reason to assume it was anything but natural--volcanic eruption, or something
of the sort. But now, with the records available to us, we think it might
be human--or more precisely, the exercise of a human power.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Do you mean...&#8221; Gyalo was incredulous. &#8220;Do you mean to say there are survivors?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;We think it&#8217;s possible.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;But how? The Land is waterless. There&#8217;s nothing to eat, nothing to live on.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;In the <i>Book of the Messenger</i> it&#8217;s written that the Messenger was
nourished on the food of the gods and the nectar of paradise when he followed
&Acirc;rata&#8217;s dream into the wastes. It seems those things may not have been
entirely miraculous. There is sustenance in the Land, and water, for those
who know how to find them--the Caryaxists discovered this during their time
at Thuxra, as they pushed outward in search of gems and copper and gold.
On the other hand...&#8221; Again the Bearer paused. &#8220;The records show that only
Dreamers and Forceless were banished in this way. Whatever else you may say
about the Caryaxists, they weren&#8217;t fools--they understood the risk of unbound
shaping, which is why they were so relentless in pursuit of them. But suppose
a Shaper, or perhaps more than one, decided to pass himself off as Forceless
to save his life, and was taken along with the others?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;And without manita--&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo was silent, considering this possibility--that Shapers released
from the tether of manita and forced into the Burning Land had used their
ability to save themselves, and that their descendants had survived. There
had been many Shaper apostasies over the course of &Acirc;ratist history,
particularly during the centuries just after the Shaper War and the formulation
of the Doctrine of Baushpar, as the church took steps to gather shaping to
itself; but they had been quickly discovered and dealt with. Even the most
vigorous had lasted no more than a decade. This desert community, on the
other hand, would have existed for seventy or more years--two, possibly three,
generations without manita. It was a staggering idea.<br>
<br>
&#8220;So you believe that shaping is causing the disturbances the Dreamers have dreamed, Old One?&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer shook his head. &#8220;Truly, at this point, all is speculation.
We know nothing for certain, not even that there were Shapers to begin with.
But whatever the truth may be, we must discover it. We cannot tolerate the
possibility that human beings may languish in such dreadful exile--nor can
we countenance such a disturbance of &Acirc;rata&#8217;s sacred resting place.
If there are survivors, they must be found and brought back to Arsace.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo felt as if the floor had just shifted, very slightly, beneath
his feet. The events of the past days--the summons, the reading, Utamnos&#8217;s
evasiveness--fell abruptly into place inside his mind. &#8220;A rescue expedition,&#8221;
he said.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes. King Santaxma in his generosity has agreed to equip it, and
also to provide a military staff. We must be grateful for His Majesty's eagerness
to aid the church in this urgent matter.&#8221;<br>
<br>
One would not guess, from the formality of the Bearer&#8217;s manner,
that he and Santaxma were fast friends, and had been so since childhood.
Santaxma was the scion of the only branch of the Arsacian royal family to
survive the massacre that brought the Caryaxists to power; he and the Bearer
had grown up side by side in Rimpang, dreaming a shared dream of Arsacian
freedom. They came to power together also, Santaxma crowned King-in-Exile
only a few months after the Bearer&#8217;s election. Together, they embarked upon
the fulfillment of their vision, Santaxma raising men, the Bearer raising
money. Now Santaxma reigned again in Arsace, and the Brethren ruled once
more in Baushpar--a dual restoration, but a single triumph.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Know,&#8221; the Bearer said, &#8220;that this decision has not been lightly
made. We detest the necessity of intruding upon the god&#8217;s rest. But &Acirc;rata
has already been disturbed, over and over, by the death and suffering the
Caryaxists brought into his sacred Land--and by these survivors, if indeed
that is what they are. We will add only briefly to his disquiet, and when
we are finished his peace will be entirely restored. The god who created
us, who made us out of his own bright nature, would not expect us to set
tradition above service, when so great a wrong may need to be put right.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I understand, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I suspect you also understand that you are to be part of the expedition.&#8221;<br>
<br>
It was true. Even so, to hear it spoken stole Gyalo&#8217;s breath. &#8220;I will do my best to serve, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer raised his brows. &#8220;You sound uncertain.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I confess, Old One...I do not understand why I have been chosen.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;How so?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I&#8217;m a Chonggye ordinate, Old One. I&#8217;ve lived almost all my life
in Rimpang. My knowledge is of history and administration. I have no
martial training, and barely any familiarity with travel. I wonder that you
would not want someone...more experienced.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;You are physically strong. That&#8217;s clear to look at you. You&#8217;re a competitive runner, I believe?&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I was, Old One. It&#8217;s been some time since I competed.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The point is that you are fit, and accustomed to endurance. Martial
matters needn&#8217;t concern you--that is what the soldiers are for. As for
experience...no one has experience of the sort of journey you will be undertaking.
In that, you are at no greater disadvantage than the others.&#8221; He watched
Gyalo a moment, shrewdly. &#8220;Your doubt is natural. But know that a great deal
of care has gone into planning this expedition. You will be leaving from
Thuxra City, as the lost &Acirc;ratists did. You will have a man from Thuxra to
show you the ways of survival in the Burning Land. The soldiers will cope
with the practical aspects of travel...and other areas in which their skills
may be needed. There will be Dreamers to serve as guides. There will be Forceless
to help you prepare those you may find for return to Arsace. And there will
be you, a Shaper, to maintain the requirements of ritual, to supervise the
other &Acirc;ratists, to record the journey--and, if necessary, to provide
a historical perspective on Shaper apostasy, from your close knowledge of
the Shaper War. So as you can see, it&#8217;s not for your knowledge of a sword
or your travel skills that you&#8217;ve been chosen.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo bowed his head. &#8220;I understand, Old One. Thank you.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The soldiers will arrive within the fortnight, so if you&#8217;ve any
outstanding business, take care of it now. My Sister Sundit is overseeing
the travel plans. She&#8217;ll summon you for briefing in the next day or so.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Yes, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;In the meantime, don&#8217;t speak of this to anyone other than the Brethren--not
even to your fellow aides. The purpose of this expedition is not generally
known. We do not wish to stir more speculation than we must.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;I understand, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Come.&#8221; The Bearer stretched out his right arm, his powerful muscles flexing. &#8220;I will give you my blessing.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo approached and sank to his knees, bowing his face so that
all he could see was the gleaming silk of the Bearer&#8217;s trousers and the upturned
toes of his embroidered indoor shoes. The Bearer&#8217;s hand descended upon his
head, the palm wide and warm against his shaven scalp, the fingers easily
encircling his skull. It was a gentle grip, but he could feel the leashed
power of it, the weight of flesh and bone in the arm above.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Go in light, child of &Acirc;rata, vowed servant of the god. May
your bright nature lead you forward, and your ash-nature follow after you.
May the light of &Acirc;rata overflow your soul, and the darkness of the
Enemy never trouble you. May your faith guide you, and your obedience keep
you, and your compassion lend you strength. These are all the tools you need.
In the name of &Acirc;rata, in the name of his First Messenger, in the name
of his church, by the power of his sacred Blood, I give you blessing. Go
in light, child of &Acirc;rata, vowed servant of the god.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The Bearer&#8217;s fingers tightened briefly, then withdrew. But it
seemed to Gyalo that he could still feel the burden of that great hand--a
metaphorical burden now, of expectation and purpose. The sinews of his neck
ached with tension. He rocked back onto the balls of his feet, and stood.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Thank you, Old One.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Journey well, Brother Gyalo.&#8221; The Bearer&#8217;s hand had descended to
lie lightly upon Vimata's sleek black head. &#8220;Go in light.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Gyalo bowed. &#8220;Great is &Acirc;rata. Great is his Way."<br>
<br>
One of the Tapati guards led him back through Evening City, turning
aside when the doors to the entrance pavilion came in sight. He walked homeward
in the twilight. The people of Baushpar had gone indoors to their suppers,
and the streets were all but deserted. He picked his way through the litter
of the procession--heaps of ox-dung and shreds of ribbon and clots of straw,
and here and there a little piece of shining matter, the remains of blessings
that an inexperienced trainee Shaper had invested with too much substance.
But he scarcely saw these things. The Bearer&#8217;s necklace hung before his inner
eye: the gleam of golden lattice, the quiver of flame at the heart of the
crystal of the Blood. Soon, very soon, he would walk the red sands from which
that crystal had come. He had to breathe deeply and set his feet hard upon
the ground to convince himself he was not dreaming.
