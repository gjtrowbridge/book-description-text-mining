It is often
said that America "invented" democracy. This view is, of course, an
understatement; America invented not only democracy, but freedom, justice,
liberty, and "time-sharing." But representative democracy is unquestionably
our proudest achievement, the creation most uniquely our own, even if the rest
of the Western world would have come up with the idea themselves by the 1820s.
So why, then, has participation in this most wondrous system withered?</p>

<p>As heirs to
a legacy more than two centuries old, it is understandable why present-day
Americans would take their own democracy for granted. A president freely chosen
from a wide-open field of two men every four years; a Congress with a 99%
incumbency rate; a Supreme Court comprised of nine politically appointed judges
whose only oversight is the icy scythe of Death&#151; all these reveal a system
fully capable of maintaining itself. But our perfect democracy, which neither
needs nor particularly wants voters, is a rarity. It is important to remember
there still exist many other forms of government in the world today, and that
dozens of foreign countries still long for a democracy such as ours to be
imposed on them.</p>

<p>To regain
our sense of perspective and wonder, we must take a broader historical view,
looking beyond America's relatively recent success story to examine our
predecessors and their adorable failures. In this chapter, we will briefly
explore the evolution of an idea, following the <i>H.M.S. Democracy</i> on her
dangerous voyage through the mists of time, past the Straits of Monarchy,
surviving Hurricane Theocracy, then navigating around the Cape of Good Feudal
System to arrive, battered but safe, at her destined port-of-call: Americatown.</p>



<p><strong>Early Man: More Animal Than Political</strong><br>
The human
race is by nature brutal, amoral, unreasonable and self-centered, but for the
first few hundred thousand years of our existence as a species, we were way too
obvious about it. Primitive culture centered on survival of the individual and,
occasionally, survival of someone the individual might want to reproduce with
(see 1981's harrowing documentary <i>Caveman</i>. Civic institutions were
non-existent, as was debate, which would appear later after the invention of
the frontal lobe. For prehistoric man the rule of law, such as it was, could
best be summed up by the seminal case <i>Marbury's Head v. Madison's Rock</i>.</p>

<p>Early man
lived this tenuous Darwinian nightmare for an age or two, until a peculiar
thing happened: The unfittest decided they wouldn't mind surviving either. The
feeble and weak realized that without a good plan they weren't going to make it out of the Stone Age to see the wonder that was clay. Alone, they were mammoth meat. Together, they would
become a force with a chance to see the day when their children's children
would be only 75% covered in hair. From these noble impulses, the groundwork
for the first civilizations was laid.</p>



<p><strong>Athens: Our Big Fat Greek Forerunners</strong><br>
<b>Ancient
Greece</b> is widely
credited with creating the world's first democracy. It would be a worthy
endeavor to travel back in time to the feta-strewn shores of fifth-century B.C.
Athens and ask Plato to define democracy, and not only to make money gambling
on Olympics results that we, being from the future, would already know. Plato would
tell us, in that affectionate but non-sexual way of his, that
"democracy" is a Greek word combining the roots for
"people" ("<i>demos</i>-") and "rule" ("-<i>kratia</i>").
In Greek democracy, political power was concentrated not in the hands of one
person, or even a small group of people, but rather evenly and fairly
distributed among all the people<sup>1</sup>, meaning every John Q.
Publikopolous could play a role in Athenian government. The main legislative
body, the Assembly, was comprised of no less than the first 6,000 citizens to
arrive at its meetings&#151;and bear in mind, no saving seats. Jury duty was
considered an honor to be vied for. Membership in most other civic
institutions, including the Supreme Court, was chosen...by lot! Imagine a
system in which anyone could wind up serving on the Supreme Court. Anyone.
Think about your own family. Friends. The guys you knew in college who would
eat dog feces for ten dollars. Now picture one of them as your randomly chosen
Chief Justice, and you'll appreciate just how fucked-up this system was.</p>

<p>Compared
with American democracy, the Athenian version seems simplistic, naive, and gay.
Transcripts of early Athenian policy debates reveal a populace moved more by
eloquence and rationality than demagogues and fear-mongering. Thankfully, this
type of humane governance wasn't allowed to take root. Athens's great
experiment ended after less than two centuries, when, in 338 B.C., Philip of
Macedon's forces invaded the city, inflicting on its inhabitants the eternal
fate of the noble and enlightened: to be brutally crushed by the armed and
dumb.</p>



<p><strong>Rome: The First Republicans</strong><br>
The fall of
Athens was followed by the emergence, overnight, of <b>Rome</b>. At first
glance its people<sup>2</sup> appear to have enjoyed a system of representative
government similar to ours. True, behind its fa?ade of allegedly
"representative" officials Iurked a <i>de facto</i> oligarchy ruled
by entrenched plutocrats. But the similarities don't end there. In fact, the
Founding Fathers borrowed many of their ideas from the Roman model, including its
bicameral legislature, its emphasis on republicanism and civic virtue, and its
Freudian fascination with big white columns.</p>

<p>However,
there was very little real democracy in Rome. While the Senate theoretically
represented the people, in reality its wealthy members covertly pursued
pro-business legislation on behalf of such military-industrial giants as
JavelinCorp, United Crucifix, and a cartel of resource-exploiting companies
known as Big Aqueduct. They even monopolized the most notorious aspect of Roman
life, instituting an orgy policy that can literally be described as
"trickle-down."</p>

<p>Vomitoriums
aside, Rome's biggest contribution to American government was probably its
legal system, which codified key concepts like equal protection, "innocent
until proven guilty," and the right to confront one's accusers. These very
same issues would later form the basis of both the Bill of Rights and a
mind-numbing quantity of <i>Law and Order</i> scripts. But by the time of
Rome's huge millennium celebration marking the beginning of O A.D., the faint
light of Roman democracy was all but extinguished. The Republic had given way
to Empire. The only voting to speak of took place in the Colosseum and was
generally limited to a handful of disembowelment-related issues. In time, the
Empire itself fell, as history teaches us all empires inevitably must.<sup>3</sup>
Its most enduring legacy: a numerical system that allowed future generations to
more easily keep track of Super Bowls.</p>

<p><strong>The Magna Carta: Power to the Extremely Wealthy People</strong><br>
And then,
darkness. For more than 1,000 years democracy disappeared from the European
scene. The period instead saw the blossoming of an exciting array of alternate
forms of government, such as monarchy, absolute monarchy, kingship, queenhood,
and three different types of oppression (religious/ethnic/"for shits and
giggles"). As for individual liberty, "innocent until proven
guilty" was rapidly supplanted by a more aggressive law-and-order approach
better characterized as "guilty until proven flammable."</p>

<p>Democracy
had disappeared. The people needed a champion, and as is usually the case, the
obscenely rich rode to the rescue. In 1215, England's wealthy barons refused to
give King John the money he needed to wage war unless he signed the <b>Magna
Carta</b>. The document codified that no man was above the law. Unfortunately
for the peasant class, it did little to address how many were below it.
Startlingly ahead of its time, this extraordinary document had a profound
effect on people<sup>4</sup> and continues to shape twenty-first-century views
on topics as diverse as escheat, socage, burage, novel disseisin, and the
bailiwicks of Gerard of Athee. But even more importantly, the Magna Carta set a
powerful precedent for our own Founding Fathers: There was no more powerful
means of safeguarding individual liberty than a vaguely worded manifesto inked
in inscrutable cursive on dilapidated parchment.</p>

<p>The Magna
Carta served as a wake-up call that Europe would be forced to answer?in about
five hundred years. For Lady Democracy, having lain dormant for more than a
millennium, had risen from its slumber only to stretch its arms, reach for the
clock, and groggily set the snooze bar for "The Enlightenment."</p>

<p><strong>The 17th and 18th Centuries: Enlightening Strikes</strong><br>
Though a
promising development for democracy, the Magna Carta was mostly ignored as the
world plunged into what would be known as the Dark Ages. It was an apt title
for an era when amoebic dysentery was considered the <i>good</i> kind of
dysentery. Oppression and high mortality rates seemed ready to swallow what
remained of mankind, when through the darkness emerged the light that would be
its salvation: Reason. It began slowly. "Hey, what if we stop storing the
corpses in the drinking water and see if that makes any difference to our
health?" From there, it gathered momentum. Soon, all conventional wisdom,
from the shape of the Earth to whether the ruling class could have your hut
burned and your organs removed because they thought you caused an eclipse, was
up for grabs. This last question proved especially pertinent for the future of
democracy and ushered in an era known as <b>the Enlightenment.</b></p>

<p>The
Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, would finally provide democracy
with its philosophical underpinnings. The 17th and 18th centuries produced a
wave of prominent thinkers espousing political systems based on what they
called "the social contract." Government, they theorized, was a sort
of legal agreement between the rulers and the ruled, the terms of which were
binding on both parties. It was a groundbreaking theory. All they needed now
was some country dumb enough to try it before the King found out and had them
all drawn and quartered.</p>

<p>Democracy
needed a fresh start&#151;hearty and idealistic champions who would strike out for a
new world, willing to risk everything for the principles of equality, liberty,
justice ... and slaves. We'd need some slaves and guns. But we're getting ahead
of ourselves. A new world awaited.</p>
