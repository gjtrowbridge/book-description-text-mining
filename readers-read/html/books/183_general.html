		<div><B>Chapter Excerpt</B></div><BR><h4 align="center">Chapter One</h4>

<p>A boy with a parrot on his shoulder was walking
along the railway tracks. His gait was dreamy
and he swung a daisy as he went. With each
step the boy dragged his toes in the rail bed, as
if measuring out his journey with careful ruled marks of his
shoetops in the gravel. It was midsummer, and there was
something about the black hair and pale face of the boy
against the green unfurling flag of the downs beyond, the
rolling white eye of the daisy, the knobby knees in their
short pants, the self-important air of the handsome gray
parrot with its savage red tail feather, that charmed the old
man as he watched them go by. Charmed him, or aroused
his sense -- a faculty at one time renowned throughout Europe
 -- of promising anomaly.</p>

<p>The old man lowered the latest number of <em>The British Bee Journal</em> to the rug of Shetland wool that was spread
across his own knobby but far from charming knees, and
brought the long bones of his face closer to the windowpane.
The tracks -- a spur of the Brighton-Eastbourne line,
electrified in the late twenties with the consolidation of the
Southern Railway routes -- ran along an embankment a hundred
yards to the north of the cottage, between the concrete
posts of a wire fence. It was ancient glass the old man peered
through, rich with ripples and bubbles that twisted and
toyed with the world outside. Yet even through this distorting
pane it seemed to the old man that he had never before
glimpsed two beings more intimate in their parsimonious
sharing of a sunny summer afternoon than these.</p>

<p>He was struck, as well, by their apparent silence. It
seemed probable to him that in any given grouping of an
African gray parrot -- a notoriously prolix species -- and a
boy of nine or ten, at any given moment, one or the other of
them ought to be talking. Here was another anomaly. As for
what it promised, this the old man -- though he had once
made his fortune and his reputation through a long and brilliant
series of extrapolations from unlikely groupings of
facts -- could not, could never, have begun to foretell.</p>

<p>As he came nearly in line with the old man's window,
some one hundred yards away, the boy stopped. He turned
his narrow back to the old man as if he could feel the latter's
gaze upon him. The parrot glanced first to the east, then to
the west, with a strangely furtive air. The boy was up to something. A hunching of the shoulders, an anticipatory
flexing of the knees. It was some mysterious business -- distant
in time but deeply familiar -- yes --</p>

<p>-- the toothless clockwork engaged; the unstrung Steinway
sounded: <em>the conductor rail</em>.</p>

<p>Even on a sultry afternoon like this one, when cold and
damp did not trouble the hinges of his skeleton, it could be
a lengthy undertaking, done properly, to rise from his chair,
negotiate the shifting piles of ancient-bachelor clutter --
newspapers both cheap and of quality, trousers, bottles of
salve and liver pills, learned annals and quarterlies, plates of
crumbs -- that made treacherous the crossing of his parlor,
and open his front door to the world. Indeed the daunting
prospect of the journey from armchair to doorstep was
among the reasons for his lack of commerce with the world,
on the rare occasions when the world, gingerly taking hold
of the brass door-knocker wrought in the hostile form of a
giant <em>Apis dorsata</em>, came calling. Nine visitors out of ten he
would sit, listening to the bemused mutterings and fumblings
at the door, reminding himself that there were few
now living for whom he would willingly risk catching the toe
of his slipper in the hearth rug and spilling the scant remainder
of his life across the cold stone floor. But as the boy
with the parrot on his shoulder prepared to link his own
modest puddle of electrons to the torrent of them being
pumped along the conductor, or third, rail from the Southern
Railway power plant on the Ouse outside of Lewes, the old man hoisted himself from his chair with such unaccustomed
alacrity that the bones of his left hip produced a disturbing
scrape. Lap rug and journal slid to the floor.<p>

<p>He wavered a moment, groping already for the door
latch, though he still had to cross the entire room to reach it.
His failing arterial system labored to supply his suddenly
skybound brain with useful blood. His ears rang and his
knees ached and his feet were plagued with stinging. He
lurched, with a haste that struck him as positively giddy,
toward the door, and jerked it open, somehow injuring, as he
did so, the nail of his right forefinger.</p>

<p>"You, boy!" he called, and even to his own ears his voice
sounded querulous, wheezy, even a touch demented. "Stop
that at once!"</p>

<p>The boy turned. With one hand he clutched at the fly of
his trousers. With the other he cast aside the daisy. The parrot
sidestepped across the boy's shoulders to the back of his
head, as if taking shelter there.</p>

<p>"Why, do you imagine, is there a <em>fence</em>?" the old man
said, aware that the barrier fences had not been maintained
since the war began and were in poor condition for ten miles
in either direction. "For pity's sake, you'd be fried like a
smelt!" As he hobbled across his dooryard toward the boy
on the tracks, he took no note of the savage pounding of his
heart. Or rather he noted it with anxiety and then covered
the anxiety with a hard remark. "One can only imagine the
<em>stench</em>."</p>

<p>Flower discarded, valuables restored with a zip to their
lodging, the boy stood motionless. He held out to the old
man a face as wan and empty as the bottom of a beggar's tin
cup ...
