<h4 align="center">Fire and Rain</h4>

<p>November 14, 01:33 <small>A.M.</small><br />
The British Museum<br />
London, England</p>

<p>Harry Masterson would be dead in thirteen minutes.</p>

<p>If he had known this, he would've smoked his last cigarette down to
the filter. Instead he stamped out the fag after only three drags and
waved the cloud from around his face. If he was caught smoking outside
the guards' break room, he would be shit-canned by that bastard Fleming,
head of museum security. Harry was already on probation for coming
in two hours late for his shift last week.</p>

<p>Harry swore under his breath and pocketed the stubbed cigarette.
He'd finish it at his next break ... that is, if they got a break this night.</p>

<p>Thunder echoed through the masonry walls. The winter storm had
struck just after midnight, opening with a riotous volley of hail, followed
by a deluge that threatened to wash London into the Thames. Lightning
danced across the skies in forked displays from one horizon to another.
According to the weatherman on the Beeb, it was one of the fiercest
electrical storms in over a decade. Half the city had been blacked out,
overwhelmed by a spectacular lightning barrage.</p>

<p>And as fortune would have it for Harry, it was <em>his</em> half of the city that
went dark, including the British Museum on Great Russell Street.
Though they had backup generators, the entire security team had been
summoned for additional protection of the museum's property. They
would be arriving in the next half hour. But Harry, assigned to the night
shift, was already on duty when the regular lights went out. And though the video surveillance cameras were still operational on the emergency
grid, he and the shift were ordered by Fleming to proceed with an immediate
security sweep of the museum's two and a half miles of halls.</p>

<p>That meant splitting up.</p>

<p>Harry picked up his electric torch and aimed it down the hall. He
hated doing rounds at night, when the museum was lost in gloom. The
only illumination came from the streetlamps outside the windows. But
now, with the blackout, even those lamps had been extinguished. The
museum had darkened to macabre shadows broken by pools of crimson
from the low-voltage security lamps.</p>

<p>Harry had needed a few hits of nicotine to steel his nerve, but he
could put off his duty no longer. Being the low man on the night shift's
pecking order, he had been assigned to run the halls of the north wing,
the farthest point from their underground security nest. But that didn't
mean he couldn't take a shortcut. Turning his back on the long hall
ahead, he crossed to the door leading into the Queen Elizabeth II Great
Court.</p>

<p>This central two-acre court was surrounded by the four wings of the
British Museum. At its heart rose the great copper-domed Round Reading
Room, one of the world's finest libraries. Overhead, the entire two-acre
courtyard had been enclosed by a gigantic Foster and Partners&#150;designed
geodesic roof, creating Europe's largest covered square.</p>

<p>Using his passkey, Harry ducked into the cavernous space. Like the
museum proper, the court was lost to darkness. Rain pattered against the
glass roof far overhead. Still, Harry's footsteps echoed across the open
space. Another lance of lightning shattered across the sky. The roof, divided
into a thousand triangular panes, lit up for a blinding moment.
Then darkness drowned back over the museum, drumming down with
the rain.</p>

<p>Thunder followed, felt deep in the chest. The roof rattled, too. Harry
ducked a bit, fearing the entire structure would come crashing down.</p>

<p>With his electric torch pointed forward, he crossed the court, heading
for the north wing. He rounded past the central Reading Room. Lightning
flashed again, brightening the place for a handful of heartbeats. Giant
statues, lost to the darkness, appeared as if from nowhere. <em>The Lion
of Cnidos</em> reared beside the massive head of an Easter Island statue.
Then darkness swallowed the guardians away as the lightning died out.</p>

<p>Harry felt a chill and pebbling of gooseflesh.</p>

<p>His pace hurried. He swore under his breath with each step, "Bleeding
buggered pieces of crap ... " His litany helped calm him.</p>

<p>He reached the doors to the north wing and ducked inside, greeted by
the familiar mix of mustiness and ammonia. He was grateful to have
solid walls around him again. He played his torch down the long hall.
Nothing seemed amiss, but he was required to check each of the wing's
galleries. He did a fast calculation. If he hurried, he could complete his
circuit with enough time for another fast smoke. With the promise of a
nicotine fix luring him, he set off down the hall, the beam of his torch
preceding him.</p>

<p>The north wing had become host to the museum's anniversary showcase,
an ethnographical collection portraying a complete picture of human
achievement down the ages, spanning all cultures. Like the
Egyptian gallery with its mummies and sarcophagi. He continued hurriedly,
ticking off the various cultural galleries: Celtic, Byzantine, Russian,
Chinese. Each suite of rooms was locked down by a security gate.
With the loss of power, the gates had dropped automatically.</p>

<p>At last, the hall's end came into sight.</p>

<p>Most of the galleries' collections were only temporarily housed here,
transferred from the Museum of Mankind for the anniversary celebration.
But the end gallery had always been here, for as far back as Harry
could recall. It housed the museum's Arabian display, a priceless collection
of antiquity from across the Arabian Peninsula. The gallery had
been commissioned and paid for by one family, a family grown rich by its
oil ventures in that region. The donations to keep such a gallery in permanent
residence at the British Museum was said to top five million
pounds per annum.</p>

<p>One had to respect that sort of dedication.</p>
