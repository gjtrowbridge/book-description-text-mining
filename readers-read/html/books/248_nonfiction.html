Music has always
            been my refuge from sadness. The guitar I inherited from my uncle
            John now has decent strings, and I�m no longer making the �broken�
            music that so upset my grandmother; in fact I�m making a lot of
            progress, but the limitations of my first instrument are holding me
            back. There are things that I simply can�t do with this primitive
            heirloom.<BR><BR>From the money I earned on the milk rounds I have
            saved up enough for a new acoustic guitar that I�ve had my eye on.
            It has been hanging from the wall in Braidford�s Music Shop for
            three months now. I go and see it after school every evening,
            praying that no one has bought it. It is a beautiful
            -steel--stringed instrument with a blond finish, an ebony
            fingerboard, and delicate marquetry inlaid around the sound hole. It
            costs me sixteen guineas, which is a large amount of money, but I�m
            in love for the very first time.<BR><BR>I first heard the Beatles in
            my final year at junior school. I remember being in the changing
            rooms of the swimming baths. Mr. Law had just supervised one of our
            chaotic and impossibly noisy trips to the baths--by �supervised� I
            mean that no one had actually been drowned. We were drying ourselves
            off and, as was our custom, flicking towels at each other�s
            genitals. It was at this point that we heard the first bars of �Love
            Me Do� from a transistor radio in the corner. The effect was
            immediate. There was something in the sparseness of the sound that
            immediately put a stop to the horseplay. John�s lonely harmonica and
            Paul�s bass played �two to the bar,� and then the vocal harmony
            moved in modal fifths up to minor thirds and back again to a solo
            voice on the refrain. Not that I could articulate any of this at the
            time, but I recognized something significant, even revolutionary, in
            the spare economy of the sound, and the interesting thing is, so did
            everyone else.<BR><BR>By the time �She Loves You� reached number one
            in the charts I was already at the grammar school, but it wasn�t the
            confident primitivism of the �yeah yeah yeah� chorus that excited me
            so much as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at
            the end of the coda. Again, I couldn�t articulate this then, but I
            knew as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the
            end of the coda. An old dance band clich�, but when the Beatles used
            it there seemed to be a subtle irony at work. Again, I couldn�t
            articulate this then, but I knew instinctively that it was pointing
            to a level of sophistication that I hadn�t been aware of in pop
            music until then. The Beatles would succeed in manipulating as many
            musical forms into their songs, whether classical, folk, rock and
            roll, the blues, Indian raga, or vaudeville, in a dizzying and
            seamless pastiche of ideas and cultural references. It was music
            without frontiers and the ubiquitous soundtrack for a generation
            that thought it could change the world.<BR><BR>Jim Berryman, in his
            otherwise excellent biography, <I>A Sting in the Tale</I>, claims
            that I was outside the City Hall when the Fab Four played there in
            1963, and that I managed to grab a lock of McCartney�s hair. This is
            of course fantasy, and would have been out of keeping with the
            budding intellectual pretensions that I was nurturing at the time.
            But it is impossible to stress too much the influence that the
            Beatles had on my early life, and the fact that they came from a
            similar background to my own was fundamental to the vague plans of
            escape and glory that I was hatching in my imagination. Lennon and
            McCartney were both grammar school boys from humble roots in
            Liverpool, a town not dissimilar from Newcastle. From their initial
            chart successes they went on to conquer the world with songs that
            they wrote themselves. This gave an entire generation of musicians
            the confidence and permission to at least attempt the same
            feat.<BR><BR><BR>I pore over Beatles albums with the same obsessive
            and forensic scrutiny that I�d applied to Rodgers and Hammerstein,
            only now I have a guitar. I have an instrument that can reproduce
            the practical magic of the chord structures and the network of riffs
            that their songs are built on. And what songs, one after the other,
            album after album. I learn to play them all, confident that if I
            persevere, what I can�t play immediately will yield its secret
            eventually. I will reapply the needle of the record player again and
            again to the bars of music that seem beyond my analysis, like a
            safecracker picking a lock, until the prize is mine. No school
            subject ever occupies as much of my time or energy. I�m not claiming
            that any kind of prescience about the future is at work here, but
            there is something in the driven and compulsive nature of this
            obsession that is unusual, something in the unconscious saying, This
            is how you escape. This is how you escape.<BR><BR>It is 1966 and
            England, having won the World Cup against Germany that summer, is at
            last enjoying the fruits of the postwar boom and is considered to
            be, in the quaint argot of the time, �swinging.� In Newcastle,
            however, the hedonism of social change and cultural revolution is
            limited to a small enclave surrounding the university. King�s
            College gives the pubs and clubs and bookshops an air of musty
            intellectualism and bohemian sophistication. Wittgenstein, of all
            people, is supposed to have spent some time in the city during the
            war--I can just see him trying to explain the more difficult
            passages of Tractatus -Logico--Philosophicus to the coves in the
            Haymarket snug in a blue haze of Woodbines and brown ale.<BR><BR>The
            Club A Go-Go is above some shops in Percy Street, behind the
            Haymarket. It was originally a jazz club catering to the
            sophisticated tastes that developed in and around the university.
            The Go-Go is where the Animals had their residency before they hit
            the big time, and living proof that the Beatles miracle could be
            repeated, even in Newcastle. When I am fifteen years old, the first
            live band I ever see is there: the Graham Bond Organisation. It is a
            fortunate introduction. Graham Bond is a big -round--faced man with
            long greasy hair and a mandarin mustache. He plays Hammond organ and
            alto sax and sings in a gruff and passionate baritone. His band
            contains figures who will soon become legends: Jack Bruce and Ginger
            Baker, who will become more famous as members of Cream, on bass and
            drums respectively, and Dick -Heckstall--Smith on tenor. The music
            is harsh and uncompromising and I�m not sure if I like it, but I
            have a strong sense that what is being played has a weight and a
            seriousness that will later be characterized and then caricatured as
            �heavy.� Graham Bond would later become obsessed with the occult and
            end his own life under a train in London�s Underground.<BR><BR>I go
            to see John Mayall�s Bluesbreakers, again at the Go-Go, although I
            don�t remember which of their subsequently legendary guitarists was
            on duty that night. It certainly wasn�t Clapton, though it may have
            been Peter Green. But it wasn�t until December of that year that I
            really had my mind blown.<BR><BR>I would watch Top of the Pops with
            a religious devotion at 7:30 every Thursday evening. I loved this
            show with a passion. Almost forty years later I can still see a
            picture of the DJ, Jimmy Savile, standing in front of a large chart
            of the top twenty, circa 1966, and am able to sing a line from every
            entry. Such familiarity with the music of the time could not,
            however, have prepared me for the whirlwind, the tidal wave, the
            earthquake, the force of nature that was Jimi Hendrix.<BR><BR>The
            Jimi Hendrix Experience appeared on Top of the Pops in December of
            1966 and changed everything. Hendrix had transformed �Hey Joe,� an
            old folk song, and propelled it by the elegant ferocity of his
            guitar playing into a sassy, bluesy vehicle of awesome power. His
            vocal was as sulky and offhand as it was passionate and openly
            sexual, and as the -three--piece band stormed through the
            -three--minute song, I imagined everyone in whole country in front
            of their tellys sitting bolt upright in their chairs.<BR><BR>Wow!
            What the fuck was that?<BR><BR>It seemed only days later that he
            would be booked to appear at the Go-Go. The excitement in the town
            is palpable. I am technically too young to gain admission to a
            nightclub, but because of my height I can easily pass for eighteen.
            I have brought a change of clothes in my schoolbag, a pair of Levi�s
            and a white Ben Sherman shirt with a -button--down collar. These are
            the �coolest� clothes I have, and look fine under my school
            overcoat. I change out of my uniform in the toilets at the Central
            Station, trying not to breathe. The lavatory is foul with the
            pungent stench of urine and sadness. I dress with mesmeric slowness,
            not wanting to drop any of my clothes on the filthy floor, beneath a
            faded Ministry of Health poster warning of the dangers of VD. Some
            hope! I still haven�t come close to having sex. There are no girls
            at school, and most of my evenings are taken up traveling home on
            trains and buses. When I do get home, I usually have a punitive
            amount of work to do, and when on those rare opportunities I do meet
            girls I am painfully shy and haven�t a clue what to say. But the
            other reason is music; I already have my passion. I stow my bag in
            the lockers at the station and set off at a brisk pace for Percy
            Street, breathing in the crisp air of the evening in grateful gulps
            and anticipating something extraordinary.<BR><BR>There is a long
            queue stretching around the corner. I tuck myself into the end of
            the line and wait. I imagine I�m one of the youngest people there,
            although my height allows me some anonymity in the crowd. They are
            mainly boys, dressed much the same as me, although a few dandified
            �exotics� have managed to purchase Afghan coats and are sporting
            droopy Zapata mustaches and spiffy desert boots. The girls all have
            the same style, hair parted severely in the middle and falling in
            lank sheets to the shoulders of black leather coats. There is an
            atmosphere of seriousness, though, that pervades the crowd, as if we
            are about to witness an event of high cultural significance. Hendrix
            will play two sets. I manage to scrape in for the first one, which
            is fortunate, as I would have had to find some convincing excuse to
            stay out so late for the second. My parents have no idea where I am,
            and I have no wish to tell them. One of the dividends of my
            alienation is that I don�t have much explaining to do and am pretty
            much left to my own devices.<BR><BR>The club is tiny and I secure a
            pitch for myself halfway between the stage and the back wall. I will
            have no trouble seeing. The band of course are late. The crowd waits
            patiently.<BR><BR>They say that �if you remember the sixties, then
            you weren�t there.�<BR><BR>Well, much the same could be said of this
            gig. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was an overwhelming, deafening wave
            of sound that simply obliterated analysis. I think I remember
            snatches of �Hey Joe� and �Foxy Lady,� but that event remains a blur
            of noise and breathtaking virtuosity, of Afro�d hair, wild clothes,
            and towers of Marshall amplifiers. It was also the first time I�d
            ever seen a black man. I remember Hendrix creating a hole in the
            plaster ceiling above the stage with the head of his guitar, and
            then it was over.<BR><BR>I lay in my bed that night with my ears
            ringing and my worldview significantly altered.<BR><BR><BR>I did
            enough schoolwork to get by, but no more. All I wanted to do was
            play the guitar and listen to records. I listened exhaustively to
            Dylan and memorized great tracts of his lyricism, from �The Lonesome
            Death of Hattie Carroll� to �Gates of Eden.� I also learned to like
            jazz, the hard way.<BR>I developed a number of friendships with
            older boys in the school who recognized the seriousness of my
            musical obsessions. One of them lent me two albums by Thelonious
            Monk, Monk Live at Olympia in Paris and Monk Solo. I was at first
            baffled by the angular complexity of the melodies and the density of
            the underlying harmonies, but had an inkling that there was
            something important here. I persevered, in the same way I persevered
            with the books my grandmother lent me, or the way I figured out how
            to play the guitar pragmatically, unschooled but determined. I had
            no intellectual approach, just sheer -bloody--mindedness. I would
            come home from school, put Monk on, begin my homework, and let the
            music teach me by osmosis as I struggled with some abstruse geometry
            proof. When I heard Miles Davis and John Coltrane, I realized that
            these musicians were exploring the outer reaches of human
            understanding like physicists in a sound laboratory.<BR><BR>I wonder
            if I would have developed even a small understanding of such music
            if I hadn�t first put the time and effort into listening. I am no
            jazz musician, but I�ve put in enough work to have some
            understanding of it and develop a common language with those who do
            play it.<BR><BR><BR>By 1967 my parents have saved enough money to
            move the family to a semidetached house near the coast in Tynemouth,
            only a few miles downriver from Wallsend. After all these years
            they�re miraculously still together, or at least nominally so, being
            under the same roof. Divorce simply isn�t an option for people like
            us, either financially or socially. It just isn�t done. I�m relieved
            that we haven�t had to deal with the seismic upheaval of a divorce,
            but sometimes, exhausted by the constant emotional static that
            crackles and then festers just below the surface of the house, I
            wish the whole thing would just blow itself -sky-high, once and for
            all.<BR><BR>I am too awkward and clumsy to be much good at football,
            but I can run. No one has ever beaten me over one hundred yards at
            any of the schools I have attended. I am -big--boned and strong from
            all the exercise I get working with my dad and, of course, all the
            free milk.<BR><BR>I hold the school record for the hundred yards and
            have qualified for the Northumberland County championships in
            Ashington. It is the summer of 1967 and I am sixteen. This is the
            biggest race of my life. I can recall the nausea of waiting for the
            starting pistol, the agony of the silences between the instructions:
            �On your marks�� My spiked feet in their blocks, measuring the
            distance between my left knee and my fingertips. �Get set�� Now an
            eternity as I raise my head and push back on my hips and stare down
            the long tunnel to the finishing line. Bang!<BR><BR>I return home
            that evening flushed with pride and victory, having won the race by
            a good length and blurting out the news of my triumph to my father,
            who is rousing himself from his afternoon sleep on the sofa. �That�s
            very nice, son,� is his only response, before he drifts off to the
            kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. I am at first deflated and
            then angry at him. He is too embedded in his own unhappiness to be
            able to really share in my success or take pride in it as something
            that he himself helped to create. His pride in me will continue to
            be ossified in the bones of his sadness, unvoiced. I understand this
            now, but I didn�t then.<BR><BR>My running career ends that summer
            after I am beaten for the first time in the early rounds of a
            national tournament. I have lost heart in the sport, consoling
            myself with the knowledge that there is no strategy involved in
            sprinting, no real tactical training. You are either born with the
            right musculature to be the fastest, or you are not. Excellence in
            sports is cruelly definitive, and this is the nausea in the pit of
            your stomach and in your throat, this is the fear--that you will not
            be good enough, that you will be beaten, that you will
            fail.<BR><BR>I begin to fantasize that I will no longer seek my
            father�s attention, and yet a lot of my life has been nothing but a
            vain attempt to find approval, to find acceptance. And no matter how
            full my belly, I wonder, will I always feel hungry?<BR><BR>While I
            despise the new house and its suburban pretensions, it does have a
            garden, which my dad loves though he has to get up even earlier and
            drive back to Wallsend to do his round. He builds what he calls a
            conservatory in the back garden, but in reality it�s a -jerry--built
            shed with windows. He spends most of his days in there with the
            spiders and some -sad--looking cactuses.<BR><BR>My mother still goes
            out on a Thursday night to an undisclosed location assumed to be
            Nancy�s house, but nothing is ever said. The walls are too thin for
            voices to be raised. We are like a family of Trappists, cloistered
            in our own silences. I can�t be much of an elder brother to my
            siblings. I�m sure they�re as confused as I am, because when I�m not
            actually missing from the house, I�m just emotionally absent, for
            although I love them dearly, and I think they love me, I can�t
            really express any interest in them or risk any emotion. They must
            think I�m a cold fish, but I have no idea what they know or what
            they can tolerate. I share a back bedroom with my brother and a view
            of the ocean--that is, it has a view of the ocean if you climb on
            top of the wardrobe and peer over the rooftops, and there in the
            distance will be the gray, forbidding horizon of the North Sea. I
            get out as much as I can. I will use up whole days wandering up and
            down the beaches from Tynemouth to Whitley Bay, drifting with the
            tides, aimlessly walking and thinking.<BR><BR>I begin to spend a lot
            of my evenings at the YMCA in Whitley Bay, and befriend two
            brothers, Ken and Pete Brigham. Ken, like me, goes to a grammar
            school in Newcastle. He is an excellent musician and plays piano and
            guitar. Pete, who is a couple of years older than we are, is an
            apprentice chef and plays the bass. Pete has actually built this
            instrument himself, and I am stunned by his ingenuity. The bass is
            functional without being crude, utilitarian without being ugly. He
            explains to me the electronic mysteries of the -single--coil pickup,
            the mathematics of scale length and the crucial distances between
            the frets on the fingerboard. This will be my first introduction to
            the cult of the bass guitar. I have not really taken much interest
            in the instrument, regarding myself exclusively as a lead guitarist
            because I could now make passable attempts at Hendrix riffs, using
            this new skill to inveigle my way into the coterie of young
            musicians who gather in the music room most weeknights. I am the kid
            who can play �Purple Haze,� and this becomes my calling card. From
            such small beginnings reputations are made. I probably teach that
            riff to half the kids in the YM.<BR>One of these kids is Keith
            Gallagher, who will be the best man at my wedding, as I will be at
            his. A lifelong friend and an early supporter, it is with his
            enthusiasm encouragement that I dare to imagine that I have
            something that sets me apart as a musician, that somehow the dream
            can be nurtured into reality.<BR><BR>Keith has a practical nature.
            He is apprenticed to an engineering firm in Newcastle and attends
            night school. He also had the ambition and tenacity to get a good
            degree and eventually become a leading consultant engineer. Although
            my convoluted route to success will be far less structured, we must
            have recognized in each other similar traits, similar desires to
            escape the confined world of our parents. We walk the beaches
            together, talking and fantasizing, sometimes until the early hours
            of the morning. Keith is the first person to hear my early
            songwriting efforts, and although they are probably awful, he shows
            just enough interest to encourage me to carry on. (He did remind me
            recently that one of my earliest efforts concerned a flower in the
            desert. I had long forgotten this before I came to write a song
            called �Desert Rose,� which would sell over a million copies
            -thirty--five years later. It still seems fantastic to me that
            something as private as a song can become public property, but maybe
            all it takes is just one person to believe in what you are doing to
            give you the confidence to keep trying.)<BR><BR>While Keith is my
            Svengali it is Ken, the younger of the Brigham brothers, who will be
            my mentor. We learn old Freddie King numbers like �The Stumble� and
            �Hide Away� note for note, and play these tunes ad nauseam. Brother
            Pete plods away on the bass while Ken and I wheedle and deedle our
            way through the blues. We go to see Peter Green in Fleetwood Mac,
            Stan Webb in Chicken Shack, and John Mayall�s Bluesbreakers, feeding
            our fantasies that we too can become bluesmen. When we aren�t
            playing in the YM we are practicing up in Ken�s bedroom, which is in
            the attic of a Victorian terraced house near the seafront. One night
            Pete has a date and won�t be able to do the honors on bass, so I
            nobly volunteer to take up the support role while Ken wheedles and
            deedles.<BR><BR>The bass feels strange in your hands when you�ve
            been used to the smaller instrument with its narrow strings and
            short neck. The bass has a weight and a heft to it that feels like a
            weapon, yet there is a quiet beauty to it as well. This instrument
            is the root of all harmony, the bedrock at the bottom of the stave
            upon which music is constructed. When I accompanied Ken, I realized
            that whatever he played was harmonically defined by the notes on the
            bass. If he were to play the upper partials of a C chord on the
            guitar, it would only be a C chord if I played C in the bass. So I
            began to form in my mind what I can only describe as a strategy. A
            vague one, but nonetheless a strategy that the bass, while being far
            from flashy, would suit the covert side of my personality much
            better than the guitar. It would be a quieter heroism I would seek,
            stoic and grounded like my father�s. My ambitions would become
            concrete from the ground up, hidden yet effective. I would suppress
            my desire to shine spectacularly in favor of digging deep and
            marking time in what I somehow knew would become a lifelong
            campaign.
