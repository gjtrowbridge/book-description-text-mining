            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>CHAPTER
              ONE</strong><br>
              <br>
              &quot;Sift the sand to find the seeds of the universe.&quot;<br>
              </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              The voice that came to Shan Tao Yuri through the night was like
              wind over grass. &quot;Let them reach the original ground then plant
              them,&quot; the lama said as Shan's gaze drifted from the white
              sand in his palm to the brilliant half moon. He knew his teacher
              Gendun meant Shan's original ground, the seedbed of his soul, what
              Gendun called Shan's beginning place. But on such a night he could
              not shake the sense that Tibet itself was the true original ground,
              that the vast remote land was the world's beginning place, where
              the planet, and humankind, never stopped shaping themselves, where
              the highest mountains, the strongest winds, and the most rugged
              souls had always evolved together.<br>
              <br>
              Ten feet farther down the river's edge Shan's old friend and former
              cellmate Lokesh chanted quietly, beads entwined in his fingers,
              his mantra almost indistinguishable from the rustle of the water.
              Shan breathed in the fragrant smoke of the juniper branches they
              had brought to burn at the water's edge and watched as a meteor
              flew over a low distant shimmering in the sky, the only hint of
              the snow-capped mountains that lined the horizon. It seemed he could
              reach out and touch the moon. If the earth had a place and a season
              for growing souls this was surely it, the chill moonlit spring of
              the high Tibetan wilderness.<br>
              <br>
              Shan watched as though from a distance as Gendun gently opened Shan's
              fingers and lifted his hand toward the moon, then lowered it and
              turned Shan's wrist to empty the sand into the small clay jar they
              had brought from their hermitage ten miles away.<br>
              <em><br>
              &quot;Lha gyal lo,&quot;</em> a voice murmured on Shan's opposite
              side. It was the caretaker of the hermitage, Shopo, his voice cracking
              with emotion. &quot;Victory to the gods.&quot; They had arrived
              at the river at dusk, and only now, after the lamas and Lokesh had
              spent two hours speaking with the nagas, the water deities, had
              Gendun decided Shan could begin collecting the special white sand.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Lha gyal lo!&quot; an excited voice echoed halfway up the
              slope behind them. It was one of the four <em>dropka</em>, Tibetan
              herders, who had escorted them to the river and now stood guard,
              nervously watching the darkened landscape. Gendun and Shopo were
              outlawed monks engaged in an outlawed ritual, and the patrols had
              grown aggressive.<br>
              <br>
              Without even sensing the movement, Shan found his hand back in the
              water, and when he lifted it out it was full of the white sand again.
              In the moonlight he saw Lokesh's eyes widen and gleam with excitement
              as, slowly repeating the motions Gendun had shown him, Shan washed
              the sand in the moonlight then emptied his palm into the jar.<br>
              <br>
              Gendun's face, worn smooth as a river stone, wrinkled with a smile.
              &quot;Each of the grains is the essence of a mountain,&quot; the
              lama said as Shan's hand dipped into the water once more, &quot;all
              that is left when the mountain has shed its husk.&quot; Shan had
              heard the words a dozen times during the past two months as they
              had ventured into the night to collect sands from places known only
              to Shopo and the herders. In their turn each of the vast peaks that
              lined the horizon would be reduced to such a grain, Gendun explained,
              and so it would be for all mountains, all continents, all planets.
              It would all end as it began, in such tiny seeds, and humankind
              in all its glory could never match the power reflected in a single
              grain. The words were a way of teaching impermanence, Shan knew,
              and of showing respect for the nagas from whom they borrowed the
              sand.<br>
              <br>
              Shan sensed a distant drumming noise in his ears and the moon seemed
              to edge even closer as he gathered another handful for the jar.
              His hand reached toward the clay jar then froze in midair as a frantic
              voice split the stillness.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;<em>Mik tada</em>! Watch out! Run!&quot; It was one of the
              dropka sentinels on the ridge above. &quot;The fire! Dowse the fire!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shan heard feet scrambling over the gravel of the slope above and
              looked up to see two men silhouetted in the moonlight, realizing
              in the same moment that the drumming was not in his head. It was
              a helicopter coming in low and fast, the way Public Security operated
              when raiding Tibetan camps.<br>
              <br>
              One of the guards, wearing a black wool cap, darted to the water's
              edge, futilely pulling on Lokesh's shoulder, then moving to Shan's
              side to tug on his collar. &quot;You have to go patch that god!&quot;
              the man shouted. &quot;We must flee!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shan let himself be pulled to his feet, his spine chilling as he
              looked first toward the helicopter, then at the lamas, who only
              smiled and continued their homage to the river. Gendun and Shopo
              were accustomed to risking imprisonment for simple acts of reverence.
              And though Shan and the dropka might be disturbed by the increased
              pressure from Public Security, there was only one mystery that ever
              concerned Gendun, the mystery of growing and strengthening souls.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;If it is Public Security they will drop soldiers over the
              ridge to surround us!&quot; the sentinel groaned as he kicked sticks
              from the small fire. &quot;They will have machine guns and devices
              to see in the night!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shan studied the man in the black cap warily. He had more than a
              mere herder's grasp of Chinese weapons and tactics. Shan suddenly
              realized that he had not seen the man before, that he had not been
              part of their escort.<br>
              <br>
              Gendun replied by raising a finger to his lips, then gestured toward
              the water. &quot;There are nagas,&quot; he observed quietly.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;The sand will be useless if you are arrested,&quot; Shan whispered,
              his hand on Gendun's shoulder.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;There are nagas,&quot; the lama repeated.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;It's only sand,&quot; the stranger argued, casting a tormented
              glance in the direction of the approaching helicopter. Public Security
              had its own ways of teaching impermanence.<br>
              <br>
              As Gendun turned back to the water Lokesh was suddenly at the stranger's
              side, pulling him away from the lama. &quot;We are creating something
              wonderful with that sand,&quot; Shan's old friend whispered, the
              white stubble of his whiskers glistening in the moonlight. He placed
              his hands on the man's shoulders to be sure the young Tibetan was
              listening and gazed into his face. &quot;When we are done,&quot;
              he explained in a solemn, confiding tone, &quot;it will change the
              world.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The man in the black cap illuminated an electric lantern and aimed
              the beam into Lokesh's face as if doubting he had heard the old
              Tibetan correctly, then, as the sound of the helicopter surged to
              a crescendo, he snapped off the light and dove to the ground. A
              moment later the machine was gone. It had skimmed the ridge above
              but had been traveling too fast to deploy troops.<br>
              <br>
              The man in the cap lit his lantern and muttered under his breath,
              casting an accusing glance at the other guards, who had gathered
              behind Lokesh with sheepish, even embarrassed expressions. He aimed
              the light beam into each man's face, settling it on Shan's, which
              he studied with a frown. &quot;You are supposed to be delivering
              an artifact,&quot; he said to Lokesh, his voice heavy with impatience.
              He did not move the light from Shan. &quot;We are,&quot; Lokesh
              agreed. &quot;We are preparing for the journey,&quot; he added with
              a gesture toward the two lamas, who continued to speak over the
              swift dark river.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Preparing?&quot; the man scoffed. &quot;What have you been
              doing for two months? You're not preparing, you're taking root!
              You will ruin us!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shan stepped beside Lokesh and pushed the man's lantern down.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Those who brought the artifact agreed that the lamas will
              decide the proper way to return it.&quot; He knew now the stranger,
              like those who had brought the sacred artifact to Shopo's hermitage,
              was a purba, a member of the secret Tibetan resistance.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;You mean Drakte agreed.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Drakte is one of you,&quot; Shan asserted. He and Lokesh had
              met Drakte nearly a year earlier aiding prisoners in the gulag camp
              where they had served. It had been Drakte who had intercepted them
              two months ago and taken them to Shopo's hidden hermitage. &quot;We
              will go when the lamas and Drakte are ready. He is coming to show
              us the way. A few more days at most.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;We don't have a few more days,&quot; the purba groused. &quot;And
              don't expect Drakte. He's not keeping his appointments.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Missing?&quot; Shan noticed a bulge under the man's jacket,
              at the waist, and looked back at Gendun. If the lamas thought the
              man had a gun they would insist he leave.<br>
              <br>
              The purba shrugged. &quot;Not where he was asked to be.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;And you've come in his place?&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;No. But I was hoping to find him at that hermitage. There
              is news. And I brought something he had asked for,&quot; he added
              in a peevish tone. &quot;He said the lamas needed it. He said if
              we did not agree to retrieve it he would go himself, all the way
              to India if necessary.&quot; The purba lowered a long, narrow sack
              from his shoulder and produced an eighteen-inch-long bamboo tube,
              which Lokesh eagerly accepted.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;What news?&quot; Shan asked.<br>
              <br>
              Before he replied the man pointed to one of the herders, then to
              the top of the hill where the guards had been watching the road
              beyond. The herder sprang up the slope. &quot;A man was killed.
              An official, in Amdo town,&quot; he said, referring to the closest
              settlement of any size, nearly a hundred miles away. &quot;Public
              Security will sweep the hills and detain people. When they interrogate,
              they will learn of the hermitage.&quot; He cast another frown toward
              the lamas. &quot;You may call it sacred, what you are doing, but
              they will call it a crime against the state.&quot; He took a step
              toward Gendun as though to try again to drag him away, but a herder
              in a fleece vest stepped forward with a hand raised in warning.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?&quot; The purba's
              hands clenched and unclenched repeatedly. He seemed ready to do
              battle with them. &quot;No one told us you would wander around the
              mountains like this. You could go to prison, all of you. For what?
              You can't fight the Chinese with sand and prayers.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Lokesh uttered a hoarse sound that Shan recognized as a laugh. &quot;I
              have known Chinese prisons,&quot; the old Tibetan said. &quot;Sometimes
              sand and prayers are the only way.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The purba fixed Shan with a bitter stare. &quot;You are the famous
              Chinese who fixes things for Tibetans. You know better, but still
              you let them do this.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shan paused to study Gendun and Shopo. &quot;If these lamas asked
              me to jump into this river with my pockets stuffed with rocks,&quot;
              he said quietly, &quot;I would thank them and leap in.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Llia gyal lo,&quot; the herder in the vest whispered, as if
              to cheer Shan on.<br>
              <br>
              Lokesh touched the warrior's arm. &quot;It is difficult for one
              so young to understand these things,&quot; the old Tibetan said.
              &quot;You should return with us to the hermitage and see.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &#8220;Unlike Drakte, I obey my orders,&quot; the man snapped. &quot;I
              am needed elsewhere.&#8221;<br>
              <br>
              Lokesh raised the bamboo tube in his hand. &quot;Then look now,&quot;
              he suggested, extracting a roll of cloth from the tube. As Lokesh
              straightened it Shan saw that it was an old <em>thangka</em>, one
              of the cloth paintings used to depict the icons of Tibetan Buddhism.<br>
              <br>
              When the purba's light hit the painting the man grimaced and retreated
              a step. One of the dropka guards moaned loudly. It was the image
              of a fierce demon, with the head of a bull garlanded with human
              skulls, surrounded by swords and spears and arrows, holding a cup
              of blood. The flayed skins of its victims lay at its feet. Lokesh
              studied the image with a satisfied grin, then motioned the purba
              forward.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Look carefully,&quot; the old Tibetan said, pointing to the
              head of the terrifying image. &quot;This is what we are doing. This
              is how we win without violence. This is how the artifact will be
              returned, how that deity is going to be repaired. Because this is
              what he is becoming.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Who?&quot; the purba asked, the anger in his voice now tinged
              with confusion.<br>
              <br>
              In the dim light Shan thought he saw surprise on Lokesh's face,
              as though the answer were obvious. Then Lokesh gestured from the
              skull-clad demon to Shan. &quot;Our friend. Our Shan.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The spell cast by the words silenced the purba and the dropka, all
              of whom stared uneasily at Shan. Shan searched Lokesh's face for
              an explanation, but his friend just grinned back expectantly, as
              if he had given Shan a great gift.<br>
              <br>
              Suddenly another desperate cry split the air. The guard at the top
              of the ridge frantically stumbled down the slope. &quot;A patrol!
              Knobs!&quot; he cried, meaning the soldiers of the Public Security
              Bureau. The purba and Shan leapt up and moments later gazed down
              at a troop transport half a mile away, edging its way slowly toward
              their position.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;That helicopter spotted us,&quot; the purba said. &quot;Last
              month they used infrared to find an old hermit who only came out
              at night to pray.&quot; Shan sensed the fierce determination rising
              in the warrior's voice and shuddered.<br>
              <br>
              At the river three of the dropka were in a cluster around the lamas,
              facing outward, as if preparing to engage the knobs with their staffs.
              The fourth, the man wearing the fleece vest, stood apart, staring
              into the black water. As the purba marched purposefully toward the
              lamas the herder in the vest spun about and hurled himself on the
              purba, shoving him to the ground, then just as abruptly pulling
              away. In his hand was a large automatic pistol.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;You fool!&quot; the purba spat. &quot;They have to be taken
              away! We can't fight those knobs.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Shame crossed the herder's face as he looked at the pistol in his
              hand, and he held the weapon clumsily, fingers around only the grip,
              not touching the trigger. &quot;You see that one,&quot; he said,
              nodding toward Gendun, who still communed with the river. &quot;My
              mother stays at that tent by the hermitage. She calls him the Pure
              Water Lama. You know why? Not just because he never registered with
              the bastards at the Bureau of Religious Affairs, but because he
              took his vows more than fifty years ago, before the invasion. Before
              the Chinese scoured our land and changed it forever. He has never
              gone into exile, never been captured. His words are uncontaminated,
              my mother says, because they flow from a stream the Chinese never
              discovered.&quot; The man spoke slowly, with a tone of wonder, as
              if he had forgotten the knob patrol. Beside him two of the herders
              knelt at the river and began collecting pebbles.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;I need my gun,&quot; growled the purba, still sprawled on
              the ground. He was scared, Shan saw. Sometimes traditional Tibetans
              hated the purbas as much as the Chinese. &quot;We need to get them
              out of here.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The herder shook his head. &quot;I have never done anything with
              my life,&quot; he said in a hollow voice. &quot;The Chinese would
              not let me go to school. They wouldn't let me travel. They wouldn't
              let me get a job. I'm like a little stunted tree that can never
              grow, and that one, the Pure Water Lama, he is like the towering
              survivor of a forest where everything else was leveled.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              He cast a smile toward Gendun, then looked at the purba, his face
              hardening. &quot;Here is how we protect such men,&quot; he said,
              and he threw the gun into the black water. The two herders at the
              river's edge rose and stepped to his side, pulling slings from their
              pockets. &quot;We have heard how to do this from others. We will
              smash their searchlights and fill the air with stones. If we are
              lucky they will not see us. Chinese soldiers get scared in the night.
              They hear stories of demons.&quot; He glanced at the thangka, still
              in Lokesh's hand, then at Shan. &quot;The lamas must fill the jar,&quot;
              he said to the purba, &quot;and then you will take them back. My
              younger brother knows the way,&quot; he said, gesturing toward the
              remaining herder. &quot;If we do not stop the patrol, you are the
              one who best knows how to evade the soldiers.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              When the man lifted his sling his hand shook. &quot;Patch the deity,&quot;
              he said in a rushed whisper to Shan, then faded into the shadows
              with his companions.<br>
              <br>
              As Shan helped the purba to his feet the man looked into the darkness,
              in the direction the herders had gone, a mixture of anger and awe
              on his face. &quot;That artifact,&quot; he said in a hollow voice,
              &quot;I hear it's just a little piece of stone.&quot;</font></p>
