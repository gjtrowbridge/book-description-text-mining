<p>"Our sister is marrying a vampire," Portia announced.</p>

<p>"That's nice, dear," Caroline murmured, making
another neat notation in the open ledger on
the writing desk.</p>

<p>She'd long ago learned to ignore her seventeen-year-old sister's rioting imagination and penchant
for drama. She couldn't afford to abandon her responsibilities
every time Portia spotted a werewolf
sniffing around the trash heap or fell back upon
the sofa in a semiswoon and announced that she
was coming down with the Black Plague.</p>

<p>"You must write Aunt Marietta immediately
and insist that she send Vivienne home to us before
it's too late. We're her only hope, Caro!"</p>

<p>Caroline glanced up from the column of numbers,
surprised to find her baby sister looking
genuinely distressed. Portia stood in the middle
of the dusty parlor, clutching a letter in one trembling
hand. Her dark blue eyes looked stricken and her normally rosy cheeks were as pale as if
some cloaked fiend had already sucked all the
blood from her tender young heart.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you going on about now?"
Her concern growing, Caroline laid aside her pen
and slipped off the stool. She'd been hunched
over the writing desk for nearly three hours,
struggling to find some creative way to subtract
the monthly expenses from their household accounts
without making the final tally add up to
less than zero. Shrugging the tension from her
shoulders, she pried the letter from her sister's
hand. "Surely it can't be as grim as all that. Let me
have a look."</p>

<p>Caroline immediately recognized their middle
sister's flowery scrawl. Brushing a pesky strand of
pale blond hair from her eyes, she quickly scanned
the letter, skipping over the endless descriptions of
tulle-draped ball gowns and sprightly curricle
rides down Rotten Row in Hyde Park. It didn't
take her long to hone in on the passage that had
drained all the color from Portia's face.</p>

<p>"My my," she murmured, arching one eyebrow.
"After only a month in London it appears our
Vivienne has already acquired a suitor."</p>

<p>Caroline refused to recognize the familiar pang
in her heart as envy. When their aunt Marietta
had offered to sponsor Vivienne's debut, it had
never occurred to Caroline to point out that her
own Season had been indefinitely postponed
when their parents had perished in a carriage accident on the very eve of her introduction to
court. And Caroline had soundly dismissed those
same pangs when Vivienne departed for London
with a trunk packed with all of the beautiful
things their mother had chosen for her own postponed
debut. It was a waste of valuable time to
mourn a past that could never be changed, a
dream that could never be realized. Besides, at
four-and-twenty, Caroline was now so firmly entrenched
on the shelf that it would take an earthquake
to dislodge her.</p>

<p>"A suitor? Amonster, you mean!" Portia peered
over Caroline's shoulder, one of her sable ringlets
tickling Caroline's cheek. "Did you fail to note the
blackguard's name?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary. Vivienne has transcribed it in
her boldest hand with a number of lovingly lavish
embellishments." Caroline grimaced at the
second page. "Good heavens, did she actually dot
the i with a heart?"</p>

<p>"If the mere whisper of his name doesn't strike
terror in your own heart, then you must be unaware
of his reputation."</p>

<p>"I am now." Caroline continued to scan the letter.
"Our sister has thoughtfully provided a most
extensive catalogue of his charms. From her glowing
recitation, one can assume the gentleman's list
of virtues is rivaled only by the Archbishop of
Canterbury's."</p>

<p>"While she was extolling the fine cut of his neckcloth
and his many kindnesses to widows and orphans, I don't suppose she bothered to mention the
fact that he's a vampire."</p>

<p>Caroline rounded on her sister, her scant patience
evaporating. "Oh, come now, Portia. Ever
since you read that ridiculous tale by Dr. Polidori,
you've been seeing vampires lurking behind every
curtain and potted shrub. Had I known 'The
Vampyre' would seize your imagination in such a
ruthless grip, I'd have tossed the magazine on the
trash heap as soon as it arrived. Maybe one of the
werewolves you've spotted digging through the refuse
would have carried it off and buried it."</p>

<p>Drawing herself up to her full five feet and two
inches, Portia sniffed. "Everyone knows that Dr.
Polidori didn't write that story. Why, he himself
admitted to publishing it on behalf of his most famous
patient -- one George Gordon, Lord Byron
himself!"</p>

<p>"A claim which Byron staunchly denied, I
should remind you."</p>

<p>"Can you blame him? How could he do otherwise
when the ruthless and brooding character of
Ruthven was only a thinly disguised version of
himself? He can deny it all he likes, but 'The
Vampyre' revealed his true nature for all the
world to see."</p>

<p>Caroline sighed, a vein in her temple beginning
to throb. "His true nature being that of a bloodsucking
creature of the night, I presume?"</p>

<p>"How can anyone doubt it after reading The
Giaour?" Portia's eyes took on a distant sheen Caroline knew only too well. Lifting a hand and striking
a suitably dramatic stance, Portia intoned:</p>

<blockquote>

<em>"But first, on earth as Vampire sent,<br />
Thy corpse shall fall from its tomb be rent:<br />
Then ghastly haunt thy native place,<br />
And suck the blood of all thy race:<br />
There from the daughter, sister, wife,<br />
At midnight drain the stream of life."</em>
</blockquote>

<p>As Portia's voice faded on a suitably ominous
note, Caroline massaged her throbbing temple
with two fingers. "That doesn't prove Byron is a
vampire. It only proves that he, like every other
great poet, is on occasion capable of spouting momentous
drivel. I can only hope you have more
substantial evidence to convict Vivienne's new
suitor. If not, I shall have to assume this is just like
the time you shook me awake before dawn and
insisted that a family of fairies was living beneath
one of the toadstools in the garden ...
