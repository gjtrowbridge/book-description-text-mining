                  name=excerpt></A></FONT><B><FONT face=Verdana
                  size=2>Excerpt:</FONT></B></P>
                  <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>INTERVAL
                  <P align=left><I>At first there is no road. It�s only when a
                  person begins it that it exists for others.</I></P>
                  <P align=left>What follows is very much true. Beginning with
                  I�ve never read anything I�ve written. Not after it�s been
                  published. Not once. Not ever.</P>
                  <P align=left>Not so with Ron.</P>
                  <P align=left>He�s been known to visit with our pages from
                  time to time, preparing for an appearance, lecture, or
                  interview.&nbsp;<BR>He has even read passages aloud when
                  invited to do so. Never minding, glad to oblige, gracious --
                  always that, so much so a gent, that�s Ron. But that�s not me.
                  Can�t do it.</P>
                  <P align=left>Oh, I read and reread what I�ve put down during
                  the keyboard-clacking process of writing a book. Ceaselessly
                  shaping and shading. Striving for the right word in the right
                  place. Wondering what works, what doesn�t, trying very hard to
                  make the concepts Ron and I have developed interesting and
                  inspiring -- thought-connecting, too. Always hoping that it is
                  written well, praying that it is accepted well. Blissfully
                  happy that after so many months that something exists. Mostly
                  terrified that once it�s polished and put out there for public
                  view, that each day that dawns, zero people on planet Earth
                  will care. Just another vestigial waste of pulp, lost on the
                  bookseller�s shelf, gasping for air, of interest to no one.
                  (Pssst! While you snore with happiness, this is the nightmare
                  of all writers, the sort of madness that haunts our dreams the
                  most.)</P>
                  <P align=left>Closing in, this is not a confidence thing.
                  Hardly. Hold me upside down and give me a good shake and
                  believe me, confidence will pour out of my ears. But still, I
                  pretty much never begin a page without cursing my lack of
                  talent, or end one successfully dodging my helplessness.
                  Because regardless of what happens later, no matter how much
                  sales are going good, the books booming, pleasing the
                  publisher and giddying those that own their stock, no matter
                  how kind and assuring the plaudits and reviews, I long ago
                  realized something, which in the interest of accuracy, I will
                  share with you now. Shhh . . .&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>I could have done better.</P>
                  <P align=left>This is the torment I keep inside. My inner
                  reality. That the ideas and intellections that were so golden
                  in my mind back when, the thoughts that were winged with such
                  purpose and passion, when they circle and land, becoming ink
                  on paper, in part of my head I know that I could have done,
                  well, just so much better. That�s where my mind goes spinning
                  away to hide when I think about my writing.</P>
                  <P align=left>Denigrating further, I have no problem sharing
                  with you yet another of my nutball lunacies, which is the fear
                  that many, most, who might turn to our books for guidance,
                  inspiration, or enlightenment would discover the experience to
                  be nothing more than an aberration, and that�s the panic I
                  live with regardless of their praise unending.</P>
                  <P align=left>So again, since I don�t much care for my
                  writing, I�ve never read anything I�ve written. Not after it�s
                  been published. Not once. Not ever. Because even though no one
                  will ever know how hard I slaved, always, always turning in
                  only my best work, wanting whatever I write to have as much
                  quality as possible, I know in my heart of hearts that I could
                  have done better. And how do I deal with such bedeviled
                  expectation? Easy.</P>
                  <P align=left>As a Zentrepreneur, I not only know that I can
                  always do better -- I believe it. And understand this:
                  Believing is a Zentrepreneur�s most prized possession.</P>
                  <P align=left>While some live the life they�ve been given,
                  Zentrepreneurs live the life they believe in.&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>For that is what Zentrepreneurs are: believers
                  who believe in living a life in which what they do is one with
                  what they are. Pursuing their passion for the possible,
                  perceiving a clarity of purpose, Zentrepreneurs endeavor to
                  study and practice, to live a life where the creative spark,
                  the inner illumination of spirit, talent, and uniqueness, is
                  put into motion, fostering growth that not only enriches their
                  own life, but the lives of others as well. But more than that,
                  Zentrepreneurs have made their lives noble and rich beyond
                  counting by living a dream defined. Exuberantly so. And how do
                  they get to a place of such happiness and light, where they
                  have the courage and commitment to follow their feelings and
                  live a life where they can take charge, create, and do? By
                  simply doing no less than one thing only --</P>
                  <P align=left>Believing they can.&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>Which is what we all need to do. All of us. All
                  of the time.</P>
                  <P align=left>This book was born of a belief that every time
                  someone finds his or her own way, he or she paves the way for
                  someone else. That to journey our best life we need only to
                  begin on a path of enlightenment, but realize, please, that
                  the path to achieving your deserved greatness cannot be
                  taught, it must be taken. Only then can illumination be
                  delivered.</P>
                  <P align=left>Enter Federal Express.</P>
                  <P align=left>There is a profound Japanese proverb that
                  states: �To teach is to learn.� I learned a tremendously
                  meaningful lesson one fortuitous mid-morning, beginning
                  innocently enough, with a package that came to me that day. At
                  first, the contents were common enough. A book. One of ours. A
                  very well-worn Zentrepreneur�s Guide with just the most
                  beautiful note along with. </P>
                  <P align=left>Here it is, verbatim.</P>
                  <P align=left><I>Dear Ron and Stuart</I>,&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left><I>Blessings to you for writing this book. I
                  could never express how wonderful, good and true your
                  teachings, inspiration and advice have been and continue to be
                  for me. Your words have given me the life-enhancing
                  encouragement to take the steps I have been wanting to take
                  for years. It could have never come along at a better time in
                  my life and I refer to the pages on a daily basis. (Note the
                  extensive use of yellow highlighter. The book�s condition due
                  to my reading it over and over while working out on a
                  treadmill.) It would mean just so much if you could both take
                  the time to sign this for me. I wish there were more people
                  like you in this world to teach us to live our passion and our
                  dreams and not to look back. Your empowering words of wisdom
                  have changed me and I will carry them with me throughout my
                  journeys in life.</I></P>
                  <P align=left>Well, now. I don�t know what you might think
                  after reading such a letter, so thoughtful and sincere, and
                  thank you very much, but I can tell you how it triggered Ron
                  and me.</P>
                  <P align=left>Blew us away.</P>
                  <P align=left>And want to know what? This marvelous incident
                  permanently altered my view, forcing me, for the first time,
                  surprisingly and stunningly to read a few of the jottings I�ve
                  put down, not only with fresh eyes, but more importantly,
                  through the eyes of another.&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>And want to know what else? The way this person
                  had descended on the pages of the book, embracing them,
                  isolating so many passages with such obvious focus and
                  satisfying belief, the luminous flash of yellow highlighter
                  holding them bright to the light, the way it was done, I
                  realized she had to be serious when she said the encounter
                  with our words had changed her.</P>
                  <P align=left>Changed me, too.&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>Enough to look back a bit at some of the stuff
                  I�ve written, the climactic moment, alas, not too terrible,
                  the excursion allowing me to recognize something that, trapped
                  in my own skin, I could not see before -- the unimportance of
                  trying to build a church out of my words. I was confusing
                  content with contentment, missing the true whisper of the
                  words that within the stillness spoke a message as old as the
                  world: By doing something that may help to change the
                  circumstances of others, we help to change the circumstances
                  of ourselves.&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>This book is about change. More to the point, it
                  is a book about the ultimate dynamic of life, your innate
                  capacity to change your circumstance, perspective, and
                  direction, indeed the power that is yours to become the change
                  you wish to be. It is our fervent hope that this gathering of
                  Wowisms -- these proverbs of possibility -- will ennoble your
                  spirit, initiate your mind, and encourage an awakening that
                  engages and guides. you to embrace your fullest essence and
                  unlimited potential. Change is the elixir of life. Open
                  yourself to the wow and the wonder -- the renewal it can bring
                  -- remembering always, please, that you get the life that you
                  allow. And so, as we get started, let me say, may you all
                  become dreamers and doers and may you also remember this:
                  While some books change the way you think, some books change
                  the way you live. Either way . . .&nbsp;</P>
                  <P align=left>Over to you.</P>
