<p>Bitterroot Mountains, Montana<p>November<p> <p> He's going  to kill you.<p> Right here in the middle of this snow-covered God-forsaken valley,  he's going to kill you! Fight, Wendy, fight!<p> Wendy Ito struggled, battling  with the ropes that cut into her bare flesh, feeling the sting of a fierce arctic  wind as it howled through the mountain ridges that surrounded them. <p> She was  alone. Aside from the psychopath who had captured her.<p> God, why had she trusted  him?<p> How in the world had she thought that he was her rescuer? That his mission  was to heal her until, after the blizzard, he could call for help or take her  to the nearest hospital?<p> Had it been his sincere concern as he'd come  upon her wrecked car? Had it been those blue, blue eyes? His smile? His soft words  of assurance? Or had it been because she'd had no choice, without his aid  she would surely die alone in a deep, forgotten ravine?<p> Whatever the reason  she'd believed him, trusted him.<p> Fool! Idiot!<p> He'd proved himself  to be her worst nightmare, an evil wolf in sheep's clothing and now, oh,  God, now she was paying the price.<p> Shivering, certain she would die, she was  naked and lashed to a tree, the thick rope cutting into her bare arms and torso,  a gag so tight over her lips that she could barely breathe.<p> And he was close.  So close she could feel the warmth of his breath sifting around the trunk of the  sturdy pine, hear him grunt as he put all his strength into securing her, see  a flash of white neoprene ski pants and parka from the corner of her eye.<p>  Another tug on the rope.<p> She gasped, her whole body jerked even tighter against  the scaly bark of the tree. Pain shot through her and she set her jaw. She just  needed him to get close enough that she could kick hard. Hit his shin. Or his  nuts. <p> She couldn't let him get away with this. Wouldn't! <p> Her  heart raced and she tried to come up with a way to save herself, to break free  of her bonds and climb up the snow-covered deer trail he'd dragged her down.  Oh, she'd fought him. Wriggling and fighting, flinging herself at him, trying  someway to free herself, to avoid being brought down here to whatever fate he'd  planned. She could still see the fresh tracks in the thick snow. His steady, evenly-placed  big boot prints and her smaller, wild, erratic barefoot scrambles as she'd  tried to get away, even though he'd prodded her with his damned knife and  there were drips of blood in the white snow, proving that he'd cut her, that  he'd meant business.<p> Dear God, help me, she silently prayed to the gun-metal  gray heavens threatening more snow.<p> He laced the restraining ropes ever tighter.  <p> "No!" Wendy tried to scream. "No! No! No!" But the foul  gag covered her mouth and kept her cries muffled and weak while the panic surging  through her blood caused her heart to thunder. Why? Oh, God, why me?<p> She blinked  back tears but felt the salty drops fall from her eyes to stain and freeze upon  her cheeks.<p> Don't cry. Whatever you do, do not let him see that you fear  him. Don't give the son of a bitch the satisfaction. But don't fight  either, pretend to give up, fake it and act like you've accepted your fate.  Maybe his guard will slip and you can somehow get hold of his damn knife.<p>  Her stomach clenched even tighter and she tried to keep his weapon, a hunting  knife used for the gutting of game, in her sights. Razor sharp, it could slice  through the ropes easily. Just as easily as it could pierce and cut her flesh.<p>  Oh, God . . .<p> Her knees went weak and it was all she could do not to bawl  and beg, to mewl and plead, to offer to do anything he wanted if he would just  not hurt her.<p> Go ahead, let him see that you're resigned to your fate  . . . but keep your eye on the knife with its menacing, deadly blade.<p> She  was shivering harder now. Shaking so violently that slivers from the bark were  digging into her skin. Was she trembling because of the bitter, Montana wind,  gusts she was certain where blowing down from Canada and the arctic? Or was she  quivering from the fear that tore at her insides? <p> Beneath the gag her teeth  chattered and she felt the raw wind buffet her as he worked. She caught glimpses  of his legs warmed by thick hunting socks and the white ski pants, his heavy,  fur-lined parka protecting him from the very elements to which she was exposed.<p>  This lying son of a bitch had no intention of saving you, of healing your wounds  after the horrible car wreck. All along the sick bastard only kept you alive,  citing the storm as a reason he couldn't get help, only to kill you. In the  time he wanted. In the manner he wanted. He was savoring the anticipation while  you half fell in love with him.<p> Bile rose up her throat and she nearly wretched  at the thought. He'd known it. She'd seen it in his eyes, that he'd  read her utter dependency, her silly, stupid and pathetic desire to please him.<p>  If she could, she'd kill him.<p> Right here. Right now.<p> She heard him  grunt again, as if satisfied as he pulled the taut rope even tighter, forcing  her buttocks into the sharp bark, her shoulders to be held fast. She could still  kick, but he kept himself far from the damage she might inflict. Even with one  leg still sore from the accident she thought she could wound, and wound badly,  because of all her training in martial arts.<p> But he was careful to stay on  the far side of the tree and keep away from her heels. And the cold was beginning  to take its toll. She had trouble focusing, thinking of anything but the ice in  her flesh, the sheer frigidity settling in her bones.<p> Blackness pulled at  her vision.<p> Each breath she drew was labored and thin, her lungs on fire from  lack of oxygen.<p> Maybe unconsciousness would be the way out. The blackness  was soothing, taking the sting out of the wind.<p> But then she saw him move,  so that he was in front of her, staring at her with his cruel, relentless gaze.<p>  How had she ever thought him handsome? How had she ever fantasized about him,  how had she ever considering making love to him?<p> Slowly he removed the knife  from his belt. Its cruel metallic surface winked in the shifting gray light.<p>  She was doomed.<p> She knew it.<p> Even before he slowly, inexorably raised  the blade. <P>
