<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;</font></span><font color="#000000" size="2"><B>The day after she was supposed to have
		been married, Kira Fitzgerald sat with her back to her desk at the
		Pickering Foundation, systematically and symbolically ridding herself of
		the dick-wad she�d caught screwing her sister.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 align="left" style="text-align:left;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
		<b>
		<font size="2" color="#000000">She emptied her purse of
		anything that reminded her of the jock.&nbsp; Then she tossed the debris into
		her metal trashcan with gratifying force, and broke a tiny but expensive
		vial of his favorite perfume with great satisfaction.&nbsp; She took each of
		the addressed, ecru parchment wedding invitations she'd been saving to
		torture herself, and tossed them as
		well.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		Taking this job as Pickering's Coordinator of Special Events had been a first step in
		rising from the ashes of her life.&nbsp; Performing this spell was the
		second.&nbsp; She�d turn everything that reminded her of the snake into ashes
		as well.</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		She added a pinch of healing herbs from
		her pouch, lit a long tapered match, and touched it to the edges of her
		shattered dreams.&nbsp; �I hate jocks!�&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		As number of pearl embossed calla
		lilies, and ridiculous, romantic words began to singe and curl, Kira
		raised her amethyst-tipped wand, tempted to give the jerk what he really
		deserved.&nbsp; �I wanna wither your Charlie, Penis!�&nbsp; But like any witch
		worthy of the title, she would harm none.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		Kira wielded her wand with a flourish.</font></b></h3>

		<font size="2">Whoosh!</font></u><font size="2">&nbsp;
		The fire flared to bright and vigorous life, releasing a sickly-sweet
		scent into the air.&nbsp; �Shit!�&nbsp; She�d forgotten perfume was flammable.</font></font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="line-height:normal"><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
		flames and the flowery smoke rose, Kira grabbed her consolation bouquet
		from beside her computer, rescued the yellow roses, poured the water on
		the fire, and doused the small inferno.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="line-height:normal"><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was
		when she saw the crisp blue vellum invitation atop her stack of mail,
		sitting there, free of its envelope, mocking her.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Cripes, not another wedding.�&nbsp; She

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">

		�Damn!� came a deep, sexy voice, �I

		<h3 style="line-height:normal">
		<b>
		<font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kira yelped and whipped about to gape at
		the hunk of manhood who�d materialized behind her, her heart beating
		double time.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="line-height:normal">
		<b>
		<font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long had he been standing there?&nbsp;

		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		He made her think of a wolf, hungry yet
		calm, every nuance of his aquiline features sharp, like the gleam in his
		silver-gray eyes, and the disapproving dimple cut deep in the center of
		his chin.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		Like a lazy predator, he leaned against
		the connecting doorjamb between her office and the next, arms crossed,
		sculpted lips firm, an antique walking stick at his side.&nbsp;
		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		Kira�s heart shifted into overdrive.&nbsp;
		For half a beat, she thought he was gorgeous, flawless, but no.&nbsp; He
		needed a haircut, a bump spoiled the precision of his nose, and his
		square chin bore a decidedly stubborn set, not to mention that
		five-o�clock shadow at eleven in the morning.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		The small scar that crossed his left
		brow intrigued her, but his lips�too perfect for a man�seemed carved in
		granite, and the orgasmic promise in his eyes should come with a warning
		label.&nbsp; Nevertheless, all the odd parts formed such an attractive whole,
		Kira had to catch her breath and rub her arms against a sudden chill.&nbsp;
		�How long have you been standing there?� </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Long enough to be glad my name�s not
		Charlie.� </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Shit!�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Nice talk.&nbsp; Little hormone problem
		going on there?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		Kira bristled.&nbsp; �Little attitude problem
		going on there?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Sorry, geez but that penis talk was
		seriously-scary.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent:.5in"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">
		�Who are you?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="line-height:normal"><b><font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The intruder extended his hand with a grin that made her wonder why his
		teeth weren�t sharp.&nbsp; �I�m the new Director of Special Events,� he
		said.&nbsp; �And you?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="line-height:normal"><b><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just call me screwed.</i>&nbsp; �Kira Fitzgerald,�
		she said, an empty vase in one hand, and dripping roses in the other.&nbsp;

		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">She placed the flowers
		in the vase, glanced behind her at her smoking trashcan, and opened the
		window above it.&nbsp; Then she wiped her hands on the skirt of her smocked
		tube dress, glad it was black, and eyed her matching blazer with
		yearning.&nbsp; �I�m the Coordinator of Special Events,� she said.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Son of a . . . I mean,
		glad to meet you.�&nbsp; The wolf warmed her with his sweeping glance, and
		when she took his offered hand across her desk, the heat his gaze had
		ignited escalated.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">He let her hand go so
		fast, she thought he might have felt the burn as well.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I guess . . . you�re my
		new boss.�&nbsp; Kira took her blazer from the back of her chair and slipped
		into it.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�You guessed right,� he
		said.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I�ve been alone in this
		office for weeks,� she said.&nbsp; �I didn�t expect�� </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Not last week, you
		weren�t.&nbsp; I started last week.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Well no, I was on . . .
		vacation last week.&nbsp; Personal stuff . . . to settle.�&nbsp; Like finally
		getting her things from the Penis�s apartment.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Her hot new boss waited,
		for more of an explanation, Kira supposed, but she�d rather not
		elaborate.&nbsp; �I wouldn�t have cast�&nbsp; I mean, I thought I was alone or. .
		. �&nbsp; She pointed over her shoulder and down toward the trashcan.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Ah. . . .�&nbsp; He winced.&nbsp;
		�Is the Penis begoned forever?�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Nah.&nbsp; I�m sure he�s
		screwing somebody.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Okaaayyy.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira bit her lip and
		shifted her stance.&nbsp; �Anything in particular you�d like me to . . .
		coordinate this morning?� </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Now that you ask.�&nbsp; Her
		boss gave her another deadly wolf grin, but fortunately for her, she�d
		mastered the art of hunk-resistance. </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I don�t suppose you
		could scare up a few ghosts for Rainbow�s Edge,� he said.&nbsp; �You know,
		say something that rhymes, and twirl that . . . thing in the air, the
		way you . . . toasted . . . Charlie.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Do you honestly believe
		in magic?� Kira asked.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Threaten one penis and
		a guy will believe about anything you tell him.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira bit her lip,
		refusing to be charmed.&nbsp; �Did you have this invitation printed?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Seemed like a good idea
		at the time,� the hunk said.&nbsp; �How do you know Rainbow�s Edge doesn�t
		have any ghosts?�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I�ve read histories on
		all our mansions.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">He tilted his head.&nbsp;
		�Maybe you need to get a life?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira slapped her palm
		with the invitation.&nbsp; <i>Bite me</i>, she thought.&nbsp; �Good thing these
		haven�t been mailed yet.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Oh, but they have.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">She glanced at her desk
		calendar.&nbsp; �You ordered them before you started the job?&nbsp; What are you,
		some kind of overachiever?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I wanted to get a head
		start, but I didn�t mean to put you on the spot.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was
		assured that you could work, ahem, magic, and coordinate any event I
		thought would bring money into the foundation.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira thought about ways
		to put him on the spot to raise money for the foundation, like . . .
		selling him to the highest bidder.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Revenge for fun and profit.&nbsp;

		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">She smiled, and re-read
		the invite.&nbsp; �The phantom ghost is a problem, pun intended, though the
		event is perfect for All Hallows Eve.&nbsp; But if anybody�s willing to pay a
		grand to attend, which I seriously doubt, they�re gonna expect to meet
		this drive-by playboy, and I don�t think we can depend on him to show,
		even if he is Bessie�s��</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I see you two have
		met.�&nbsp; Bessie Pickering Hazard, Chairman of the Board, swept into Kira�s
		office, making for an awkward moment, as Kira had been about to trash
		her neglectful grandson.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I came down to perform
		the introductions,� Bessie said, �but no need, I see.�&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira and Bessie embraced
		like the friends they�d become in the past month, because it was Kira�s
		first day back after a week of overdue cancelled-wedding damage
		control.&nbsp; �I missed you, Bessie.&nbsp; How are you?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Glad to see you back.&nbsp;
		When you didn�t come home last night, I was worried.&nbsp; Everything okay?
		&nbsp;You okay?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�I drove down from
		Boston this morning,� Kira said.&nbsp; �Everything is . . . as expected.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�What do you mean, she
		didn�t come home last night?� the wolf asked with snapping eyes.&nbsp;
		�Gram?�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Gram?&nbsp; Kira felt herself
		go cold.&nbsp; She wished a vanishing spell existed that she could perform
		lickety-split.&nbsp; But she remained visible, if the focused glint in Mr.
		Tall, Dark and Incredible�s eyes was anything to go by.&nbsp; </font></b>
		</h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">No wonder she�d thought
		of him as a wolf; they called him an ice wolf in the news for pity�s
		sakes.&nbsp; Now that she knew who he was, she saw that his stance, his
		demeanor, belonged to every arrogant jock she�d ever encountered.&nbsp;
		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Come to think of it,
		hadn�t her ex looked up to this guy as some kind of role model�less for
		his skill on the ice than for his money, women, and cars, it was true,
		but what could you expect from a penis?&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Talk about your worst
		nightmare.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Didn�t I tell you?�
		Bessie said, with such innocence, Kira became as suspicious as her
		grandson.&nbsp; �I couldn�t pay Kira as much as I wanted,� she said, �so I
		gave her an apartment at Cloud Kiss, rent free, as a job benefit.&nbsp; She�s
		been with me for a month, now.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�No, you didn�t tell me,
		but I think you might have mentioned it before I sublet my condo and
		moved home.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Oh, no,� Kira said.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Oh, yes,� Goddard
		said.&nbsp; �It appears, Miss Fitzgerald--�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Ms. Fitzgerald.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Mizz Fitzgerald.&nbsp; It
		appears we�re neighbors, here and at home.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Bessie gave them an
		�isn�t this cozy?� smile, and Kira began to understand the wolf�s
		simmering anger.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�As a matter of fact,�
		Bessie said.&nbsp; �You�ll be sharing a kitchen.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Wait a minute,� the
		kitchen-sharers said as one, surprising Kira and making her stop and
		regard the jock, as he regarded her, with even greater mistrust if that
		were possible.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Bessie waved away their
		concern.&nbsp; �Don�t worry.&nbsp; It�s not like you�ll be tripping over each
		other.&nbsp; Neither of you bothers to cook.�&nbsp; She patted Kira�s hand.&nbsp; �The
		kitchen separates the suite.&nbsp; You�ll hardly know he�s there.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Oh, she�d know.&nbsp; They�d
		both know.&nbsp; After all, she�d insulted the hell out of him.&nbsp; Worse than
		that, ever since he�d opened his mouth, she�d had this hormone thing
		going on, like popcorn on high heat, which really pissed her off,
		because that made him right.&nbsp; She did have a hormone problem.&nbsp; </font>
		</b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">The fact was, if he
		caught her raiding the fridge at midnight�which she did in her sleep�she
		just might . . . pop.</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira gave herself a
		mental shake.&nbsp; According to The Penis, her new boss was the best
		Wizard�s goalie in thirty years, a wolf on and off the ice.&nbsp; Just what
		she needed, another jock in her life.&nbsp; A player.&nbsp; A man who collected
		women like loose change.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">And hadn�t Bessie said
		that this one had been named the best kisser in America or some such
		nonsense?&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Air.&nbsp; She needed air.&nbsp;
		She should have realized that the slash across his brow and the bump in
		his otherwise perfect nose meant that he�d been kissed by sticks and
		pucks as well as starlets.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Listen,� Kira said,
		raising her chin as she regarded him.&nbsp; �I didn�t know you were Bessie�s
		grandson.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�The fact that I�m
		Bessie�s grandson has no bearing on my ability to do my job!�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira stepped back.&nbsp;
		�Okay.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�And what�s with you?&nbsp;
		How could you not know?&nbsp; You don�t read the papers, watch TV?�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Not for sports or
		reality shows, I don�t.&nbsp; I like the movie channel.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�So you hate jocks and
		reality shows?� </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Damn, he had been there
		for a while.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Let�s get something
		straight,� he snapped, a miffed ice jockey in wolf mode shooting hard
		sparks of silver her way.&nbsp; �Whoever I�m related to, whatever I used to
		be, or will be again, by God, I�m on board right now to get The
		Pickering Foundation back on its feet, and while I�m here, I plan to
		work myself, and everyone else, to the bone.&nbsp; Are we clear on that?�&nbsp;

		</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Sure.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; No
		problem.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Glad to hear it.�&nbsp; The
		jock turned on his heel for a last-word exit, but he gasped, faltered,
		and grabbed his cane.&nbsp; So much for a spectacular retreat, Kira thought,
		wishing to hell she hadn�t witnessed it.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Gram,� he shouted.&nbsp; �My
		office.&nbsp; Now!�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Bessie winked at Kira.&nbsp;
		�Yes, dear.�&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Jason!� he snapped from
		his office.&nbsp; �You will call me Jason!&nbsp; No, maybe you should call me Mr.
		Goddard when I�m on the job, and I�ll call you Mrs. Hazard.�</font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Yes, dear.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Six months,� he said,
		with no less bite.&nbsp; �You have me for six months and not a day more.�</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">�Yes, dear,� Bessie said
		with a last grin for Kira before shutting herself into his office.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">If Kira hadn�t been so
		shaken, she might�ve laughed�so sweet and innocent had Bessie looked
		before facing the snarling wolf in his den.&nbsp; Snarling and angry with the
		world.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">But the closing click of
		that door had Kira covering her heart.&nbsp; Six months with eyes like his
		gazing down at her�as if in heated expectation . . . of . . . not what
		every other woman was willing to put out.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Would she be able to
		interact in a businesslike manner, in a sane manner, at least in the
		office, for six months on a daily basis with a man who looked like every
		girl�s fantasy?&nbsp; A man with the eyes of a predator, an irresponsible
		jock who�d been chased by, and slept with, every acclaimed beauty in the
		free world?&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira wasn�t certain, but
		no way could she bear the heat Goddard seemed to generate day and
		night.&nbsp; She didn�t know what his problem was: a personality clash, plain
		old dislike, the nepotism chip on his shoulder, or maybe it was her
		magic spell.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; It didn�t matter, because they were stuck
		working together, and they�d both best get over it.</font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">At least the electricity
		between them wasn�t sexual.&nbsp; She�d already failed that test.&nbsp; She didn�t
		have enough sex appeal to interest her own bridegroom, never mind a
		brazenly rich, sexy playboy jock.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>

		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">She knew by Goddard�s
		reputation, and by her ex�s praise, that the hockey wolf was the kind of
		cocky jerk who needed no more than to snap his fingers, or flash his
		smile, to get a woman into his bed.&nbsp; �Well not me, buddy.�&nbsp; </font></b>
		</h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">The man was spoiled�that
		was a headline-making fact�spoiled and rich, and so well put together
		that women followed him as if they were pups, and he had a bone in his
		pocket.&nbsp; </font></b></h3>
		<h3 style="text-indent: .5in"><b><font size="2">Kira clamped a hand over
		her mouth when she caught her pun.&nbsp; A pretty meaty bone, too, as far as
		she could tell.&nbsp; Made Charlie look like he kept a cocktail frank in his
		pants.</font></b></h3>
