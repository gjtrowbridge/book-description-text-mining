<font size="3"> The Council of Elders</font></font></p>

                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Saphira's
                              breathing quickened, and she opened her eyes, yawning
                              expansively. <em>Good morning, little one.</em>
                              </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>Is
                              it? </em>He looked down and leaned on his hands,
                              compressing the mattress. <em>It's terrible . .
                              . Murtagh and Ajihad . . . Why didn't sentries in
                              the tunnels warn us of the Urgals? They shouldn't
                              have been able to trail Ajihad's group without being
                              noticed. . . . Arya was right, it doesn't make sense.</em>
                              </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>We
                              may never know the truth</em>, said Saphira gently.
                              She stood, wings brushing the ceiling. <em>You need
                              to eat, then we must discover what the Varden are
                              planning. We can't waste time; a new leader could
                              be chosen within hours. </em></font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Eragon
                              agreed, thinking of how they had left everyone yesterday:
                              Orik rushing off to give King Hrothgar the tidings,
                              Jï¿½rmundur taking Ajihad's body to a place where
                              it would rest until the funeral, and Arya, who stood
                              alone and watched the goings-on. </font></span></p>

                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Eragon
                              rose and strapped on Zar'roc and his bow, then bent
                              and lifted Snowfire's saddle. A line of pain sheared
                              through his torso, driving him to the floor, where
                              he writhed, scrabbling at his back. It felt like
                              he was being sawed in half. Saphira growled as the
                              ripping sensation reached her. She tried to soothe
                              him with her own mind but was unable to alleviate
                              his suffering. Her tail instinctually lifted, as
                              if to fight. </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It
                              took minutes before the fit subsided and the last
                              throb faded away, leaving Eragon gasping. Sweat
                              drenched his face, making his hair stick and his
                              eyes sting. He reached back and gingerly fingered
                              the top of his scar. It was hot and inflamed and
                              sensitive to touch. Saphira lowered her nose and
                              touched him on the arm. <em>Oh, little one. . .
                              . </em></font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It
                              was worse this time, he said, staggering upright.
                              She let him lean against her as he wiped away the
                              sweat with a rag, then he tentatively stepped for
                              the door. </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>Are
                              you strong enough to go?</em></font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>We
                              have to. We're obliged as dragon and Rider to make
                              a public choice regarding the next head of the Varden,
                              and perhaps even influence the selection. I won't
                              ignore the strength of our position; we now wield
                              great authority written the Varden. At least the
                              Twins aren't here to grab the position for themselves.
                              That's the only good in the situation. </em></font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>Very
                              well, but Durza should suffer a thousand years of
                              torture for what he did to you. </em></font></span></p>

                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He
                              grunted. <em>Just stay close to me.</em> </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Together
                              they made their way through Tronjheim, toward the
                              nearest kitchen. In the corridors and hallways,
                              people stopped and bowed to them, murmuring, "Argetlam,"
                              or "Shadeslayer." Even dwarves made the motions,
                              though not as often. Eragon was struck by the somber,
                              haunted expressions of the humans and the dark clothing
                              they wore to display their sadness. Many women dressed
                              entirely in black, lace veils covering their faces.
                              </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In
                              the kitchen, Eragon brought a stone platter of food
                              to a low table. Saphira watched him carefully in
                              case he should have another attack. Several people
                              tried to approach him, but she lifted a lip and
                              growled sending them scurrying away. Eragon pretended
                              to ignore the disturbances and picked at the food.
                              Finally, trying to divert his thoughts from Murtagh,
                              he asked, <em>Who do you think has the means to
                              take control of the Varden, now that Ajihad and
                              the Twins are gone? </em></font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>She
                              hesitated. It's possible you could, if Ajihad's
                              last words were interpreted as a blessing to secure
                              the leadership. Almost no one would oppose you.
                              However, that does not seem a wise path to take.
                              I see only trouble in that direction.</em> </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>I
                              agree. Besides, Arya wouldn't approve, and she could
                              be a dangerous enemy. Elves can't lie in the ancient
                              language, but they have no such inhibition in ours-she
                              could deny that Ajihad ever uttered those words
                              if it served her purposes. No, I don't want the
                              position. . . . What about Jï¿½rmundur? </em></font></span></p>

                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>Ajihad
                              called him his right-hand man. Unfortunately, we
                              know little about him or the Varden's other leaders.
                              Such a short time has passed since we came here.
                              We will have to make our judgment on our feelings
                              and impressions, without the benefit of history.
                              </em> </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Eragon
                              pushed his fish around a lump of mashed tubers.
                              <em>Don't forget Hrothgar and the dwarf clans; they
                              won't be quiet in this. Except for Arya, the elves
                              have no say in the succession-a decision will be
                              made before word of this even reaches them. But
                              the dwarves can't be-won't be-ignored. Hrothgar
                              favors the Varden, but if enough clans oppose him,
                              he might be maneuvered into backing someone unsuited
                              for the command.</em> </font></span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><em>And
                              who might that be? </em></font></span></p>

                              person easily manipulated. </em>He closed his eyes
                              and leaned back. <em>It could be anyone in Farthen
                              Dï¿½r, anyone at all.</em></font> </span></p>
