                  <p class="monex">&nbsp;<b><a name="Chapter Excerpt">
<LINK REL="alternate" TITLE="ReadersRead RSS" HREF="http://www.readersread.com/rss.xml" TYPE="application/rss+xml">Chapter Excerpt</a></b></p>
            <p class="monex">The recruits tried to sleep.</p>
            <p class="monex">Occasionally, someone belched or expelled wind noisily, and Polly
            responded with a few fake eructations of her own. That seemed to
            inspire greater effort on the part of the other sleepers, to the
            point where the roof rattled and dust fell down, before everyone
            subsided.</p>
            <p class="monex">Once or twice she heard people stagger out into the windy
            darkness; in theory, for the privy, but probably, given male
            impatience in these matters, to aim much closer to home. Once,
            coasting in and out of a troubled dream, she thought she heard
            someone sobbing.</p>
            <p class="monex">Taking care not to rustle too much, Polly pulled out the
            much-folded, much-read, much-stained last letter from her brother,
            and read it by the light of the solitary, guttering candle. It had
            been opened and heavily mangled by the censors, and bore the stamp
            of the Duchy. It read:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <i>
              <p class="monex">Dear all,</p>
              <p class="monex">We are in .... which is .... with a ... big thing with knobs.
              On .... we with .... which is just as well because .... out of. I
              am keeping well. The food is .... .... well .... at the ..... but
              my mate .... er says not to worry, it'll be all over by .... and
              we shall all have medals.</p>
              <p class="monex">Chins up!<br>
              Paul</p>
              </i>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="monex">It was in a careful hand, the excessively clear and well-shaped
            writing of someone who had to think about every letter.</p>
            <p class="monex">She folded it up again. Paul had wanted medals, because they were
            shiny. That'd been almost a year ago, when any recruiting party that
            came past went away with the best part of a battalion, and there had
            been people waving them off with flags and music. Sometimes, now,
            smaller parties of men came back. The lucky ones were missing only
            one arm or one leg. There were no flags.</p>
            <p class="monex">She unfolded the other piece of paper. It was a pamphlet. It was
            headed &quot;From the Mothers of Borogravia!!&quot; The mothers of Borogravia
            were very definite about wanting to send their sons off to war
            Against the Zlobenian Aggressor!! and used a great many exclamation
            points to say so. And this was odd, because the mothers in the town
            had not seemed keen on the idea of their sons going off to war, and
            positively tried to drag them back. Several copies of the pamphlet
            seemed to have reached every home, even so. It was very patriotic.
            That is, it talked about killing foreigners.</p>
            <p class="monex">She'd learned to read and write after a fashion because the inn
            was big and it was a business and things had to be tallied and
            recorded. Her mother had taught her to read, which was acceptable to
            Nuggan, and her father made sure that she learned how to write,
            which was not. A woman who could write was an Abomination Unto
            Nuggan, according to Father Jupe; anything she wrote would by
            definition be a lie.</p>
            <p class="monex">But Polly had learned anyway, because Paul hadn't, at least to
            the standard needed to run an inn as busy as The Duchess. He could
            read if he could run his finger slowly along the lines, and he wrote
            letters painfully slowly, with a lot of care and heavy breathing,
            like a man assembling a piece of jewelry.</p>
            <p class="monex">He was big and kind and slow and could lift beer kegs as though
            they were toys, but he wasn't a man at home with paperwork. Their
            father had hinted to Polly, very gently but very often, that Polly
            would need to be right behind him, when the time came for him to run
            The Duchess. Left to himself, with no one to tell him what to do
            next, her brother just stood and watched birds. At Paul's
            insistence, she'd read the whole of &quot;From the Mothers of
            Borogravia!!&quot; to him, including the bits about heroes and there
            being no greater good than to die for your country.</p>
            <p class="monex">She wished, now, she hadn't done that. Paul did what he was told.
            Unfortunately, he believed what he was told, too.</p>
            <p class="monex">She put the papers away and dozed again, until her bladder woke
            her up. Oh, well, at least at this time of the morning she'd have a
            clear run.</p>
            <p class="monex">She reached out for her pack and stepped as softly as she could
            out into the rain.</p>
            <p class="monex">It was mostly just coming off the trees now, which were roaring
            in the wind that blew up the valley. The moon was hidden in the
            clouds, but there was just enough light to make out the inn's
            buildings. A certain grayness suggested that what passed for dawn in
            Pl�n was on the way.</p>
            <p class="monex">She located the men's privy, which, indeed, stank of inaccuracy.</p>
            <p class="monex">A lot of planning and practice had gone into this moment. She was
            helped by the design of her breeches, which were the old-fashioned
            kind with generous, buttoned trapdoors, and also by the experiments
            she'd made very early in the mornings when she was doing the
            cleaning. In short, with care and attention to detail, she'd found
            that a woman could pee standing up. It certainly worked back home in
            the inn's privy, which had been designed and built with the certain
            expectation of the aimlessness of the customers.</p>
            <p class="monex">The wind shook the dank building.</p>
            <p class="monex">In the dark, she thought of Aunty Hattie, who'd gone a bit
            strange around her sixtieth birthday and persistently accused
            passing young men of looking up her dress. She was even worse after
            a glass of wine, and she had one joke: &quot;What does a man stand up to
            do, a woman sit down to do, and a dog lift its leg to do?&quot; And then,
            when everyone was too embarrassed to answer, she'd triumphantly
            shriek &quot;Shake hands!&quot; and fall over. Aunty Hattie was an Abomination
            all by herself.</p>
            <p class="monex">Polly buttoned up the breeches with a sense of exhilaration. She
            felt she'd crossed a bridge, a sensation that was helped by the
            realization that she'd kept her feet dry.</p>
            <p class="monex">Someone said, &quot;Psst!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">It was just as well she'd already taken a leak. Panic instantly
            squeezed every muscle. Where were they hiding? This was just a
            rotten old shed! Oh, there were a few cubicles, but the smell alone
            suggested very strongly that the woods outside would be a much
            better proposition. Even on a wild night. Even with extra wolves.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Yes?&quot; she quavered, and then cleared her throat and demanded,
            with a little more gruffness:&quot;<i>Yes?</i>&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;You'd need these,&quot; whispered the voice. In the fetid gloom, she
            made out something rising over the top of the cubicle. She reached
            up nervously and touched softness. It was a bundle of wool. Her
            fingers explored it.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;A pair of <i>socks</i>?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Right. Wear 'em,&quot; said the mystery voice hoarsely.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Thank you, but I've brought several pairs -- &quot; Polly began.</p>
            <p class="monex">There was a faint sigh. &quot;No. Not on your feet. Shove 'em down the
            front of your trousers.&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Look,&quot; said the whisperer patiently, &quot;you don't bulge where you
            shouldn't bulge. That's good. But you don't bulge where you should
            bulge, either. You know? Lower down?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Oh! Er ... I ... but ... I didn't think people noticed ...&quot; said
            Polly, glowing with embarrassment. She had been spotted! But there
            was no hue and cry, no angry quotations from the Book of Nuggan.
            Someone was <i>helping</i>. Someone who had <i>seen</i> her ...</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;It's a funny thing,&quot; said the voice, &quot;but they notice what's
            missing more than they notice what's there. Just one pair, mark you.
            Don't get ambitious.&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">Polly hesitated.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Um ... is it obvious?&quot; she said.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;No. That's why I gave you the socks.&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;I <i>meant</i> that ... that I'm not ... that I'm ...&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Not really,&quot; said the voice in the dark. &quot;You're pretty good.
            You come over as a frightened young lad trying to look big and
            brave. You might pick your nose a bit more often. Just a tip. Few
            things interest a young man more than the contents of his nostrils.
            Now I've got a favor to ask you in return.&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">I didn't <i>ask</i> you for one, Polly thought, quite annoyed at
            being taken for being a frightened young lad when she was quite sure
            she'd come over as quite a cool, non-ruffled young lad. But she
            said, calmly: &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Got any paper?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">Wordlessly, Polly pulled &quot;From the Mothers of Borogravia!!&quot; out
            of her shirt and handed it up.</p>
            <p class="monex">She heard the sound of a match striking, and a sulfurous smell
            that only improved the general conditions.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Why, is this the escutcheon of Her Grace the Duchess I see in
            front of me?&quot; said the whisperer. &quot;Well, it won't be in front of me
            for long. Beat it ... boy.&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">Polly hurried out into the night, shocked, dazed, confused, and
            almost asphyxiated, and made it to the shed door. But she'd barely
            shut it behind her and was blinking in the blackness when it was
            thrust open again, to let in the wind, rain, and Corporal Strappi.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;All right, all right! Hands off ... well, you lot wouldn't be
            able to find 'em ... and on with socks! Hup Hup Hi Ho Hup Hup --&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">Bodies were suddenly springing up or falling over all around
            Polly. Their muscles must have been obeying the voice directly,
            because no brain could have got into gear that quickly. Corporal
            Strappi, in obedience to the law of noncommissioned officers,
            responded by making the confusion more confusing.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Good grief, a lot of old women could shift better'n you!&quot; he
            shouted with satisfaction as people flailed around looking for their
            coats and boots. &quot;Fall in! Get shaved! Every man in the regiment to
            be clean shaven, by order! Get dressed! Wazzer, I've got my eye on
            you! Move! Move! Breakfast in five minutes! Last one there doesn't
            get a sausage! Oh deary me, what a bloody <i>shower</i>!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">The four lesser apocalyptical horsemen of Panic, Bewilderment,
            Ignorance, and Shouting took control of the room, to Corporal
            Strappi's obscene glee. Polly, though, ducked out of the door,
            pulled a small tin mug out of her pack, dipped it into a water butt,
            balanced it on an old barrel behind the inn, and started to shave.</p>
            <p class="monex">She'd practiced this, too. The secret was in the old cutthroat
            razor that she'd carefully blunted. After that, it was all in the
            shaving brush and soap. Get a lot of lather on, shave a lot of
            lather off, and you'd had a shave, hadn't you? Must have done, sir,
            feel how smooth the skin is ...</p>
            <p class="monex">She was halfway through when a voice by her ear screamed: &quot;What
            d'you think you're doing, Private Parts?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">It was just as well the blade was blunt.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Perks, sir!&quot; she said, rubbing her nose. &quot;I'm shaving, sir! It's
            Perks, sir!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Sir? <i>Sir</i>? I'm not a sir, Parts, I'm a bloody corporal,
            Parts. That means you calls me 'Corporal,' Parts. And you are
            shaving in an official regimental mug, Parts, what you have not been
            issued with, right? You a deserter, Parts?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;No, s -- Corporal!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;A thief, then?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;No, Corporal!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Then how come you got a bloody mug, Parts?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;Got it off a dead man, sir -- Corporal!&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">Strappi's voice, pitched to a scream in any case, became a
            screech of rage.</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;You're a <i>looter</i>?&quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">&quot;No, Corporal! The soldier -- &quot;</p>
            <p class="monex">-- had died almost in her arms, on the floor of the inn.</p>
            <p class="monex">There had been half a dozen men in that party of returning
            heroes. They must have been trekking with gray-faced patience for
            days, making their way back to little villages in the mountains.
            Polly counted nine arms and ten legs between them, and ten eyes.</p>
            <p class="monex">But it was the apparently whole who were worse, in a way. They
            kept their stinking coats buttoned tight, in lieu of bandages over
            whatever unspeakable mess lay beneath, and they had the smell of
            death about them. The inn's regulars made space for them, and talked
            quietly, like people in a sacred place.</p>
            <p class="monex">Her father, not usually a man given to sentiment, quietly put a
            generous tot of brandy into each mug of ale, and refused all
            payment.</p>
            <p class="monex">Then it turned out that they were carrying letters from soldiers
            still fighting, and one of them had brought the letter from Paul. He
            pushed it across the table to Polly as she served them stew, and
            then, with very little fuss, he died.</p>
            <p class="monex">The rest of the men moved unsteadily on later that day, taking
            with them, to give to his parents, the pot-metal medal that had been
            in the man's coat pocket and the official commendation from the
            Duchy that went with it. Polly had taken a look at it. It was
            printed, including the Duchess's signature, and the man's name had
            been filled in, rather cramped, because it was longer than average.
            The last few letters were rammed up tight together.</p>
            <p class="monex">It's little details like that which get remembered, as undirected
            white-hot rage fills the mind. Apart from the letter and the medal,
            all the man left behind was a tin mug and, on the floor, a stain
            which wouldn't scrub out.</p>
