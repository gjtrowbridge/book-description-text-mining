        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> Chapter
          1</b></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela had
          mysterious dreams the night before she bought the riddle box.  A portent,
          maybe.  She did not think much of it.  She was used to strange dreams,
          only a few of which had ever come true.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still,
          she was alert when she left the hotel the next morning, stepping into
          the dry furnace of a rare clear Beijing day.  Winds had swept through
          the night, sloughing away the smog and scent of exhaust and decay.
          Blue sky, everywhere.  Sun glinted off the glass of skyscrapers, cars,
          diamonds �� the aluminum spines of umbrellas shading dark-eyed women
          �� casting sparks in Dela�s unprotected eyes.  The world trickled light.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The city
          had changed.  Ten years of capitalist influence, spinning a web of glass
          and advertisements; a modern infrastructure sweeping over the land as
          surely as the fine Gobi dust imported by the northern winds.  A new
          cultural revolution, here in the city, across China.  It mattered to
          Dela, the form and result.  She could hear Beijing�s growing song, the
          soul of the city �� the collective soul of its thirteen million inhabitants
          �� etched into the steel.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dangerous,
          alluring �� she did not like to listen long.  There was too much hunger
          in that voice, overwhelming promise and hope, twisted with despair.
          A double-edged blade, forged from the dreams of the people living their
          lives around her.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Just
          like any other big city,</I> she reminded herself, pouring strength
          into her mental shields.  <I>Devils and angels, the lost and found.</I>
          </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cabs swarmed
          the hotel drive �� like fire-ants, fast and red �� and Dela jumped into
          the first one that squealed to a stop.  Directions, spoken in perfect
          Mandarin, slipped off her tongue.  One week in China, and her old language
          lessons had returned with a fury.  True, she sometimes practiced with
          her assistant, Adam �� a former resident of Nanjing �� but regular life
          had settled its wings on her shoulders, years without stretching herself,
          dredging up the studies that had once taken her around the world.  Dela
          thought she might have forgotten all those parts that were not metal,
          of the forge, and was glad she had not.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cab
          wrenched from one clogged lane to another �� a hair-raising mish-mash
          of roaring engines and squealing tires �� curving down a tree-lined
          street where colorful exercise bars lined a scrap of shaded park.  Elderly
          men and women pushed and pulled their way through rotating stress exercises,
          children screaming on seesaws.  Bicycles overburdened with cargo, both
          human and vegetable, trundled down the crowded street, cars swerving
          to avoid the monstrously wide loads, as well as the packs of ragged
          young men darting across the road.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela saw
          a familiar low wall, cracked with age, its carved flowers and barbed
          wire still unchanged.  She tapped the plastic barrier and the driver
          let her out before the wide entrance, scratched blue doors flung open
          to admit both foreigners and locals, making their way through a treacherous
          maze of parked bicycles.   Dela saw faces bright with curiosity and
          greed.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Entering
          Pan Jia-Yuan.  The Dirt Market.  Tourist trap, hive of antique rip-offs
          and bald-faced lies �� a treasure hunter�s paradise.  And Dela was in
          the mood to hunt.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dust swirled
          around her feet as she slipped past crooked old men and women hawking
          nylon shopping bags to beleaguered early birds, hands already full of
          purchases.  Stepping onto the concrete platform shaded by a voluminous
          tin roof, she listened to cheap jade jingle: bracelets, statues, necklaces.
          Pretty enough, and quite popular, if the gathered crowds were any indication.
          Nothing caught her eye.  Potential gifts, perhaps, for acquaintances
          who would appreciate the gesture.  Not good enough for actual friends,
          few and far between �� deserving of special care, something beyond trinkets.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But later.
          Dela had something else to find.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She combed
          the shadowed interiors of the open-air stalls, searching until she heard
          a familiar call inside her mind. Weapons. She followed the whispers
          to their source.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scimitars
          and short swords; Tibetan daggers, hilts engraved with piled grinning
          skulls.  Mongol bows, rough with use and age, quivers flimsy with faded
          embroidery, metal trimmings.  Everywhere, dusty tinted steel �� but
          all of it disappointing.  The metalwork was poor �� cheap imitations
          for not-so-cheap prices. </font>
        <P>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela stared
          at the eager merchants, who smiled at her blond hair, pale skin, and
          electric eyes.  Easy mark.  She could see it written on their faces,
          and their judgment made her feel lonely; a foreign emotion, and unpleasant.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Bad
          enough they probably think I�m dumb,</I> she thought sourly.  Solitude
          was a gift, but only when paired with anonymity �� the disinterested
          observer.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela frowned
          at herself.  <I>You shouldn�t have returned to China if you didn�t want
          to stand out.  Buck up, girl.</I></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She left
          the weapons stalls, ignoring protests �� some of which bordered on desperate
          �� with a polite shake of her head.  Those weapons offered her nothing.
          She knew quality when she saw it, age and history when she felt it.
          A simple thing, when one worked with steel as much as she did.  When
          it sang its secrets inside her head.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still looking
          for treasures, Dela simply wandered for a time, soaking in the heat,
          the scents of incense and musty artifacts kept too long in shadow.
          She watched children sell boxed breakfasts of fried noodles and onion
          pancakes, crying out prices in high voices.  She listened to an old
          man play a lilting melody on a stone flute, and bought one of his small
          instruments.  He laughed when she tried stringing notes together, the
          hollow stone wheezing miserably.  Dela grinned, shrugging.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After nearly
          an hour of browsing, Dela found something perfect for her mother.  Generous
          rectangles of linen, dyed a vibrant navy, embroidered with delicate
          stylized flowers �� a bouquet of colors, random and perfect.  She bargained
          like a fiend, dredging up every scrap of charm and language she possessed,
          and by the end of the transaction, both she and the seller were grinning
          foolishly.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Aiii yo,�
          sighed the older woman, as she smoothed glossy silver hair away from
          an oval face that looked at least twenty years younger than her body.
          Gold-flecked eyes glittered, but not unkindly.  �It has been a long
          time since I met a foreigner who made me work for a sale.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela laughed.
          �It�s been a long time since I met anyone I enjoyed arguing with.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The woman
          quirked her lips, and for a moment, her gaze changed, becoming older,
          darker, wiser.  �I have something else you might want.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Ah, no.
          I think I have enough.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The old
          woman ignored her, already digging through the tapestries and knickknacks
          piled at her feet.  Dela watched, helpless.  She did not have the heart
          to simply walk away.  A good haggle created a bond �� certain unspoken
          etiquette.  The �last chance� possibility of a final transaction. </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The late
          summer heat was growing oppressive; air moved sluggishly between the
          stalls, thick with wares and milling bodies. The scents of dust and
          grease tickled Dela�s nose.  Sweat ran down her back.  Slightly bored
          and uncomfortable, she turned full circle, gazing at the throng of shoppers.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A man at
          the end of the aisle caught her eye.  He was of an indeterminate race,
          darkly handsome, wearing sandals and loose black slacks, as well as
          a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  Crisp, clean, and somehow
          out of place, although Dela could not determine exactly why.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At first
          she thought he was staring at her �� and perhaps he had been �� but
          now he studied the old woman digging through her wares, and Dela felt
          inexplicably uneasy for her.  His eyes were cold, measuring, haunted
          by a simmering intensity that would have been overwhelming if not matched
          to such an attractive face and body.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the
          old woman popped up with a triumphant sigh, Dela stepped close.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Behind
          me,� she whispered, not caring if the woman thought her strange, �there
          is a man watching you.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her gold-flecked
          gaze flickered; something hard rippled through her face.  �I am used
          to him.  He seems to think I have something he wants.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�I don�t
          like him,� Dela said.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The old
          woman smiled.  For a moment, her teeth looked sharp, predatory.  �Which
          is why I am going to do you a favor.  For one yuan, you may have this
          riddle box.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela stared.
          One yuan was an incredibly low price for the Dirt Market, where everything
          was inflated to exorbitant amounts, especially for foreigners.  She
          gazed at the object in the old woman�s hands.  Loosely wrapped in linen,
          she saw soft lines, rounded edges.  Wood, perhaps, although she imagined
          the hint of something harder beneath the cloth.  No metal.  Nothing
          called to her.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�What is
          the riddle?� Dela asked.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The old
          woman bared her teeth.  �Choice.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela looked
          at her sharply and reached for the box.  The woman pulled away, shaking
          her head.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Bought
          and sold,� she whispered, and Dela was struck by the intensity of her
          stare, more powerful than the gaze of the strange man still observing
          them.  �It must be bought and sold.  One yuan, please.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela could
          not bring herself to argue, to refuse.  Despite the odd air surrounding
          the transaction, the vague uneasiness pricking her spine, she fished
          a bill from her purse and handed it to the old woman.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another
          sigh, and the old woman looked deep into Dela�s eyes.  �A good choice,�
          she said, and Dela sensed some deeper, inexplicable meaning.  She carefully
          slid the wrapped box into Dela�s purse �� a swift act, as though to
          conceal.  Dela felt uneasy.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>You
          know better,</I> she chided herself.  <I>This �box� could be full of
          drugs, and you�re the stupid American courier, traipsing around until
          you get pulled over by the cops, and thrown into a sweaty prison.</I></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or not,
          she thought, staring into the old woman�s mysterious face.  Dreams and
          portents, she reminded herself, fighting down a shudder.  The stifling
          air was suddenly not warm enough.  Her bones felt cold.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The old
          woman stepped back, smiling, and suddenly she was just like any other
          Dirt Market hawker.  Eyes sharp, but somewhat glassy.  Easy mark eyes.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Bye-bye,�
          she said, and turned her back on Dela.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sudden
          reversal in attitude, from intimate to dismissive, took Dela off guard.
          She almost protested, but from the corner of her eye, felt the strange
          man�s attention suddenly weigh upon her.  An odd sensation; tangible,
          like sticky fingers on the back of her neck.  Impossible to ignore.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Go, whispered
          her instincts.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without
          another look at the old woman, Dela walked down the aisle, away from
          the strange man and his searching eyes.  She did not look back; she
          moved gracefully through the thickening crowds, slipping between stalls
          and merchants, ragged men and women rising from their haunches to shove
          vases in front of her flushed face.  Her chill vanished; the heat suddenly
          felt overwhelming, the press of bodies too much, the sensation of being
          hunted tightening her gut.  Premonition haunted her.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Dela
          finally broke free of her winding path, she found herself near the front
          gates.  Heart pounding, she jogged to the street and hailed a cab.
          A breath of cool air brushed against her sweaty neck.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�My,� drawled
          a smooth masculine voice.  �You <I>are</I> in a hurry.  What a shame.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela was
          used to unpleasant surprises, but it was still difficult not to flinch.
           The strange man stood beside her, intimately close.  Perfectly coifed,
          breathtakingly handsome.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She disliked
          him immediately.  He was too perfect, fake and unreal.  Even his voice
          sounded over-cultured, as though he was trying to affect an unfamiliar
          accent.  There was nothing kind about his smile, which skirted the edge
          of hunger, conceit.  He made Dela�s skin crawl, and she stepped out
          of his shadow, frowning.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cab stopped
          in front of her; Dela opened the door to slide in.  The stranger caught
          her hand.  His touch burned, and she barely kept from gasping at the
          strange sensation.  His skin felt thin as parchment, ancient, but with
          such heat �� actual fire, to her ice.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shock turned
          to anger.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Get your
          hand off me,� she said, low and hard.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He smiled.
          �It has been a long time since I had a conversation with a beautiful
          woman.  Perhaps I could share your cab?  I know a lovely courtyard restaurant.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conversation?
          Beautiful woman?  Dela would have laughed, except he clearly expected
          her to say yes; he even nudged her toward the cab, maintaining his iron
          grip on her hand, his smile as white and plastic as a cheap doll.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�I don�t
          think so,� Dela snapped, surprised and pleased to see his dark eyes
          shutter, his smile falter.  Did he really think she would be so easily
          cowed, so stupid and desperate?  �And if you don�t let go of me this
          instant, I am going to start screaming.�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps
          it was the cold promise in Dela�s voice; all charm fled the stranger�s
          face.  The transformation was stunning.  He leaned close, his breath
          hot, smelling faintly of garlic, pepper.  His gaze, dark and oppressive,
          lifted the hairs on the back of Dela�s neck.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Something
          fluttered against her mind, then, bitter and sharp.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela clenched
          her jaw so tight her teeth ached, and the stranger smiled.  A real smile,
          bright and blistering and sharp.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�How interesting,�
          he said, squeezing her hand until her bones creaked. The pain sparked
          rage, striking Dela�s fear to dust.  No one hurt her. Ever.  Not while
          there was still breath in her body.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Loosening
          her jaw, Dela smiled �� and screamed.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was
          a marvelous scream, and Dela took an unholy amount of glee in the look
          of pain that crossed over the stranger�s face. Bikes crashed into cars;
          passersby stopped dead in their tracks to stare.  Dela pulled against
          his hand.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Help me!�
          she screeched in both Chinese and English.  �Please!  This man is trying
          to rob me!  He�s going to rape me!  Please, please�<I>someone!</I>�</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela did
          not think she had ever sounded so frightened or pathetic in her entire
          life, but the horrible part was that while she had started out acting,
          the growing fury in the man�s face suddenly did scare her.  He looked
          like he wanted to kill her with his bare hands �� as though he would,
          right there with everyone watching.  Her entire arm screamed with pain
          as his fingers crushed bone.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soldiers,
          common enough on Beijing�s streets, ran from the gathered crowd of onlookers.
          Strong young men, they latched onto Dela�s assailant, wrenching him
          away from her.  It was quite a struggle; he was very strong and refused
          to let go of her hand.  When he did, a cry escaped his throat; a bark
          of frustration, anger.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela slipped
          backwards into the cab, fumbling for the door, eyes wide upon the hate
          distorting that handsome face.  The urge to run overwhelmed and she
          rapped her knuckles on the plastic barrier.  The startled cab driver
          did not wait for her destination.  He swerved into traffic, car brakes
          squealing all around them, horns blaring.  Within seconds, the Dirt
          Market �� and the ongoing struggle outside its gate �� was left behind.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela rubbed
          her arms, shuddering.  Her face felt hot to the touch, but the rest
          of her burned cold.  She bowed her head between her knees, taking deep
          measured breaths.  The breathing helped her sudden nausea, but her heart
          continued to thud painfully against her ribs.  She managed to tell the
          driver the name of the hotel, and then held her aching hand, trying
          to forget the feel of the man�s fingers squeezing flesh and bone.  The
          hot ash of his skin.  The cool tremble against her mind.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A great
          stillness stole over Dela as she rode the memory of that sensation.
          She could count on one hand the number of times a stranger had purposely
          pressed his mind to her own, and while her shields were strong �� her
          brother had made sure of that �� Dela was in no mood to test herself
          against anyone who really wished her harm.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>But
          he didn�t know I was different until the end. </I> Which meant the stranger
          had followed her out of the Dirt Market for another reason, one that
          had nothing to do with her psi-abilities.  Dela remembered his cold
          dark eyes, how he had watched the old woman long before paying attention
          to her.  What was his need, his purpose?</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through
          her purse, Dela felt a hard lump.  The riddle box.  Clarity spilled
          over her, and she almost examined her tiny purchase then and there.
          She caught the driver watching her through his rear view mirror, and
          hesitated.  If she really had just purchased something awful like drugs
          or God-knows-what, she did not want any witnesses when she began poking
          her nose into Trouble.  If that was what the riddle box represented.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>He can�t
          find me,</I> Dela reminded herself.  <I>That creep has no idea who I
          am, and this is a big city.</I>  It was a small comfort.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Dela
          arrived at the hotel, she stumbled up to her room, ignoring the strange
          looks people cast in her direction.  She caught a glimpse of herself
          in the elevator�s polished steel doors, and winced.  Her blouse had
          popped open, her face was beet red, and her hair looked�well, just plain
          bad.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�Round
          one goes to the Evil Minion of Satan,� she muttered, holding shut the
          front of her blouse.  A nearby businessman gave her a strange look,
          and Dela laughed weakly �� which didn�t seem to comfort him at all.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once inside
          her room, Dela turned all the locks on the door, and threw her purse
          on the bed.  The linen-wrapped box spilled out onto the burgundy covers,
          and she stared at it for one long minute.  Stared, and then retreated
          into the bathroom for a shower.  Dela couldn�t take any more bad news
          �� not just then.  She desperately wanted to scrub away the morning,
          the lingering miasma of the stranger�s presence.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela remained
          under the hot water for an indecent amount of time, until at last she
          stopped shivering.  Infinitely calmer, she wrapped thick towels around
          her body and hair, and returned to the main room.  She flopped on the
          bed with a sigh and picked up the wrapped box.  Such a small, innocuous
          object.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Sometimes
          a cigar is just a cigar.  The box may have nothing to do with that guy
          crawling all over you.  He could have just pegged you as a victim.</I></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">True, but
          what had the old woman said?</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>He seems
          to think I have something he wants.</I></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frowning,
          Dela carefully unwrapped the layers of fine linen �� surprising, to
          find such quality on an object from the Dirt Market �� and caught her
          breath as the riddle box was finally revealed.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was
          exquisite, with the breathless quality of some exotic myth.  Round,
          no larger than the palm of herhand.  Rosewood, polished to a deep red
          that was almost black, inlaid with silver and gold, onyx and lapis.
          The lid was etched with some foreign, incomprehensible script that looked
          more like musical notations than words, and the curved sides displayed
          an elaborate series of images, a story:  a magnificent tiger inside
          a thick forest; the beast suddenly a man, fighting, raging �� and then
          the tiger once again, prone, locked inside a cage.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The detail
          was incredible, impossibly precise and subtle.  Dela had never seen
          such clarity of pinpoint and line �� not even in her own art, and her
          methods were unorthodox, to say the least.  Dela ran her fingers over
          the carvings, the bright inlays.  She felt the tiger�s gold-lined fur
          beneath her fingers, sensing his capture.  The sensation of imprisonment
          made Dela inexplicably unhappy.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She pressed
          the riddle box against her cheek and closed her eyes.  She could finally
          taste the trace of metal inside her head, but it was faint, faint, an
          ancient whisper like the brush of a brittle leaf.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Its age
          startled her, sent a rush of pressure into her gut.  Dela rolled the
          metal inside her mind, listening to its sleepy secrets.  Millennia old.
          Two millennia, maybe more.  She felt breathless with awe.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>What
          was that old woman thinking when she sold this to me?  It�s priceless.</I></font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Dela
          thought of the strange man, the old woman�s cryptic remarks �� and his
          behavior suddenly made sense.  She cradled the small treasure in her
          palms, turning it over in her fingers as surely as her thoughts were
          turning, twisting.  Yes, someone might very well kill for this �� or
          kidnap, assault.  But why had the man waited until he thought Dela possessed
          the box?  Why not go after the old woman if he suspected she had it?
          Surely she would be an easier target. </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela sighed.
          She could understand the old woman wanting to rid herself of the box
          if she thought it would cost her life, but the black market would have
          offered her more money than one yuan!  It didn�t make sense.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela tried
          opening the lid, but it was stuck fast.  She studied the box, and smiled.
          A true riddle.  It took her fifteen minutes of careful fiddling, using
          her instincts more than her eyes, but she finally found the two releases,
          set in an onyx claw and a silver leaf.  Pressing them simultaneously
          with one hand, she unscrewed the box lid �� </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�� and
          the earth moved.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Violent
          vertigo sent Dela reeling into the pillows, clutching her head.  Scents
          overwhelmed: rich loam, sap, wood smoke.  Some essence of a verdant
          forest, come alive inside her room.  Darkness, everywhere, but her eyes
          were clenched shut; Dela was afraid to open them, scared she would no
          longer be in the hotel.  Dorothy, transported to Oz.  Her displacement
          felt that complete.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dela slowly
          became aware of the bedspread beneath her bare legs.  The pillows, soft
          against her face.  <I>Silly imagination,</I> she chided herself, and
          turned to look at the box.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was
          no longer on the bed beside her. </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Something
          in her stomach lurched, another premonition.  She felt a ghost of movement,
          behind her, and she twisted �� </font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">�� only
          to watch, dumbfounded, as sheer golden light spiraled through her room,
          shimmering in steep waves, a sunset palette of colors stroking air.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The light
          slowly took form, a gathering pressure of intense pinpricks.  Dela blinked,
          and in that moment, the light coalesced.  She felt thunder without sound,
          an impact to the air that lifted everything in the room, including herself.</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The light
          disappeared, and in its place:</font>
        <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A man.</font>
