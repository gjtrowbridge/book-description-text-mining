<p>DAISY HEARS THEM FIRST: the crunch of feet on the
gravel, the resonant clearing of throats outside our living
room window.</p>

<p>She darts to the window, tugs at the curtain.</p>

<p>"They're here," she says.</p>

<p>She kneels on the sofa, presses her face to the glass. Her
warm breath mists the pane.</p>

<p>I turn off the light, so the room is lit by the dancing red
of the fire, and go to stand beside her, pulling the curtain
open. My head is close to hers: I smell the musky sweetness
of her hair. Sinead hangs back, fiddling with her new velvet
choker, an early Christmas present from her mother.
She's reached that age when enthusiasms have to be carefully
concealed; and anyway, gangsta rap is really more her
thing.</p>

<p>I glance at Richard. He folds his <em>Times</em> and turns
toward the window. In the shadowed room and the flickering
of the firelight, I can't see if he's smiling.</p>

<p>"Look," says Daisy. "They've got snowflakes on their
eyelashes."</p>

<p>There are ten of them in the darkness by the steps to
our front door. They're bundled in coats and scarves, the
everyday color leached from their clothes and faces by the
torchlight. Their breath is thick; there are siftings of snow
on their shoulders. They move around and shuffle into position.
Nicky is there, in a woolen hat that hides her crisp
black hair, with little reindeer dangling from her ears. She
looks up at Daisy, grins, and blows her a kiss. The earrings
shiver.</p>

<p>The others have their eyes down; they're fumbling
through their music books with clumsy wet-gloved fingers.
There are women I recognize from Daisy's class at school,
Kate's mother, Natalie's mother &#151; women I know only by
the names of their children &#151; and men from the choir at the
church round the corner, and two or three teenagers. The
torches they carry suffuse their faces with red: A myriad of
little torches glimmer in their eyes. Next to Nicky there's
a man I don't recognize. He has unruly fair hair, a darkly
gleaming leather jacket; I can just make out his heavy eyebrows
and the line of his jaw. Above them, a nail-paring
moon shines briefly through the clouds. Nicky knows what
this moon is supposed to mean: She's been through feng
shui and aromatherapy, and her current passion is witchcraft
&#151; the kind of bland designer witchcraft you can read
about in lavish books with pastel velour covers &#151; and she
says that the moons have names, and this is the birch
moon &#151; the first moon of the year, the moon of beginnings.</p>

<p>The snow began this morning, with a perfect, theatrical
sense of timing. In our garden, there's a milky skin of ice on
the pond, and the dangling tendrils of forsythia are white
knotted strands of wool, and the stone frog fountain has a
hat of snow. We played snowballs, Sinead and Daisy and
me, staying out far too long, not realizing how chilled we
were, and when we finally came back into the warmth of
the kitchen, Daisy's fingers were red and shiny in spite of
her gloves, and she cried as the blood came back into them.
I told her they hurt because they were getting better, warming
up, but it didn't help to know that; she couldn't stop
crying. In the cold, the foxes are getting bolder, coming
close to the house. This afternoon I saw them on the patio,
looking in at the French doors, then shying away, mangy,
thin, golden, one with a paw that it couldn't touch to the
ground, quite silent yet leaving perfect footprints. Since
then more snow has fallen, blotting out the foxes' footprints
and our own, so our back garden looks as though no
one has ever been there. If you went out there now, you
would feel a thing you rarely feel in London: a sense of
how high the sky is, of the immensity of the night.</p>

<p>The singers clear their throats and start to sing. Their
faces are lifted, eager, their breath like smoke. I saw three
ships come sailing in, on Christmas Day, on Christmas
Day. Singing voices sound different outside, fragile, thinner,
half their resonance swallowed up by the air; yet so
precise and perfect. I see the ships in my mind's eye: They're
like the ships in a toddler's picture book, with rainbowpainted
prows and many silken sails, playful, gaudy, cresting
the curled waves.</p>

<p>Daisy gives a little sigh and rests her head against me.
Sinead comes close, sits on the arm of the sofa. They're
both thoroughly irreverent &#151; they have their own salacious
parodies of carols, picked up in the playground &#151;
yet they're held, stilled, by the song. The room smells of
cinnamon and warm wine, of the forest freshness of juniper,
of the apple cake that is cooling in the kitchen, moist
and sweet and crusted on top with sugar. I want to hold
this moment, to make it last forever, the scents and the
singing and firelight and Daisy's head against me.</p>

<p>There's a long, still moment after the end of the song,
like a held breath. Then Daisy applauds extravagantly, and
I turn on the lights and hurry to the door and open it wide.</p>

<p>There are seven stone steps up to our door. Nicky
comes first, bounding up two at a time. She's pink skinned,
eager eyed.</p>

<p>"Catriona &#151; you look so <em>good</em>."</p>

<p>I kiss her; her face is cold.</p>

<p>"Were we brilliant?" she asks.</p>

<p>"You were wonderful."</p>

<p>She pulls off her hat, shakes out her spiky hair. Wetness
sprays from her, the reindeer earrings dance. She holds out
the Christian Aid tin, rattles it hopefully. Daisy puts in our
money, with a satisfactory clatter.</p>

<p>The others follow her, noisily talking: They are themselves
again, separate, banal, the braid of music that bound
them together unwoven. They shrug off their wet, heavy
clothes; the powdering of snow on their hair is melting al-
ready. They stretch out their arms and relish the warmth.
The house is suddenly full of sound, of energy.</p>

<p>I bring the saucepan from the kitchen and dole the wine
into tumblers. Daisy and Sinead hand the glasses round,
carrying them like precious things, holding them right at
the top so as not to burn their fingers. I see their heads
as they weave their way through the crush: Sinead with
hair that's dark and thick like her mother's, pulled back in a
ponytail and fastened with karma beads; and Daisy, blond
like me.</p>

<p>Nicky, passing, whispers in my ear, "D'you like my new
recruit?" She gestures rather obviously toward the man in
the leather jacket.</p>

<p>I nod.</p>

<p>"Fergal O'Connor. He's a sweetie &#151; bringing up his little
boy on his own. Jamie goes to Saint Mark's, I think. Remind
me to introduce you."</p>

<p>She moves off to talk to Richard.</p>

<p>I chat for a while to Kate's mother and Natalie's mother.
They drink eagerly, cradling the tumblers between their
hands to warm them.</p>

<p>Natalie's mother looks greedily round the room.</p>

<p>"Nice house," she says.</p>

<p>Her teeth are already stained purple by the wine.</p>

<p>I shrug a little. "Well, we're so lucky to live here."</p>

<p>"I'll say." Her fervor isn't quite polite.</p>

<p>They talk about their children: about homework, what
a pain, quite honestly you end up having to do it yourself;
and the 11+ and how ghastly it is, last year some girls were
so nervous they puked up before they went in; and whether
eight is really too young for your child to have her first cell
phone.</p>

<p>These themes are familiar; I only half join in. I look
round the room, feeling a warm sense of satisfaction, seeing
it through Natalie's mother's eyes, recognizing what I
have achieved here. Because any woman might look at it
now in that greedy, appraising way. Yet when Richard and
I first came here and walked between the stone dogs and up
the seven steps, and the woman from Tarrant's unlocked
the door and ushered us in, I felt such uncertainty. It was
empty; it smelled musty, unused, and there were green
streaks of damp and horrible flowered wallpaper. But it
still had a kind of grandeur, with its parquet floors and
cornices and mantlepieces of marble, suggesting to me a
whole way of life that I'd probably gleaned from TV costume
drama: men taking a rest from empire building who
warmed their backs at the fire, port, political conversations.
I couldn't begin to imagine that I could feel at home
in these imposing spaces. I walked round the edge of this
room, my footsteps echoing in the emptiness, and felt
flimsy, insubstantial, as though I might float to the ceiling,
as though nothing weighed me down. Richard put his
arm round me &#151; he did that often then &#151; and I felt his
warmth, his weight, his opulent smell of cigars and aftershave,
grounding me, making me real. And the estate
agent, a pleasant woman, canny about such things, read
my hesitation. "Let me show you something," she said. She
took us through the French doors and into the garden. It
was big for a town garden, and secluded, with a rose bed,
badly neglected, just a few tattered rags of roses still clinging
to the gangly bloodred stems, and a pond, empty of water,
with weeds growing up from the concrete. The starlings
in the birch tree were puffed up with the cold, like fruit
ready to fall. There were worm casts in the grass and pools
of water lying on the lawn and it all terribly needed tending.
But the lovely shapes of it were there &#151; the rose bed
and the pond and the way the trees leaned in around the
lawn, encircling it with a kind of intimacy. And I saw how
it could be: saw the stone frog spewing water from his wide
cheerful mouth, saw the lily pads and the old-fashioned
roses, palest pink and amber, single flowers not lasting long
but scented, clambering up the wall.</p>

<p>From that moment it was easy. We bought it and
moved in, and I knew just what to do with it, decorating
most of it myself. I seemed to expand to fill the space; it
started to feel right for me. And now it is all as it should be,
elegant, established, with velvet curtains and tiebacks with
tassels and heavy pelmets edged with plum-colored braid.
Our things look right here, in this setting; everything seems
to fit: Richard's Chinese vases and his violin, and the two
ceramic masks, one white, one black, that we brought back
from our honeymoon, and a little painting I did of a poppy
that I thought was maybe good enough to frame and go up
on the wall; and on the mantelpiece, there's a cardboard
Nativity scene, intricate, in rich dark colors, that I bought
from Benjamin Pollock's Toyshop in Covent Garden. The
Nativity scene was my choice, not the girls'; they'd probably
have gone for something more contemporary and plastic.
But I love traditional things. I'm always hunting them
out, in junk shops and on market stalls: things made to old
designs or with a patina of use, a bit of history. Like when
I decorated Daisy's room, the floors stripped and varnished
to a pale honey color, the ceiling night-sky blue with a stenciling
of stars, and I knew there was something missing. It
needed something old, loved, a teddy bear to sit in the cane
chair, an old bear with bits of fur worn off, like people
sometimes keep in trunks in their attics. And I wondered
what it would be like to have had a childhood that left such
traces &#151; old toys, photos, perhaps &#151; things that are worn
with use, with loving, to store away, then come upon years
later and show to your own children, with a little stir of
sentiment or mildly embarrassed amusement or nostalgia.
In the end I found a bear in a department store: It had oldfashioned
curly fur and was dressed in Edwardian clothes,
but it smelled of the factory. I bought it anyway. It was the
best I could do.</p>

<p>The women are reminiscing about recent toy obsessions
&#151; Furbies, and Pok&#233;mon, and Tamagotchis, the
pocket computer animals that you have to feed and care
for. Natalie's mother saw a woman at a school concert who
had three Tamagotchis hanging round her neck, so she
could look after them: Now, that is going too far; I mean,
she was really under the thumb. I'm only half-listening.
Over their shoulders I can see Richard talking to somebody's
teenage daughter. He looks too smart for the company
in his jacket and tie &#151; he isn't very good at casual
dressing. The girl is perhaps eighteen, just a little younger
than I was when he chose me. She's wearing a sleeveless top
in spite of the snow, showing off her prettily sloping shoulders.
Her arms are thin and white and her hair is watered
silk and she has a big gleamy smile. I can tell he's charming
her; he comes from that privileged class of men who
are always charming &#151; perhaps most charming &#151; with
strangers. And Richard likes young women; it's what he
was drawn to in me, that new gloss. I know I'm not like I
was when first we met. I don't have that sheen anymore.</p>

<p>Nicky is next to Richard, talking to the man with the
unruly hair. She's getting in close &#151; not surprising, really;
he's quite attractive. Now that she's taken off her coat, she
looks like a picture from a magazine. There's something altogether
contemporary about Nicky. She has leather skirts
and boots with molded rubber soles and she works at an
advertising agency, where, in spite of &#151; or maybe because
of &#151; the niceness and easygoingness of Neil, her husband,
who is an inventive cook and a devoted parent, she exchanges
erotic e-mails with the creative director. "You see,
we're not like you and Richard," she says to me sometimes,
leaning across the table at the Caf&#233; Rouge toward me.
"You two are so transparently everything to each other. I
mean, it's wonderful if you can be like that &#151; if you've got
that kind of marriage &#151; what could be lovelier? But Neil
and I aren't like that, especially since the kids; maybe we
couldn't ever be. I don't think I'm built to be completely
faithful; it's just not in my genes. . . ."</p>

<p>She feels my eyes on her. She turns, speaks to the man
again. They come toward me. Kate's mother and Natalie's
mother move away.</p>

<p>He smiles at me: His eyes are gray and steady. Nicky
puts her hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"Meet Fergal," she says. "Our latest recruit. A tenor.
Tenors are like gold dust. I love my tenors to bits."</p>

<p>I smile. He says hello. I remember how much I like Irish
voices.</p>

<p>Nicky takes her last bite of apple cake and licks her sugary
fingers. "Catriona, your cooking is out of this world. I
have to have more of this."</p>

<p>Sinead walks past with a plate. Nicky lunges after her.</p>

<p>My boots have high heels and my eyes are just on a
level with his. We look at each other and there's a brief, embarrassed
pause.</p>

<p>"I liked the carols," I tell him. Then think how vacuous
this sounds.</p>

<p>"Well," he says, and shrugs a little. "It's been fun."
I note the past tense. I rapidly decide that he's not the
sort of man who'd like me. I know how I must seem to
him, a privileged, sheltered woman.</p>

<p>"Nicky's good at arranging things," I say. "Making
things happen."</p>

<p>He nods vaguely. He's looking over my shoulder. I've
bored him already.</p>

<p>But then I see he is looking at my picture &#151; the painting
of poppies that I hung on the wall. It's just behind me.</p>

<p>"Who did the painting?" he asks.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"I wondered if it was you," he says. "I like it."</p>

<p>I feel a little awkward, but acknowledge to myself that
I am quite pleased with this painting: The petals are that
dark purple that is almost black, yet there's a gleam on
them.</p>

<p>"I don't do much," I say. "It just makes a nice break. I
can hide away in my attic and the girls know not to disturb
me. I suppose it's a bit conceited to put it up on the wall."</p>

<p>"D'you always do that?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Run yourself down like that?"</p>

<p>"Probably. I guess it's irritating."</p>

<p>We both smile.</p>

<p>"When you paint, is it always flowers?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Always. I can't do people. I'm really limited."</p>

<p>He looks at me quizzically. His eyes are full of laughter.</p>

<p>"OK, I know I'm doing it again," I say. "But it's true.
And I can't draw out of my head, either. It has to be something
I can put on the table in front of me. I can only paint
what I see."</p>

<p>"D'you sell them?"</p>

<p>I nod, flattered he should ask. "There's a gift shop in
Kingston that takes them sometimes."</p>

<p>He looks at it again. "It's not very cheerful. For a
flower. It's kind of ominous. All that shadow around it."</p>

<p>"Really. How can you read all that into a picture?" But
I'm pleased. There's something rather trivial about doing
paintings of flowers and selling them in a gift shop alongside
scented candles and boxed sets of soap. I like that he
can see a kind of darkness in it.</p>

<p>I realize I am happy: my body fluid and easy with the
wine, my room hospitable, beautiful, this man with the
Irish lilt in his voice approving of my picture; this is easy,
this is how things should be.</p>

<p>He's looking at me with those steady gray eyes. There's
something in his look that I can't work out: sex, or something
else, more obscure, more troubling.</p>

<p>"I know you," he says suddenly. "Don't I?"</p>

<p>I laugh politely. "I don't think so."</p>

<p>Someone is leaving. The door opens; the cold and the
night come in.</p>

<p>"I do," he says. "I'm sure I know you; I recognize your
face."</p>

<p>He's staring at me, trying to work it out. It sounds like
a come-on, but his look is puzzled, serious. The fear that is
never far from me lays its cold hand on my skin.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know where you could have seen me."
My voice is casual, light. "Perhaps the school gate at Saint
Mark's? Daisy goes there." But I know this isn't right, I
know I'd have noticed him. "Nicky says that's where your
little boy goes," I add, trying to drag the conversation away
to somewhere safe.</p>

<p>He shakes his head. "Jamie doesn't start till after Christmas."</p>

<p>"You'll like it," I tell him. "Daisy's eight, she's in year
three, she has the nicest teacher. . . ."</p>

<p>But he won't let it rest. "Where d'you work?" he asks.</p>

<p>"I don't." Then, biting back the urge to apologize for
my life, that must sound so passive &#151; "I mean, not outside
the home. I used to work in a nursery school. But that's
ages ago now."</p>

<p>"It wasn't there. Forget it. It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>But I'm upset and he knows it. He tries to carry on. He
tells me a bit about his work: He's a journalist, he says.
And he asks what I'm painting now and where my ideas
come from. But the mood is spoiled, it can't be restored or
recovered. As soon as he decently can, he leaves me. All
evening I feel troubled: even when the singers have gone,
calling out their thanks and Christmas wishes, setting off
into the snow, which is falling more thickly now, casting its
nets over everything under the chill, thin light of the moon
of beginnings. We stand there in the suddenly quiet room. It looks banal
now: There are cake crumbs on the carpet, and every glass
has a purplish, spicy sediment.</p>

<p>"I'll do the washing up," says Richard.</p>

<p>Normally I'd say, No, let me, you sit down, but tonight
I give in gratefully. Sinead goes to help him.</p>

<p>I turn off the light again, and the firelight plays on every
shiny surface: My living room seems like a room from another
time. I stretch out on the sofa. Daisy comes and folds
herself into me. Her limbs are loose, heavy, her skin is hot
and dry; I feel her tiredness seeping into me.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy it?" I ask her.</p>

<p>To my surprise, she shakes her head. In the red erratic
firelight, her face looks sharper, thinner. Little bright flames
glitter in her eyes. Suddenly, without warning, she starts
crying.</p>

<p>I hug her. "It's ever so late," I tell her. "You'll be fine in
the morning." She rubs her damp face against me.</p>

<p>I don't want her to go to sleep unhappy. I can never
bear it when she's sad &#151; which is silly, really, I know that,
because children often cry. I always rush in to smooth
things over, want to keep everything perfect. So I try to distract
her with shadow shapes, the animal patterns I learned
how to make from a booklet I bought at the toy shop in
Covent Garden. I move my hands in the beam of light from
the open door to the hall, casting shadows across the wall
by the fireplace. I make the seagull, flapping my hands together;
and the crab, my fingers hunched so it sidles along
the mantelpiece; and the alligator, snapping at the board
games on the bookshelf. Daisy wipes her face and starts to
smile.</p>

<p>I make the shape of the weasel; we wait and wait, Daisy
holding her breath: This is her favorite. And just when
you've stopped expecting it, it comes, the weasel's pounce,
down into some poor defenseless thing behind the skirting
board.</p>

<p>She lets out a brief thrilled scream, and even I start a little.
Yet these animals, these teeth, this predatoriness: these
are only the shadows of my hands.</p>
