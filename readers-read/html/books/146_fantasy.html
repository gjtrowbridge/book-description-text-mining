<h4 align="center">The master first lets slip<br />
his best hounds</h4>

<p>Something was up. The Royal Guard liked to think it knew all the
news and heard it before anyone else did, but that day it had been shut
out. The morning watch had been on duty for two hours already, but
Commander Vicious had not arrived to hold the daily inspection and
the graveyard shift had not yet been stood down. They were supposedly
attending the King, who was meeting with senior advisors in the council
chamber. Absurd! Even during the worst panics of the Thencaster
Conspiracy, three years ago, Athelgar had never summoned his cabinet
in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Deputy Commander Lyon must have some idea what was going on,
but he refused to admit it. Infuriatingly, he just sat behind his desk in the
guardroom, reading a book of poetry -- Lyon not only read poetry, he
wrote it too, yet he was a fine swordsman, subtle and unpredictable.The
half-dozen Blades sustaining the permanent dice game under the window
were doing so halfheartedly, grumbling more than gambling. Sir Wolf was polishing his boots in a corner -- Wolf never read poetry, was
never invited into the games, and cared not a fig what folly the King was
pursuing this time.</p>

<p>The park beyond the frost-spangled panes was all pen-and-ink, stark
white-and-black, sun-bright snow and cadaver trees under a sky of anemic
blue, for this was Secondmoon of 395, the coldest winter in memory.
Nocare, with its high ceilings and huge windows, was a summer
palace, impossible to heat in cold weather. The King had moved the
court there on some inexplicable whim and could not return it to poky
old Greymere as long as the roads were blocked by snowdrifts. Courtiers
slunk around unhappily, huddled in furs and muttering under their
smoky breath.</p>

<p>Innumerable feet shuffled past the guardroom door: gentry, heralds,
pages, porters, stewards,White Sisters, Household Yeomen. No one paid
any heed until a rapid tattoo of heel taps raised every head. Blades knew
the sound of Guard boots, and these were in a hurry.</p>

<p>Wolf went on polishing his left one.</p>

<p>In marched Sir Damon, still wearing his sash as officer in charge of
the night watch. The kibitzers by the window exchanged shocked
glances.The matter was much more than routine if Sir Vicious had sent
a senior Blade as messenger, instead of a junior or just a page.</p>

<p>Damon glanced around the room, then bent to whisper something
to Lyon. Lyon turned to Wolf.</p>

<p>"Leader wants you."</p>

<p>Wolf put foot in boot and stamped. "Where?"</p>

<p>Damon said, "Council Chamber. He's still with the Pirate's Son."</p>

<p>At the dice table, eyebrows rose even higher. The Pirate's Son was
King Athelgar. It was common knowledge that Vicious preferred to
keep Sir Wolf out of the King's sight, so if Wolf was wanted now, it was
because the King had called for him by name.</p>

<p>Wolf was the King's Killer.</p>

<p>Ignoring the rabble's surprise, Wolf strode across to the mirror and
looked himself over with care. Like all Blades he was of middle height,
slim and athletic, but he was invariably the best-turned-out man in the
Guard -- boots and sword belt gleaming like glass, not a wrinkle in his
hose nor speck of dust marring his jerkin. He adjusted the feather in his
bonnet an imperceptible amount and turned away. He did not examine
his face. No one looked at that horror unless they must.</p>

<p>Exchanging nods with a lip-chewing Lyon, he strode out into the
corridor, and Damon fell into step beside him. Together they marched
along marble corridors, past statuary and tapestries. Courtiers stared
with interest at two senior members of the Royal Guard moving at an
urgent clip. Word that the King had sent for the infamous Sir Wolf
would spread like fire in dry grass.</p>

<p>So what was up? The last time Wolf had been summoned to the
royal presence, Athelgar had named him -- over Leader's objections -- to
lead the Elboro mission, which had required him to kill two brother
Blades. It had not been the first such filthy job the Pirate's Son had given
him, either, and Wolf 's written report afterwards had let Athelgar
Radgaring know exactly what he thought of his liege lord. Moreover,
since Leader had not ordered him to rewrite it, it had warned His
Majesty that others shared those opinions.The Guard had been shorthanded
back then, else Wolf might have been thrown in a dungeon for
some of the comments in that report. In the two years since,Vicious had
kept him well away from the King.</p>

<p>What had changed? Well, the Guard was up to strength now, so one
possibility was that Athelgar was going to award him the Order of the
Royal Boot. That was highly unlikely. Knowing how Wolf felt about
him, Athelgar was more likely to keep the King's Killer bound to absolute
loyalty forever -- safer that way.</p>

<p>Another possibility was that the Pirate's Son wanted someone murdered.
Blades were bound by oath and conjuration to defend their ward
from his enemies, not to commit crimes on royal whims, but defense
could cover a multitude of nasty situations.</p>

<p>Wolf saw anger in Damon's tightly clenched jaw. Damon was a decent
man, not one of those who carried grudges against the King's
Killer.</p>

<p>"Any hints, brother?"</p>

<p>"Dunno anything. Huntley and Flint rode in about four hours ago."</p>

<p>"Ah! And Leader wakened the Pirate's Son?"</p>

<p>"They've been in council ever since. No one's allowed in or out except
inquisitors. A plague of inquisitors!"</p>

<p>That news merely deepened the mystery. Sir Flint and Sir Huntley
were typical examples of Blades who failed to find a real life after being
knighted and discharged from the Guard. Both men were in their fifties,
idling away years at Ironhall, instructing boys in fencing and horsemanship,
yet still hankering after the sins of the city ...
