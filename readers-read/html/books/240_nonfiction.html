Ada pushed open the tent flaps and searched for
Knight. He had gone out some time ago to chop wood, and should have been back by
now. Crawford, Maurer, and Galle had left them just one week before and Ada was
still anxious about being left alone.
<P>Suddenly she saw him, several feet away, lying
on the ground, limp and still. Ada felt her heart rise into her throat as she
took a step forward. Knight couldn't be dead. If he were dead she would be all
alone, and then who would care for her? She took another step and another until
she was standing over him, looking into his pale, gaunt face. </P>
<P>Thank God, he was breathing. She knelt over him
and tried to wake him. It took a good five minutes -- or so it seemed to Ada --
but finally he stirred, the life coming back into him. He woke to see her
anxious face, pinched and strained, peering down at him. </P>
<P>&quot;I'm all right now, Ada.&quot; His speech was
halting, his voice soft, but he wanted to reassure her because he could tell she
was terrified. &quot;I just felt a little faint.&quot; </P>
<P>Confused and frightened, Ada pulled him to his
feet. He leaned heavily on her as she helped him into the tent and once there,
utterly spent, he crumpled into a pile on his bed. He began to talk to her then,
telling her for the first time how ill he was. It was scurvy, as far as he could
tell, and it seemed to be getting worse. He had tried to keep it from the
others, but Crawford knew, and Maurer a little, but now he could not hide it.
His mood was gloomy, as he lay on his bunk, and he told Ada that for the first
time he was scared. &quot;I guess we shan't see Nome again,&quot; he said darkly. </P>
<P>She told him to stay in bed and rest, and
promised that she would finish chopping the wood. She was used to it, she said,
and had done that kind of work at home. The last thing Knight wanted to do was
lie helpless in the tent while Ada took care of him. But when he found himself
too weak to lift his head, he consented. </P>
<P>Ada went outside and took up the axe and began
cutting the wood. Afterward, she collected snow for their drinking water, and
then she took the map Maurer had left them of his trapline and followed it to
his traps to check for foxes. As usual, there was nothing, and she turned back
to camp, discouraged. </P>
<P>She had no idea Knight was this ill. No one had
told her. Why had they not told her? She couldn't understand, but one thing was
clear. Now <i>she</i> must take care of them until he was strong enough to get
out of bed. She prayed he would recover enough in a few days to look after her
again. </P>
<P align=left>***<br>
Knight felt the earth spin every time he made a sudden movement, and he lost his
breath easily. He became so winded just lifting a piece of firewood that he had
to sit down afterward and catch his breath. He didn't remember the severe
shortness of breath or the swelling in his legs from the first round of scurvy
he'd suffered in 1917.</P>
<P align=left>He dreamed of fresh meat. If only a
bear would wander into camp. If only he felt strong enough to make it to
Maurer's traps to check for foxes. No doubt there would be at least a fox or two
found there, but he had been afraid to check until he felt better because what
if something should happen to him? The traps weren't terribly far from camp,
but if he should lose consciousness or have an accident, there would be no one
there to help him. The thought of being helpless did frighten him, and he would
not take that risk, no matter how much he needed the fresh meat. </P>
<P align=left>He should get up out of his bed and
go chop some wood to replenish their stock. He needed to gather ice to make
drinking water, and he needed to go hunting, to try to find something for them
to eat, and to do so many other things. &quot;But on the least movement, especially
rapid, I am puffing like a freight locomotive,&quot; he recorded. He wished Crawford
and the others would come back because he could see now that it was going to be
hard for Ada if he became completely bedridden. </P>
<P align=left>For now, she seemed cheerful enough,
but he wondered how much of it was for show, to make him feel better, and to
make herself feel better. He thought she was probably more frightened and
distressed about his illness than he was, although she wasn't showing it to him.
He could hear her outside sharpening the wood saw. She had told him she would do
everything that needed to be done around camp until he felt better and could get
up again and take care of everything as he had before, and he had no choice but
to let her. </P>
<P align=left>Ada was terrified of running into a
polar bear while she was out checking the traps. She carried a snow knife with
her, but that was all, because she was still frightened of rifles, and she knew
she wouldn't have the slightest idea how to defend herself if she was caught by
Nanook. While she was out walking, she would pause now and then, every so often,
and have a look around for bears, knowing she would faint if she so much as
caught a glimpse of one. </P>
<P align=left>She went out every day now, looking
for food. There was nothing at camp, and Knight was too weak to hunt, too weak
to do anything but rest in bed. Ada herself was feeling listless and tired, and
very much alone. She missed Crawford and Galle and Maurer, but particularly
Crawford and Galle. Everything had changed drastically and suddenly when they
went away. Now Knight was sick and she must figure out how to help him and what
to do to keep them fed, and she wished the men would come back and help her. She
wanted to give up the trapping because there were never any foxes and it made
her weary to walk all those miles every single day. Also, daylight hours were
still minimal and she worried about being caught in the dark miles from camp. </P>
<P align=left>But she made herself go out,
following Maurer's map until she learned the way herself, and one afternoon, she
spotted some fox tracks circling around the traps, and she knelt down and dug
the trap out of the snow. It was empty, and Ada figured she must have hidden it
under too much snow last time. So she baited the trap again, leaving it
uncovered. </P>
<P align=left>The next morning, when she checked
the traps, she found a fox lying in one of them. Her first one. Ada was proud
and exhilarated. No one had told her how to fix the trap or to uncover it and
leave it in the open. She had figured that out on her own and now she would have
food to take to Knight. The very best part of it was that she had done it all
herself.
