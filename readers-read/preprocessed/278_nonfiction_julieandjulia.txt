 day 1 recipe 1 the road to hell is paved with leeks and potatoes as far as i know the only evidence supporting the theory that julia child first made potage parmentier during a bad bout of ennui is her own recipe for it she writes that potage parmentier which is just a frenchie way of saying potato soup smells good tastes good and is simplicity itself to make it is the first recipe in the first book she ever wrote she concedes that you can add carrots or broccoli or green beans if you want but that seems beside the point if what youre looking for is simplicity itself simplicity itself it sounds like poetry doesnt it it sounds like just what the doctor ordered it wasnt what my doctor ordered though my doctormy gynecologist to be specific ordered a baby there are the hormonal issues in your case with the pcos you know about that already and you are pushing thirty after all look at it this way there will never be a better time this was not the first time id heard this it had been happening for a couple of years now ever since id sold some of my eggs for 7500 in order to pay off credit card debt actually that was the second time id donated a funny way of putting it since when you wake up from the anesthesia less a few dozen ova and get dressed theres a check for thousands of dollars with your name on it waiting at the receptionists desk the first time was five years ago when i was twentyfour impecunious and fancyfree i hadnt planned on doing it twice but three years later i got a call from a doctor with an unidentifiable european accent who asked me if id be interested in flying down to florida for a second goround because our clients were very satisfied with the results of your initial donation egg donation is still a newenough technology that our slowly evolving legal and etiquette systems have not yet quite caught up nobody knows if egg donators are going to be getting sued for child support ten years down the line or what so discussions on the subject tend to be knotted with imprecise pronouns and euphemisms the upshot of this phone call though was that there was a little me running around tampa or somewhere and the little mes parents were happy enough with him or her that they wanted a matched set the honest part of me wanted to shout wait no when they start hitting puberty youll regret this but 7500 is a lot of money anyway it was not until the second harvesting they actually call it harvesting fertility clinics it turns out use a lot of vaguely apocalyptic terms that i found out i had polycystic ovarian syndrome which sounds absolutely terrifying but apparently just meant that i was going to get hairy and fat and id have to take all kinds of drugs to conceive which means i guess that i havent heard my last of cryptoreligious obstetric jargon so ever since i was diagnosed with this pcos two years ago doctors have been obsessing over my childbearing prospects ive even been given the pushing thirty speech by my avuncular whitehaired orthopedist what kind of twentynineyearold has a herniated disk i ask you at least my gynecologist had some kind of business in my private parts maybe thats why i heroically did not start bawling immediately when he said this as he was wiping off his speculum once he left however i did fling one of my navy faille pumps at the place where his head had been just a moment before the heel hit the door with a thud leaving a black scuff mark then dropped onto the counter where it knocked over a glass jar of cotton swabs i scooped up all the qtips from the counter and the floor and started to stuff them back into the jar before realizing id probably gotten them all contaminated so then i shoved them into a pile next to an apothecary jar full of fresh needles and squeezed myself back into the vintage forties suit id been so proud of that morning when nate from work told me it made my waist look small while subtly eyeing my cleavage but which on the ride from lower manhattan to the upper east side on an unairconditioned 6 train had gotten sweatstained and rumpled then i slunk out of the room fifteenbuck copay already in hand the better to make my escape before anyone discovered id trashed the place as soon as i got belowground i knew there was a problem even before i reached the turnstiles i heard a low subterranean rumble echoing off the tiled walls and noticed more than the usual number of aimlesslooking people milling about a tangy whiff of disgruntlement wafted on the fetid air every once in a great while the announcement system would come on and announce something but none of these spatterings of word salad resulted in the arrival of a train not for a long long time along with everyone else i leaned out over the platform edge hoping to see the pale yellow of a trains headlight glinting off the track but the tunnel was black i smelled like a rainedupon nervous sheep my feet in their navy heels with the bows on the toe were killing me as was my back and the platform was so crammed with people that before long i began to worry someone was going to fall off the edge onto the trackspossibly me or maybe the person i was going to push during my imminent psychotic break but then magically the crowd veered away for a split second i thought the stink coming off my suit had reached a deadly new level but the wary amused looks on the faces of those edging away werent focused on me i followed their gaze to a plug of a woman her head of saltandpepper hair shorn into the sort of crew cut they give to the mentally disabled who had plopped down on the concrete directly behind me i could see the whorls of her cowlick like a fingerprint feel the tingle of invaded personal space against my shins the woman was muttering to herself fiercely commuters had vacated a swath of platform all around the loon as instinctually as a herd of wildebeests evading a lioness i was the only one stuck in the dangerous blank circle the lost calf the old wornout cripple who couldnt keep up the loon started smacking her forehead with the heel of her palm fuck she yelled fuck fuck i couldnt decide whether it would be safer to edge back into the crowd or freeze where i was my breathing grew shallow as i turned my eyes blankly out across the tracks to the uptown platform that old subway chameleon trick the loon placed both palms down on the concrete in front of her and crack smacked her forehead hard on the ground this was a little much even for the surrounding crowd of new yorkers who of course all knew that loons and subways go together like peanut butter and chocolate the sickening noise of skull on concrete seemed to echo in the damp air as if she was using her specially evolved resonant brainpan as an instrument to call the crazies out from every farunderground branch of the city everybody flinched glancing around nervously with a squeak i hopped back into the multitude the loon had a smudgy black abrasion right in the middle of her forehead like the scuff mark my shoe had left on my gynecologists door but she just kept screeching the train pulled in and i connived to wiggle into the car the loon wasnt going into it was only once i was in the car squeezed in shoulder to shoulder the lot of us hanging by one hand from the overhead bar like slaughtered cows on the trundling train that it came to me as if some omnipotent god of city dwellers were whispering the truth in my earthat the only two reasons i hadnt joined right in with the loon with the gray crew cut beating my head and screaming fuck in primal syncopation were 1 id be embarrassed and 2 i didnt want to get my cute vintage suit any dirtier than it already was performance anxiety and a drycleaning bill those were the only things keeping me from stark raving lunacy thats when i started to cry when a tear dropped onto the pages of the new york post that the guy sitting beneath me was reading he just blew air noisily through his nose and turned to the sports pages when i got off the subway after what seemed like years i called eric from a pay phone at the corner of bay ridge and fourth avenue hey did you get anything for dinner eric made that little suckinginthroughhisteeth sound he always makes when he thinks hes about to get in trouble was i supposed to well i told you id be late because of my doctors appointment right right sorry i just i didnt you want me to order something in or dont worry about it ill pick up something or other but im going to start packing just as soon as the newshours done promise it was nearly eight oclock and the only market open in bay ridge was the korean deli on the corner of seventieth and third i must have looked a sight standing around in the produce aisle in my bedraggled suit my face tracked with mascara staring like a catatonic i couldnt think of a thing that i wanted to eat i grabbed some potatoes a bunch of leeks some hotel bar butter i felt dazed and somehow willless as if i was following a shopping list someone else had made i paid walked out of the shop and headed for the bus stop but just missed the b69 there wouldnt be another for a half hour at least at this time of night so i started the tenblock walk home carrying a plastic bag bristling with spiky dark leek bouquets it wasnt until almost fifteen minutes later as i was walking past the catholic boys school on shore road one block over from our apartment building that i realized that id managed unconsciously to buy exactly the ingredients for julia childs potage parmentier when i was a kid my dad used to love to tell the story about finding fiveyearold julie curled up in the back of his coppercolored datsun zx immersed in a crumpled back issue of the atlantic monthly he told that one to all the guys at his office and to the friends he and my mom went out to dinner with and to all of the family who werent born again and likely to disapprove of the atlantic not zcars i think the point behind this was that id been singled out as an early entrant to the ranks of the intellectually superior and since i was awful at ballet and tap dancing after all always the last one to make it up the rope in gym class a girl neither waifish nor charming in owlish redrimmed glasses i took my egopetting where i could get it but the notveryhighbrow truth of the matter was that the reading was how i got my yayas out for the sake of my bookish reputation i upgraded to tolstoy and steinbeck before i understood them but my dark secret was that really i preferred the junk the dragonriders of pern flowers in the attic the clan of the cave bear this stuff was like my stash of playboys under the mattress i waited until my camp counselor left the cabin to steal the v c andrews she stashed behind her box of tampax i nicked my moms jean auel and had already gotten halfway through before she found out so she could only wince and suppose there was some educational value but no valley of horses for you young lady then adolescence set in well and proper and reading for kicks got shoved in the backseat with the old atlantics it had been a long time since id done anything with the delicious licentious cluelessness that i used to read those books hell sex now wasnt as exciting as reading about sex used to be i guess nowadays your average fourteenyearold texan possesses exhaustive knowledge of the sexual uses of tongue studs but i doubt the information excites her any more than my revelations about neanderthal sex you know what a fourteenyearold texan doesnt know shit about french food a couple of weeks after my twentyninth birthday in the spring of 2002 i went back to texas to visit my parents actually eric kind of made me go you have to get out of here he said the kitchen drawer that broke two weeks after we moved in and was never satisfactorily rehabilitated had just careened off its tracks yet again flinging pottery barn silverware in all directions i was sobbing forks and knives glittering at my feet eric was holding me in one of those tight hugs like a half nelson which he does whenever hes trying to comfort me when what he really wants to do is smack me will you come with me i didnt look up from the snot stain i was impressing upon his shirt im too busy at the office right now besides i think its better if you go by yourself hang out with your mom buy some clothes sleep in i have work though julie youre a temp whats temping for if you cant run off and take a break sometimes thats why youre doing it right i didnt like to think about why i was temping my voice went high and cracked well i cant afford it we can afford it or we can ask your parents to pay he grabbed my chin and lifted it up to his face julie seriously go because i cant live with you like this anymore so i went my mom bought me the ticket for a late birthday present a week later i flew into austin early enough to grab lunch at pokejos and then right in the middle of my brisket sandwich and okra less than a month after i turned twentynine mom dropped the pushing thirty bomb for the very first time jesus mom what my mother has this bright smiling hard tone that she always uses when she wants me to face facts she was using it now all im saying is here you are miserable running away from new york getting into a bad place with eric and for what youre getting older youre not taking advantage of the city why do this to yourself this was exactly the one thing i had come to austin to not talk about i should have known my mother would dig in like a goddamned rat terrier i had gone to new york like everybody else goes to new york just as the essential first step for a potato destined for soup is to have its skin peeled off the essential starting point for an aspiring actor is to move to new york i preferred jobs that did not require auditions which since i neither looked like ren233e zellweger nor was a terribly good actor proved to be a problem mostly what id done was temp for to name a few the photocopier contractor for the un the asian american businesses underwriting department at aig the vice president of a broadband technology outfit with an amazing office looking out onto the brooklyn bridge which folded about two weeks after i got there and an investment firm specializing in the money matters of nunneries recently id started work at a government agency downtown it looked like they were going to offer to bring me on permanently eventually all the temp employers offered to let you go perm and for the first time i was considering in a despairing sort of way doing it it was enough to make me suicidal even before my mom started telling me i was getting old mom should have known this but instead of apologizing for her cruelty she just popped another piece of fried okra into her mouth and said lets go shopping your clothes are just awful the next morning i lingered at my parents kitchen table long after theyd both left for work wrapped up in a wellworn gray flannel robe id forgotten i had sipping coffee id finished the times crossword and all the sections except for business and circuits but didnt yet have enough caffeine in my system to contemplate getting dressed id overindulged in margaritas the night before not at all an unusual occurrence when visiting the folks in austin the pantry door stood ajar and my aimless gaze rested on the bookshelves inside the familiar ranks of spines lined up there when i got up to fill my cup one last time i made a detour and took one of the books mastering the art of french cooking vol 1 my moms old 1967 edition a book that had known my familys kitchen longer than i had i sat back down at the table at which id eaten a thousand childhood afternoon snacks and began flipping through just for the hell of it when i was a kid i used to look at mtaofc quite a lot partly it was just my obsession with anything between two covers but there was something else too because this book has the power to shock mtaofc is still capable of striking deep if obscure zones of discomfort find the most pale pierced and kohleyed proudly pervy hipster you can and ask her to cook p226t233 de canard en crote aided only by the helpful illustrations on pages 571 through 575 i promise you shell be fleeing back to williamsburg where no ones going to make her bone a whole duck faster than you can say trucker hats are soooo five minutes ago but why what is it about this book its just an old cookbook for gods sake yet vegetarians atkinsers and south beach bums flare their nostrils at the stink of apostasy between its covers selfproclaimed foodies spare a smile of fond condescension before returning to their chez panisse cookbooks by all rights i should feel this way too i am after all that ultimate synthesis of urban flakiness and suburban selfrighteousness the new york actress well actually i guess i cant say that since ive never had a real acting job and to tell the truth its time i faced facts here i never really even tried but if im not a new york actress what am i im a person who takes a subway from the outer boroughs to a lower manhattan office every morning who spends her days answering phones and doing copying who is too disconsolate when she gets back to her apartment at night to do anything but sit on the couch and stare vacantly at reality tv shows until she falls asleep oh god it really was true wasnt it i really was a secretary when i looked up from mtaofc for the first time half an hour after i opened it i realized that deep down id been resigned to being a secretary for months maybe even years that was the bad news the good news was that the buzzing in my head and queasy but somehow exhilarating squeeze deep in my belly were reminding me that i might still after all be something else do you know mastering the art of french cooking you must at least know of it its a cultural landmark for petes sake even if you just think of it as the book by that lady who looks like dan aykroyd and bleeds a lot you know of it but do you know the book itself try to get your hands on one of the early hardback editions theyre not exactly rare for a while there every american housewife who could boil water had a copy or so ive heard its not lushly illustrated there are no shiny softcore images of the glossyhaired author sinking her teeth into a juicy strawberry or smiling stonily before a perfectly rustic tart with carving knife in hand like some chilly blonde kitchen dominatrix the dishes are hopelessly dated the cooking times outrageously long the use of butter and cream beyond the pale and not a single reference to pancetta or sea salt or wasabi this book hasnt been on the musthave list for enterprising gourmands in decades but as i held it in my hands that morning opened its cover spangled with tomatocolored fleursdelys skimmed through its yellowed pages i felt like id at last found something important why i bent again over the books pages searching for the cause of this strange feeling it wasnt the food exactly if you looked hard enough the food started to feel almost beside the point no there was something deeper here some code within the words perhaps some secret embedded in the paper itself i have never looked to religion for comfort belief is just not in my genes but reading mastering the art of french cooking childishly simple and dauntingly complex incantatory and comforting i thought this was what prayer must feel like sustenance bound up with anticipation and want reading mtaofc was like reading pornographic bible verses so naturally when i flew back to new york that may i had moms copy of the book stashed in my bag the thing you learn with potage parmentier is that simple is not exactly the same as easy it had never occurred to me that there was a difference until eric and i sat down on our couch the night of my appointment at the gynecologists three months after stealing my mothers fortyyearold cookbook and took our first slurps of julia childs potato soup certainly i had made easier dinners unwrapping a cellophaneswathed hunk of london broil and tossing it under the broiler was one method that came immediately to mind ordering pizza and getting drunk on stoli gimlets while waiting for it to arrive that was another favorite potage parmentier didnt even hold a candle in the easy department first you peel a couple of potatoes and slice them up slice some leeks rinse them a couple of times to get rid of the grit leeks are muddy little suckers throw these two ingredients in a pot with some water and some salt simmer it for fortyfive minutes or so then either mash the vegetables in the soup with a fork or pass them through a food mill i didnt have a food mill and i wasnt about to mash up vegetables with a fork what i had was a potato ricer well technically it was erics potato ricer before we were married years ago before atkins hit mashed potatoes used to be erics specialty for a while before we learned the value of brooklyn storage space wed had this tradition where id get him arcane kitchen gadgets the notveryfunny joke being that he didnt actually cook at all except for the mashed potatoes the ricer is the only survivor from this period it was his christmas present the year we were in the railroad apartment on eleventh between seventh and eighththis was before we got priced out of park slope entirely id sewn stockings for the both of us out of felt his is red with white trim mine white with redfrom a pattern in the martha stewart living holiday issue that year we still have them even though i cant sew and theyre totally kattywhompus the stitching uneven the decorative cuffs bunched and crooked theyre also way too small for things like ricers i stuffed it in anyway hanging on the mantel of the nonfunctional fireplace in the bedroom the stocking looked like santa had brought eric a luger ive never been much good at stocking stuffers once the leeks and potatoes have simmered for an hour or so you mash them up with a fork or a food mill or a potato ricer all three of these options are far more of a pain in the neck than the cuisinartone of which spacemunching behemoths we scored when we got married but julia child allows as how a cuisinart will turn soup into something unfrench and monotonous any suggestion that uses the construction unfrench is up for debate but if you make potage parmentier you will see her point if you use the ricer the soup will have bits green bits and white bits and yellow bits instead of being utterly smooth after youve mushed it up just stir in a couple of hefty chunks of butter and youre done jc says sprinkle with parsley but you dont have to it looks pretty enough as it is and it smells glorious which is funny when you think about it theres not a thing in it but leeks potatoes butter water pepper and salt one interesting thing to meditate on while youre making this soup is potatoes theres something about peeling a potato not to say that its fun exactly but theres something about scraping off the skin and rinsing off the dirt and chopping it into cubes before immersing the cubes in cold water because theyll turn pink if you let them sit out in the air something about knowing exactly what youre doing and why potatoes have been potatoes for a long long time and people have treated them in just this way toward the end of making just such a soup there is clarity in the act of peeling a potato a winnowing down to one sure true way and even if afterward you do push it through some gadget you got at crate and barrel the peeling is still a part of what you do the first thing i was supposed to have spent my twenties a hammering away for ninety hours a week at some highpaying ethically dubious job drinking heavily and having explosive sex with a rich array of twentysomething men b awaking at noon every day in my williamsburg loft to work on my paintingpoetryknitting performance art easily shaking off the effects of stylish drugs and tragically hip clubs and explosive sex with a rich array of twentysomething men and women if i could manage it or c pursuing higher education sweating bullets over an obscure dissertation and punctuating my intellectual throes with some pot and explosive sex with a rich array of professors and undergrads these were the models for someone like me but i did none of these things instead i got married i didnt mean to exactly it just kind of happened eric and i were high school sweethearts wait it gets worse we were in a high school play together our courtship was straight out of one of the ickier films from the john hughes oeuvre some kind of wonderful maybeall kinds of misunderstandings and jealous boyfriends and angstridden stage kisses in other words the sort of tootypical high school romance that people of our generation are meant to get over and cover up later on but we didnt somehow we never got around to the breakingup part at the age of twentyfour when we were still sleeping together and reasonably satisfied with the whole toiletseatandtoothpastecap situation we went ahead and got married please understand i love my husband like a pig loves shit maybe even more but in the circles i run in being married for more than five years before reaching the age of thirty ranks real high on the list of most socially damaging traits right below watching nascar and listening to shania twain im used to getting questions like is he the only person youve ever had sex with or even more insultingly are you the only person hes ever had sex with all this to say that sometimes i get a little defensive even with isabel who ive known since kindergarten and sally my freshmanyear roommate and gwen who comes over to eat at our apartment every weekend and adores eric i would confess to none of them the thing i sometimes think which is eric can be a little pushy i couldnt hack the hastily smothered expressions of dismay and smug itoldyouso eyebrows i know my friends would imagine something between the the stepford wives and a domestic abuse psa narrated by jlo but i mean neither shoving matches nor domineering at dinner parties i just mean that he pushes he cant be satisfied with telling me im the most gorgeous and talented woman on the planet and that he would die without me while mixing me a dry stoli gimlet no he has to encourage he has to make suggestions it can be most annoying so i made this soup this potage parmentier from a recipe in a fortyyearold cookbook id stolen from my mother the previous spring and it was good inexplicably good we ate it sitting on the couch bowls perched on knees the silence broken only by the occasional snort of laughter as we watched a pert blonde high school student dust vampires on the television in almost no time we were slurping the dregs of our third servings it turns out that one reason were so good together is that each of us eats more and faster than anyone either of us has ever met also we both recognize the genius of buffy the vampire slayer earlier that evening after the gynecologist appointment when i was standing in the korean deli staring at produce id been thinking im twentynine im never going to have kids or a real job my husband will leave me and ill die alone in an outerborough hovel with twenty cats and itll take two weeks for the stench to reach the hall but now three bowls of potato soup later i was to my relief thinking of nothing much at all i lay on my back on the couch quietly digesting julia childs soup had made me vulnerable eric saw an in and took it that was good honey i sighed my agreement real good and there wasnt even any meat in it eric is a sensitive twentyfirstcentury sort of guy but a texan nevertheless and the idea of a dinner without animal flesh gets him a little panicky youre such a good cook julie maybe you should go to culinary school id started cooking in college basically to keep eric in my thrall in the years since though the whole thing had blown a little out of proportion i dont know if eric felt pride that he had introduced me to my consuming passion or guilt that my urge to satisfy his innocent liking for escargot and rhubarb had metastasized into an unhealthy obsession whatever the reason this thing about cooking school had developed into one of our habitual deadend alleys of conversation i was too deliciously idle after my soup to get ticked off about it and just snorted quietly even that indication that he had my ear though was a tactical error i knew it as soon as id made a sound i squeezed my eyes shut feigning sudden sleep or deafness seriously you could go to the culinary institute we could move out to the hudson valley and you could just spend all your time learning to be a chef and then no sooner than id cautioned myself against it i made tactical error 2 they wont let me in without professional experience id have to go peel potatoes for twofifty an hour for six months you want to support me with all your big bucks while i do that giving in to the enticing prospect of emasculating my husband always always a mistake maybe some other school to start then somewhere here in the city we cant afford it eric didnt answer he sat quietly on the edge of the couch with his hand on my shin i thought about kicking it off but the shin seemed a neutral enough spot one of the cats jumped up onto my chest sniffed my breath then stalked off stifflegged her mouth open in faint disgust if i wanted to learn to cook id just cook my way through mastering the art of french cooking it was an odd sort of statement to make drip with sarcasm but i managed it anyway eric just sat there not that it would do me any good of course cant get a job out of that at least wed eat good for a while now i was the one who said nothing for a moment because of course he was right about that id be exhausted all the time id get fat wed have to eat brains and eggs i dont eat eggs eric you know i dont eat eggs no you dont its a stupid idea eric said nothing for a while buffy had ended and the news was ona correspondent was standing on a flooded street in sheepshead bay saying something about a broken water main we sat on the couch in our stuffy bay ridge living room staring at the screen as if we gave a damn all around us teetered towers of boxes the looming reminder of our upcoming move when i look back on it now it is as if i could actually hear the taut creak of a fisherman giving out just a tiny bit of line when eric said you could start a blog i cut my eyes over to him in irritation a massive whiteskinned shark thrashing its tail julie you do know what a blog is dont you of course i didnt know what a blog was it was august of 2002 nobody knew about blogs except for a few guys like eric who spend their days using company computers to pursue the zeitgeist no issue of domestic or international policy was too big no popculture backwater too obscure from the war on terror to fear factor it was all one big beautiful sliding scale for eric you know like a web site sort of thing only its easy you dont have to know anything about anything sounds perfect for me about computers i mean are you going to make me that drink or what sure and he did he left me alone he was free to now that he knew the hook was sunk lulled by the calming music of ice clattering in the cocktail shaker i began to ponder this life we had going for ourselves eric and i it felt like the opposite of potage parmentier it was easy enough to keep on with the soulsucking jobs at least it saved having to make a choice but how much longer could i take such an easy life quicksand was easy hell death was easy maybe thats why my synapses had started snapping at the sight of potatoes and leeks in the korean deli maybe that was what was plucking deep down in my belly whenever i thought of julia childs book maybe i needed to make like a potato winnow myself down be a part of something that was not easy just simple just then eric emerged again from the kitchen carrying two stoli gimlets he handed off one of the glasses to me carefully so as not to spill anything over those treacherous martini lips and i took a sip eric always made the best gimlets icy cold very dry with an almostnotthere shade of chartreuse lingering in their slightly oily depths okay i said taking another sip as eric sat down beside me tell me again about this blog thing and so late that evening a tiny line dropped into the endless sea of cyberspace the slenderest of lures in the blackest of waters the book mastering the art of french cooking first edition 1961 louisette bertholle simone beck and of course julia child the woman who taught america to cook and to eat today we think we live in the world alice waters made but beneath it all is julia and no one can touch her the contender government drone by day renegade foodie by night too old for theater too young for children and too bitter for anything else julie powell was looking for a challenge and in the juliejulia project she found it risking her marriage her job and her cats wellbeing she has signed on for a deranged assignment 365 days 524 recipes one girl and a crappy outerborough kitchen how far it will go no one can say it wasnt much nearly nothing in fact not even so much as a recipe for potato soup a few words strung together is all but together out there they seemed perhaps to glow only faintly just enough
