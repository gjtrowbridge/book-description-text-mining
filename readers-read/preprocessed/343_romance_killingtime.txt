 june 27 2005 8220hey knox who dug that hole next to the flagpole8221 knox looked up from the report he was writing as chief county investigator he had his own office though it was small and crowded deputy jason macfarland was leaning in through the open door the expression on his freckled face only mildly curious 8220what hole next to the flagpole8221 8220i8217m telling you there8217s a hole next to the flagpole i8217d swear it wasn8217t there yesterday afternoon when my shift was over but one8217s there now8221 8220huh8221 knox rubbed his jaw he himself hadn8217t noticed because he8217d parked behind the courthouse when he came in this morning at fourthirty to wade through an assdeep pile of paperwork he8217d been up all night and he was so tired he might not have noticed even if he8217d walked right by the supposed hole having been sitting at his desk for three hours he figured he needed to stretch his legs a bit grabbing his coffee cup he refilled it as he passed by the coffeemaker and he and deputy macfarland went out the side door then walked around the side of the redbrick courthouse building to the front their rubbersoled shoes quiet on the sidewalk the new day was showing a cloudless blue sky and the lush green grass was wet with dew colorful banks of spring flowers grew in carefully tended beds but knox would have been hard put to name any of them he knew roses and daffodils everything else was lumped under the general designation of 8220flowers8221 the courthouse opened at eight and the back parking lot was rapidly filling with employees8217 cars the sheriff8217s department had a separate wing on the right of the courthouse and the county jail occupied the top two stories of the fivestory building the prisoners used to catcall down to the female employees and visitors to the courthouse until the county installed slats over the windows that let in air and light but effectively blocked the prisoners8217 view of the parking lot below the flagpole was on the left front corner of the courthouse square park benches faced the street on both sides of the corner and there were more of the neat flower beds today there wasn8217t any wind the flags hung limply and at the base of the flagpole was a nicesized hole about three feet wide and two deep knox and the deputy stayed on the sidewalk they could easily see from there a granite slab had been flipped upside down and lay in the grass the dirt was scattered more than seemed strictly necessary for digging a simple hole 8220that was the time capsule8221 knox said and sighed this was just the kind of shit high school kids would do but it ate at his time just like any other crime 8220what time capsule8221 macfarland asked 8220there was a time capsule buried hell it was twenty years ago 1985 i watched them bury it on new year8217s day8221 8220what was in it8221 8220i don8217t remember but nothing struck me at the time as being valuable things like a copy of the newspaper a yearbook some music and things8221 he did remember that the newspaper hadn8217t listed everything in the capsule though and in retrospect he was still pissed off about it 8220bunch of kids most likely8221 macfarland said 8220thought stealing a time capsule would be funny8221 8220yeah8221 out of habit knox surveyed the surrounding ground there were no footprints in the dew which meant the van dals had struck hours ago he stepped up on one of the park benches so he could get a better view and said 8220huh8221 8220what is it8221 8220nothing no footprints8221 the way the fresh dirt was scattered around there should have been at least a partial footprint caught somewhere but the dirt looked as if it had burst up out of the ground rather than been dug up and tossed with a shovel the flagpole was no more than ten feet distant from the park bench so he had a very good view there was no way he was overlooking any prints there simply weren8217t any macfarland climbed up on the bench beside him 8220don8217t that beat all8221 he said after staring at the ground for at least thirty seconds 8220how8217d they manage that i wonder8221 8220god only knows8221 he8217d find out though because the county jail was located at the courthouse every corner of the building was equipped with a security camera tucked up high under the eaves and painted to blend in with the building unless a person knew the cameras were there he8217d have a tough time spotting them he still had that report to finish but the lack of footprints around the hole fired his curiosity now he had to know just how the little bastards had managed to dig up the time capsule with a streetlight right there on the corner shining down on them but with no one seeing them and without leaving any prints in the fresh dirt maybe first avenue the street right in front of the courthouse didn8217t have all that much traffic on it during the wee hours but there were always patrol cars coming and going someone should have seen something and reported it he looked across the street at the hardware store where he and his dad had lived after he8217d gone off to college his dad had finally gotten serious about someone and remarried about ten years ago knox liked lynnette just fine and was glad kelvin wasn8217t alone lynnette hadn8217t wanted to live above the store though so they8217d bought a house out in the country if kelvin had still lived there knox thought no kids would have managed to do anything without kelvin noticing because his bedroom had looked out over the square 8220put some tape around the scene keep people from tromping all over it8221 he instructed macfarland macfarland could have argued that there was nothing there but a hole and that a missing time capsule didn8217t have any great value anyway8212certainly not enough value to justify an investigation8212but he merely nodded telling knox when to back off was the sheriff8217s job not his besides knox was a source of great amusement to the deputies who sometimes made bets on how far he would go to solve a puzzle he and macfarland retraced their steps around the courthouse to the sheriff8217s department where they parted company macfarland to carry out his instructions and knox to the jail where the security cameras were manned 8220manned8221 was a loose term because more accurately they were 8220womanned8221 by a sixfoot fierceeyed woman named tarana wilson who kept fanatical watch over her domain her facial features were carved and strong her skin burnished like dark bronze and she had a brownbelt in martial arts knox strongly suspected she could kick his ass because a smart man never approached a queen without bearing gifts knox snagged a creamfilled doughnut out of the break room and poured two fresh cups of coffee one for himself and one in a disposable cup gifts in hand he went up the stairs he had to stop and identify himself then he was buzzed into the jailor8217s offices the actual cells were on the floors above and access to those floors was rigidly controlled they hadn8217t had a breakout in at least fifteen years not that peke county had any real hard cases in the county lockup the hard cases were in state prisons the door to tarana8217s office was open and she was pacing in front of a bank of ten blackandwhite monitors she seldom just sat she seemed to be constantly on the move as if too much energy burned in her lean longmuscled body for her to sit still 8220hey t8221 knox said as he strolled in extending the cup of coffee she eyed the cup suspiciously then looked back at the monitors 8220what8217s that8221 8220coffee8221 8220what8217re you bringing me coffee for8221 8220to stay on your good side i8217m afraid of you8221 that brought her dark narroweyed gaze swinging back to him 8220liar8221 8220okay so i really have the hots for you and this is my way of softening you up8221 a faint smile curved her mouth she took the cup of coffee and sipped it as she studied the monitors 8220it might work too if me and my sisters hadn8217t sworn an oath to stay away from white boys8221 he snorted then extended the doughnut 8220this is for you too8221 8220now i8217m gettin8217 scared you really meant that about softening me up but i got news for you it takes more than any doughnut to do the job8221 8220it8217s creamfilled8221 8220oh well then i might have to rethink my position8221 she grabbed the doughnut and took a big bite out of it squishing white cream out both sides of the pastry she licked the cream filling before it could splat to the floor her attention never leaving the monitors 8220now then what can i do for you8221 8220see the flagpole8221 he asked pointing at the appropriate monitor 8220yeah what about it8221 8220there8217s a hole in front of it where the time capsule used to be buried8221 8220used to be8221 8220somebody dug it up last night8221 8220son of a bitch somebody stole our time capsule i didn8217t know we had one but never mind that8221 8220i need to see the tape from last night8221 8220coming right up that8217s just trashy stealing a town8217s time capsule8221 in short order knox was sitting in front of a spare monitor rewinding the security tape and watching as everything went backward he saw himself and macfarland then time spooled backward and dawn disappeared traffic had been light as he expected what he didn8217t expect though was to see no one approach the flagpole and spend a few minutes digging a hole not a single person approached he was all the way back to sunset when he stopped the tape frowning 8220you find the lowdown rotten bastard8221 tarana drawled without looking at him because she was still visually patrolling her monitors 8220nope8221 looking closely at the frozen image he could plainly see that the granite marker was in place and the ground undisturbed at eightthirty pm the rich green grass was neatly trimmed around the marker 8220what do you mean no8221 8220i mean i didn8217t see anybody8221 8220don8217t tell me somebody done dug up that time capsule a week ago and you boys have just noticed8221 8220according to your tape it was still there at sunset yesterday8221 she wheeled stared at the image 8220if it was there yesterday then whoever took it8217s on that tape8221 8220i didn8217t see anyone8221 he repeated patiently and fast forwarded through to dawn to show her when he stopped the tape they could see the hole at the base of the flagpole and the granite marker flipped off to the side a ferocious frown pulled her brows together 8220run it again8221 she snapped coming to stand behind him he did rewinding the tape yet again and this time doing periodic stops of the tape to see when the vandalism first appeared at 230 am the hole was there when he stopped it again at 153 am the site was undisturbed 8220now run it in real time8221 she said dragging a chair over she gave her monitors a quick look then settled her attention on the tape playing in front of her knox punched play and the timecounter began clicking forward a second at a time seven minutes later he said 8220shit what was that8221 a brief white flash had glared on the screen then it was gone and so was the time capsule he stopped the tape hit rewind then almost immediately hit play again the tape had backed up three minutes the same thing happened the ground was undisturbed then came that white flash and when it faded the capsule was gone 8220somebody8217s messing with my camera8221 tarana said in a voice of doom 8220i don8217t think so8221 frowning knox rewound the tape over those same few crucial minutes 8220watch the timer8221 together they watched the seconds ticking away at 200 am the white flash filled the screen at 201 am the flash faded and the time capsule was gone 8220that8217s not possible8221 tarana snapped surging to her feet and kicking her chair she turned and glared at all the monitors 8220if somebody8217s messing with that camera he can mess with all these and that ain8217t gonna happen8221 silently knox watched the sequence again he hadn8217t noticed the flash when he8217d been fastforwarding or rewinding but it was definitely there and the granite slab had been in place before the flash but was pushed aside afterward and the dark hole gaped at the foot of the flagpole he rewound the tape all the way the time display was exactly twentyfour hours before he8217d come in here and tarana had stopped the tape he didn8217t know if anyone could tamper with the tape without messing up the time or if it was even possible without someone coming into this office in which case no way had a bunch of high school kids been responsible he scratched his jaw he supposed he could sit with his watch in one hand and time the tape but that would take twentyfour hours and be boring as hell besides there was an easier way to get to the bottom of this tarana was stalking back and forth behind him breathing fire and muttering curses knox felt sorry for the next person who came through that door because deprived of a definite target she might just take her ire out on anyone handy 8220i8217m going over to the hardware store8221 he said sliding his chair back and grabbing his coffee cup 8220hardware store what you going to the hardware store for you can8217t just waltz in here and show me somebody8217s been messing with my cameras then just waltz out again to go buy some nails you sit back down8221 8220dad has security cameras too8221 knox said 8220one of them is pointed toward the door8221 8220so8221 she snapped then realization dawned 8220oh i gotcha glass door big glass storefront right across the street from the flagpole8221 he winked at her as he went out the door the square was busy now as he crossed the street peo ple were coming to the courthouse taking care of business like car tags driver8217s licenses boat registrations some of the stores were open including the hardware store the rest of them opened at nine macfarland had strung a nice crimescene perimeter blocking off a good twenty yards in either direction from the flagpole thereby blocking the sidewalk and making people walk around the bell above the door dinged when knox walked in and kelvin looked up as he was checking out a customer 8220be with you in a minute son8221 he said 8220take your time8221 looking up knox located the secu rity camera and turned to follow the alignment just as he8217d thought the flagpole was almost dead center opposite the front door whoever had done the vandalism might have somehow blocked the courthouse security camera though he didn8217t see how but this camera was inside the store and hadn8217t been tampered with the customer left and knox went over to the checkout counter 8220i need to see your security tape8221 he said to kelvin he nodded out the window 8220somebody dug up the time capsule last night and somehow blocked the courthouse camera i figure your camera caught the action8221 kelvin looked up at the camera following the path the same way knox had 8220reckon so i wondered what all that yellow tape was for that8217s the time capsule we watched them bury right8221 8220the same one unless they dug it up and buried a fresh one that i don8217t know about8221 8220nineteen eightyfive southern cal won the rose bowl and i had to listen to that asshole aaron for a whole year8221 kelvin always referred to his brotherinlaw aaron as 8220asshole aaron8221 because he liked the alliteration he didn8217t however like his brotherinlaw reaching beneath the counter he ejected a tape and handed it over the counter to knox 8220there you go8221 8220i don8217t know when i8217ll get it back8221 8220don8217t worry about it i got extras8221 tape in hand knox went back to his office he had a small tvvcr combo and he turned it on then slipped in the tape with the remote in his hand he rewound until he was close to the right time then in fits and starts until 159 am showed on the clock display the detail wasn8217t as good and the glass distorted the view some but he could make out the square granite marker right where it was supposed to be he pressed play and watched there was always some variance in clocks so he had no idea how long he8217d actually have to watch at 20317 there was a white flash knox sat up straight staring at the screen at 20318 the flash faded now the pale square of the granite marker was lying off to the side and the ground had been disturbed 8220son of a bitch8221 he said softly 8220what in hell is going on
