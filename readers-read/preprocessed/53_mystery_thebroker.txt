 chapter 1 in the waning hours of a presidency that was destined to arouse less interest from historians than any since perhaps that of william henry harrison thirtyone days from inauguration to death arthur morgan huddled in the oval office with his last remaining friend and pondered his final decisions at that moment he felt as though hersquod botched every decision in the previous four years and he was not overly confident that he could somehow so late in the game get things right his friend wasnrsquot so sure either though as always he said little and whatever he did say was what the president wanted to hear they were about pardonsmdashdesperate pleas from thieves and embezzlers and liars some still in jail and some whorsquod never served time but who nonetheless wanted their good names cleared and their beloved rights restored all claimed to be friends or friends of friends or diehard supporters though only a few had ever gotten the chance to proclaim their support before that eleventh hour how sad that after four tumultuous years of leading the free world it would all fizzle into one miserable pile of requests from a bunch of crooks which thieves should be allowed to steal again that was the momentous question facing the president as the hours crept by the last friend was critz an old fraternity pal from their days at cornell when morgan ran the student government while critz stuffed the ballot boxes in the past four years critz had served as press secretary chief of staff national security advisor and even secretary of state though that appointment lasted for only three months and was hastily rescinded when critzrsquos unique style of diplomacy nearly ignited world war iii critzrsquos last appointment had taken place the previous october in the final frantic weeks of the reelection onslaught with the polls showing president morgan trailing badly in at least forty states critz seized control of the campaign and managed to alienate the rest of the country except arguably alaska it had been a historic election never before had an incumbent president received so few electoral votes three to be exact all from alaska the only state morgan had not visited at critzrsquos advice five hundred and thirtyfive for the challenger three for president morgan the word ldquolandsliderdquo did not even begin to capture the enormity of the shellacking once the votes were counted the challenger following bad advice decided to contest the results in alaska why not go for all 538 electoral votes he reasoned never again would a candidate for the presidency have the opportunity to completely whitewash his opponent to throw the mother of all shutouts for six weeks the president suffered even more while lawsuits raged in alaska when the supreme court there eventually awarded him the statersquos three electoral votes he and critz had a very quiet bottle of champagne president morgan had become enamored of alaska even though the certified results gave him a scant seventeenvote margin he should have avoided more states he even lost delaware his home where the onceenlightened electorate had allowed him to serve eight wonderful years as governor just as he had never found the time to visit alaska his opponent had totally ignored delawaremdashno organization to speak of no television ads not a single campaign stop and his opponent still took 52 percent of the vote critz sat in a thick leather chair and held a notepad with a list of a hundred things that needed to be done immediately he watched his president move slowly from one window to the next peering into the darkness dreaming of what might have been the man was depressed and humiliated at fiftyeight his life was over his career a wreck his marriage crumbling mrs morgan had already moved back to wilmington and was openly laughing at the idea of living in a cabin in alaska critz had secret doubts about his friendrsquos ability to hunt and fish for the rest of his life but the prospect of living two thousand miles from mrs morgan was very appealing they might have carried nebraska if the rather blueblooded first lady had not referred to the football team as the ldquosoonersrdquo the nebraska sooners overnight morgan fell so far in the polls in both nebraska and oklahoma that he never recovered and in texas she took a bite of prizewinning chili and began vomiting as she was rushed to the hospital a microphone captured her stillfamous words ldquohow can you backward people eat such a putrid messrdquo nebraska has five electoral votes texas has thirtyfour insulting the local football team was a mistake they could have survived but no candidate could overcome such a belittling description of texas chili what a campaign critz was tempted to write a book someone needed to record the disaster their partnership of almost forty years was ending critz had lined up a job with a defense contractor for 200000 a year and he would hit the lecture circuit at 50000 a speech if anybody was desperate enough to pay it after dedicating his life to public service he was broke and aging quickly and anxious to make a buck the president had sold his handsome home in georgetown for a huge profit hersquod bought a small ranch in alaska where the people evidently admired him he planned to spend the rest of his days there hunting fishing perhaps writing his memoirs whatever he did in alaska it would have nothing to do with politics and washington he would not be the senior statesman the grand old man of anybodyrsquos party the sage voice of experience no farewell tours convention speeches endowed chairs of political science no presidential library the people had spoken with a clear and thunderous voice if they didnrsquot want him then he could certainly live without them ldquowe need to make a decision about cuccinellordquo critz saidnbsp the president was still standing at a window looking at nothing in the darkness still pondering delaware ldquowhordquo ldquofiggy cuccinello that movie director who was indicted for having sex with a young starletrdquo ldquohow youngrdquo ldquofifteen i thinkrdquo ldquothatrsquos pretty youngrdquo ldquoyes it is he fled to argentina wherersquos hersquos been for ten years now hersquos homesick wants to come back and start making dreadful movies again he says his art is calling him homerdquo ldquoperhaps the young girls are calling him homerdquo ldquothat toordquo ldquoseventeen wouldnrsquot bother me fifteenrsquos too youngrdquo ldquohis offer is up to five millionrdquo the president turned and looked at critz ldquohersquos offering five million for a pardonrdquo ldquoyes and he needs to move quickly the money has to be wired out of switzerland itrsquos three in the morning over thererdquo ldquowhere would it gordquo ldquowe have accounts offshore itrsquos easyrdquo ldquowhat would the press dordquo ldquoit would be uglyrdquo ldquoitrsquos always uglyrdquo ldquothis would be especially uglyrdquo ldquoi really donrsquot care about the pressrdquo morgan said then why did you ask critz wanted to say ldquocan the money be tracedrdquo the president asked and turned back to the window ldquonordquo with his right hand the president began scratching the back of his neck something he always did when wrestling with a difficult decision ten minutes before he almost nuked north korea hersquod scratched until the skin broke and blood oozed onto the collar of his white shirt ldquothe answer is nordquo he said ldquofifteen is too youngrdquo without a knock the door opened and artie morgan the presidentrsquos son barged in holding a heineken in one hand and some papers in the other ldquojust talked to the ciardquo he said casually he wore faded jeans and no socks ldquomaynardrsquos on the way overrdquo he dumped the papers on the desk and left the room slamming the door behind him artie would take the 5 million without hesitation critz thought to himself regardless of the girlrsquos age fifteen was certainly not too young for artie they might have carried kansas if artie hadnrsquot been caught in a topeka motel room with three cheerleaders the oldest of whom was seventeen a grandstanding prosecutor had finally dropped the chargesmdashtwo days after the electionmdashwhen all three girls signed affidavits claiming they had not had sex with artie they were about to in fact had been just seconds away from all manner of frolicking when one of their mothers knocked on the motel room door and prevented an orgy the president sat in his leather rocker and pretended to flip through some useless papers ldquowhatrsquos the latest on backmanrdquo he asked in his eighteen years as director of the cia teddy maynard had been to the white house less than ten times and never for dinner he always declined for health reasons and never to say howdy to a foreign hotshot he couldnrsquot have cared less back when he could walk he had occasionally stopped by to confer with whoever happened to be president and perhaps one or two of his policy makers now since he was in a wheelchair his conversations with the white house were by phonenbsp twice a vice president had actually been driven out to langley to meet with mr maynard the only advantage of being in a wheelchair was that it provided a wonderful excuse to go or stay or do whatever he damn well pleased no one wanted to push around an old crippled man a spy for almost fifty years he now preferred the luxury of looking directly behind himself when he moved about he traveled in an unmarked white vanmdashbulletproof glass lead walls two heavily armed boys perched behind the heavily armed drivermdashwith his wheelchair clamped to the floor in the rear and facing back so that teddy could see the traffic that could not see himnbsp two other vans followed at a distance and any misguided attempt to get near the director would be instantly terminated none was expected most of the world thought teddy maynard was either dead or idling away his final days in some secret nursing home where old spies were sent to die teddy wanted it that way he was wrapped in a heavy gray quilt and tended to by hoby his faithful aide as the van moved along the beltway at a constant sixty miles an hour teddy sipped green tea poured from a thermos by hoby and watched the cars behind them hoby sat next to the wheelchair on a leather stool made especially for him a sip of tea and teddy said ldquowherersquos backman right nowrdquo ldquoin his cellrdquo hoby answered ldquoand our people are with the wardenrdquo ldquotheyrsquore sitting in his office waitingrdquo another sip from a paper cup one carefully guarded with both hands the hands were frail veiny the color of skim milk as if they had already died and were patiently waiting for the rest of the body ldquohow long will it take to get him out of the countryrdquo ldquoabout four hoursrdquo ldquoand the plan is in placerdquo ldquoeverything is ready were waiting on the green lightrdquo ldquoi hope this moron can see it my wayrdquo critz and the moron were staring at the walls of the oval office their heavy silence broken occasionally by a comment about joel backman they had to talk about something because neither would mention what was really on his mind can this be happening is this finally the end forty years from cornell to the oval office the end was so abrupt that they had not had enough time to properly prepare for it they had been counting on four more years four years of glory as they carefully crafted a legacy then rode gallantly into the sunset though it was late it seemed to grow even darker outside the windows that overlooked the rose garden were black a clock above the fireplace could almost be heard as it ticked nonstop in its final countdown ldquowhat will the press do if i pardon backmanrdquo the president asked not for the first time ldquogo berserkrdquo ldquothat might be funrdquo ldquoyou wonrsquot be aroundrdquo ldquono i wonrsquotrdquo after the transfer of power at noon the next day his escape from washington would begin with a private jet owned by an oil company to an old friendrsquos villa on the island of barbados at morganrsquos instructions the televisions had been removed from the villa no newspapers or magazines would be delivered and all phones had been unplugged he would have no contact with anyone not even critz and especially not mrs morgan for at least a month he wouldnrsquot care if washington burned in fact he secretly hoped that it would after barbados he would sneak up to his cabin in alaska and there he would continue to ignore the world as the winter passed and he waited on spring ldquoshould we pardon himrdquo the president asked ldquoprobablyrdquo critz said the president had shifted to the ldquowerdquo mode now something he invariably did when a potentially unpopular decision was at hand for the easy ones it was always ldquoirdquo when he needed a crutch and especially when he would need someone to blame he opened up the decisionmaking process and included critz critz had been taking the blame for forty years and though he was certainly used to it he was nonetheless tired of it he said ldquotherersquos a very good chance we wouldnrsquot be here had it not been for joel backmanrdquo ldquoyou may be right about thatrdquo the president said he had always maintained that he had been elected because of his brilliant campaigning charismatic personality uncanny grasp of the issues and clear vision for america to finally admit that he owed anything to joel backman was almost shocking but critz was too calloused and too tired to be shocked six years ago the backman scandal had engulfed much of washington and eventually tainted the white house a cloud appeared over a popular president paving the way for arthur morgan to stumble his way into the white house now that he was stumbling out he relished the idea of one last arbitrary slap in the face to the washington establishment that had shunned him for four years a reprieve for joel backman would rattle the walls of every office building in dc and shock the press into a blathering frenzy morgan liked the idea while he sunned away on barbados the city would gridlock once again as congressmen demanded hearings and prosecutors performed for the cameras and the insufferable talking heads prattled nonstop on cable news the president smiled into the darkness on the arlington memorial bridge over the potomac river hoby refilled the directorrsquos paper cup with green tea ldquothank yourdquo teddy said softly ldquowhatrsquos our boy doing tomorrow when he leaves officerdquo he asked ldquofleeing the countryrdquo ldquohe shouldrsquove left soonerrdquo ldquohe plans to spend a month in the caribbean licking his wounds ignoring the world pouting waiting for someone to show some interestrdquo ldquoand mrs morganrdquo ldquoshersquos already back in delaware playing bridgerdquo ldquoare they splittingrdquo ldquoif hersquos smart who knowsrdquo teddy took a careful sip of tea ldquoso whatrsquos our leverage if morgan balksrdquo ldquoi donrsquot think hersquoll balk the preliminary talks have gone well critz seems to be on board he has a much better feel of things now than morgan critz knows that they wouldrsquove never seen the oval office had it not been for the backman scandalrdquo ldquoas i said whatrsquos our leverage if he balksrdquo ldquonone really hersquos an idiot but hersquos a clean onerdquo they turned off constitution avenue onto 18th street and were soon entering the east gate of the white house men with machine guns materialized from the darkness then secret service agents in black trench coats stopped the van code words were used radios squawked and within minutes teddy was being lowered from the van inside a cursory search of his wheelchair revealed nothing but a crippled and bundledup old man artie minus the heineken and again without knocking poked his head through the door and announced ldquomaynardrsquos hererdquo ldquoso hersquos aliverdquo the president said ldquobarelyrdquo ldquothen roll him inrdquo hoby and a deputy named priddy followed the wheelchair into the oval office the president and critz welcomed their guests and directed them to the sitting area in front of the fireplace though maynard avoided the white house priddy practically lived there briefing the president every morning on intelligence matters as they settled in teddy glanced around the room as if looking for bugs and listening devices he was almost certain there were none that practice had ended with watergatenbsp nixon laid enough wire in the white house to juice a small city but of course he paid for itnbsp teddy however was wired carefully hidden above the axle of his wheelchair just inches below his seat was a powerful recorder that would capture every sound made during the next thirty minutes he tried to smile at president morgan but he wanted to say something like you are without a doubt the most limited politician i have ever encountered only in america could a moron like you make it to the top president morgan smiled at teddy maynard but he wanted to say something like i should have fired you four years ago your agency has been a constant embarrassment to this country teddy i was shocked when you carried a single state albeit by seventeen votes morgan you couldnrsquot find a terrorist if he advertised on a billboard teddy happy fishing yoursquoll get even fewer trout than votes morgan why didnrsquot you just die like everyone promised me you would teddy presidents come and go but i never leave morgan it was critz who wanted to keep you thank him for your job i wanted to sack your ass two weeks after my inauguration critz said loudly ldquocoffee anyonerdquo teddy said ldquonordquo and as soon as that was established hoby and priddy likewise declined and because the cia wanted no coffee president morgan said ldquoyes black with two sugarsrdquo critz nodded at a secretary who was waiting in a halfopened side door he turned back to the gathering and said ldquowe donrsquot have a lot of timerdquo teddy said quickly ldquoirsquom here to discuss joel backmanrdquo ldquoyes thatrsquos why yoursquore hererdquo the president said ldquoas you knowrdquo teddy continued almost ignoring the president ldquomr backman went to prison without saying a word he still carries some secrets that frankly could compromise national securityrdquo ldquoyou canrsquot kill himrdquo critz blurted ldquowe cannot target american citizens mr critz itrsquos against the law we prefer that someone else do itrdquo ldquoi donrsquot followrdquo the president said ldquoherersquos the plan if you pardon mr backman and if he accepts the pardon then we will have him out of the country in a matter of hours he must agree to spend the rest of his life in hiding this should not be a problem because there are several people who would like to see him dead and he knows it wersquoll relocate him to a foreign country probably in europe where hersquoll be easier to watch hersquoll have a new identity hersquoll be a free man and with time people will forget about joel backmanrdquo ldquothatrsquos not the end of the storyrdquo critz said ldquono wersquoll wait perhaps a year or so then wersquoll leak the word in the right places theyrsquoll find mr backman and theyrsquoll kill him and when they do so many of our questions will be answeredrdquo a long pause as teddy looked at critz then the president when he was convinced they were thoroughly confused he continued ldquoitrsquos a very simple plan gentlemen itrsquos a question of who kills himrdquo ldquoso yoursquoll be watchingrdquo critz asked ldquovery closelyrdquo ldquowhorsquos after himrdquo the president asked teddy refolded his veiny hands and recoiled a bit then he looked down his long nose like a schoolteacher addressing his little third graders ldquoperhaps the russians the chinese maybe the israelis there could be othersrdquo of course there were others but no one expected teddy to reveal everything he knew he never had never would regardless of who was president and regardless of how much time he had left in the oval office they came and went some for four years others for eight some loved the espionage others were only concerned with the latest polls morgan had been particularly inept at foreign policy and with a few hours remaining in his administration teddy certainly was not going to divulge any more than was necessary to get the pardon ldquowhy would backman take such a dealrdquo critz asked ldquohe may notrdquo teddy answered ldquobut hersquos been in solitary confinement for six years thatrsquos twentythree hours a day in a tiny cell one hour of sunshine three showers a week bad foodmdashthey say hersquos lost sixty pounds i hear hersquos not doing too wellrdquo two months ago after the landslide when teddy maynard conceived this pardon scheme he had pulled a few of his many strings and backmanrsquos confinement had grown much worse the temperature in his cell was lowered ten degrees and for the past month hersquod had a terrible cough his food bland at best had been run through the processor again and was being served cold his toilet flushed about half the time the guards woke him up at all hours of the night his phone privileges were curtailed the law library that he used twice a week was suddenly offlimits backman a lawyer knew his rights and he was threatening all manner of litigation against the prison and the government though he had yet to file suit the fight was taking its toll he was demanding sleeping pills and prozac ldquoyou want me to pardon joel backman so you can arrange for him to be murderedrdquo the president asked ldquoyesrdquo teddy said bluntly ldquobut we wonrsquot actually arrange itrdquo ldquobut itrsquoll happenrdquo ldquoyesrdquo ldquoand his death will be in the best interests of our national securityrdquo ldquoi firmly believe thatrdquo
