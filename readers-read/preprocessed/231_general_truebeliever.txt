 one jeremy marsh sat with the rest of the live studio audience feeling unusually conspicuous he was one of only half a dozen men in attendance on that middecember afternoon he8217d dressed in black of course and with his dark wavy hair light blue eyes and fashionable stubble he looked every bit the new yorker that he was while studying the guest onstage he managed to surreptitiously watch the attractive blonde three rows up his profession often demanded effective multitasking he was an investigative journalist in pursuit of a story and the blonde was just another member of the audience still the professional observer in him couldn8217t help noticing how attractive she looked in her halter top and jeans journalistically speaking that is clearing his mind he tried to focus his attention on the guest again this guy was beyond ridiculous in the glare of television lights jeremy thought the spirit guide looked constipated as he claimed to hear voices from beyond the grave he had assumed a false intimacy acting as if he were everyone8217s brother or best friend and it seemed that the vast majority of the awestruck audience8212including the attractive blonde and the woman the guest was addressing8212considered him a gift from heaven itself which made sense jeremy thought since that was always where the lost loved ones ended up spirits from beyond the grave were always surrounded by bright angelic light and enveloped in an aura of peace and tranquillity never once had jeremy heard of a spirit guide channeling from the other hotter place a lost loved one never mentioned that he was being roasted on a spit or boiled in a cauldron of motor oil for instance but jeremy knew he was being cynical and besides he had to admit it was a pretty good show timothy clausen was good8212far better than most of the quacks jeremy had written about over the years 8220i know it8217s hard8221 clausen said into the microphone 8220but frank is telling you that it8217s time to let him go now8221 the woman he was addressing with ohsomuch empathy looked as if she was about to faint fiftyish she wore a greenstriped blouse her curly red hair sprouting and spiraling in every direction her hands were clasped so tightly at chest level that her fingers were white from the pressure clausen paused and brought his hand to his forehead drawing once more on 8220the world beyond8221 as he put it in the silence the crowd collectively leaned forward in their seats everyone knew what was coming next this was the third audience member clausen had chosen today not surprisingly clausen was the only featured guest on the popular talk show 8220do you remember the letter he sent you8221 clausen asked 8220before he died8221 the woman gasped the crewman beside her held the microphone even closer so that everyone watching on television would be able to hear her clearly 8220yes but how could you know about82128221 she stammered clausen didn8217t let her finish 8220do you remember what it said8221 he asked 8220yes8221 the woman croaked clausen nodded as if he8217d read the letter himself 8220it was about forgiveness wasn8217t it8221 on the couch the hostess of the show the most popular afternoon talk show in america swiveled her gaze from clausen to the woman and back again she looked both amazed and satisfied spirit guides were always good for ratings as the woman in the audience nodded jeremy noticed mascara beginning to stream down her cheeks the cameras zoomed in to show it more clearly daytime television at its dramatic best 8220but how could you 8221 the woman repeated 8220he was talking about your sister too8221 clausen murmured 8220not just himself8221 the woman stared at clausen transfixed 8220your sister ellen8221 clausen added and with that revelation the woman finally let loose a raspy cry tears burst forth like an automated sprinkler clausen8212tan and trim in his black suit with nary a hair out of place8212continued to nod like one of those bobbing dogs you stick on your dashboard the audience gazed at the woman in utter silence 8220frank left something else for you didn8217t he something from your past8221 in spite of the hot studio lights the woman actually seemed to pale in the corner of the set beyond the general viewing area jeremy saw the producer rotating an upraised finger in a helicopter pattern it was getting close to the commercial break clausen glanced almost imperceptibly in that direction no one but jeremy seemed to notice and he often wondered why viewers never questioned how channeling from the spirit world could be timed so perfectly to fit with commercial breaks clausen went on 8220that no one else could know about a key of some sort is that right8221 the sobs continued as the woman nodded 8220you never thought he8217d save it did you8221 okay here8217s the clincher jeremy thought another true believer on the way 8220it8217s from the hotel where you stayed on your honeymoon he put it there so that when you found it you would remember the happy times you spent together he doesn8217t want you to remember him with pain because he loves you8221 8220ooohhhhhhh 8221 the woman cried or something like that a moan perhaps from where he was sitting jeremy couldn8217t be certain because the cry was interrupted by sudden enthusiastic applause all at once the microphone was pulled away cameras zoomed out her moment in the sun completed the woman from the audience collapsed in her seat on cue the hostess stood from the couch and faced the camera 8220remember that what you8217re seeing is real none of these people have ever met with timothy clausen8221 she smiled 8220we8217ll be back with one more reading after this8221 more applause as the show broke for commercials and jeremy leaned back in his seat as an investigative journalist known for his interest in science he8217d made a career out of writing about people like this most of the time he enjoyed what he did and took pride in his work as a valuable public service in a profession so special as to have its rights enumerated in the first amendment of the constitution of the united states of america for his regular column in scientific american he8217d interviewed nobel laureates explained the theories of stephen hawking and einstein in lay terms and had once been credited with sparking the groundswell of public opinion that led the fda to remove a dangerous antidepressant from the market he8217d written extensively about the cassini project the faulty mirror on the lens of the hubble spacecraft and had been one of the first to publicly decry the utah cold fusion experiment as a fraud unfortunately as impressive as it sounded his column didn8217t pay much it was the freelance work that paid most of his bills and like all freelancers he was always hustling to come up with stories that would interest magazine or newspaper editors his niche had broadened to include 8220anything unusual8221 and in the past fifteen years he8217d researched and investigated psychics spirit guides faith healers and mediums he8217d exposed frauds hoaxes and forgeries he8217d visited haunted houses searched for mystical creatures and hunted for the origins of urban legends skeptical by nature he also had the rare ability to explain difficult scientific concepts in a way the average reader could understand and his articles had appeared in hundreds of newspapers and magazines around the world scientific debunking he felt was both noble and important even if the public didn8217t always appreciate it frequently the mail he received after publishing his freelance articles was peppered with words like 8220idiot8221 8220moron8221 and his personal favorite 8220government flunky8221 investigative journalism he8217d come to learn was a thankless business reflecting on this with a frown he observed the audience chatting eagerly wondering who would be chosen next jeremy stole another glance at the blonde who was examining her lipstick in a hand mirror jeremy already knew that the people chosen by clausen weren8217t officially part of the act even though clausen8217s appearance was announced in advance and people had fought wildly for tickets to the show which meant of course that the audience was loaded with lifeafterdeath believers to them clausen was legitimate how else could he know such personal things about strangers unless he talked to spirits but like any good magician who had his repertoire down pat the illusion was still an illusion and right before the show jeremy not only had figured out how he was pulling it off but had the photographic evidence to prove it bringing down clausen would be jeremy8217s biggest coup to date and it served the guy right clausen was the worst kind of con man and yet the pragmatic side of jeremy also realized that this was the kind of story that rarely came along and he wanted to make the most of it clausen after all was on the cusp of enormous celebrity and in america celebrity was all that mattered though he knew the odds were utterly improbable he fantasized about what would happen if clausen actually picked him next he didn8217t expect it being chosen was akin to winning the trifecta at santa anita and even if it didn8217t happen jeremy knew he8217d still have a quality story but quality and extraordinary were often separated by simple twists of fate and as the commercial break ended he felt the slightest twinge of unjustified hope that somehow clausen would zero in on him and as if god himself wasn8217t exactly thrilled with what clausen was doing either that was exactly what happened three weeks later winter in manhattan was bearing down hard a front from canada had moved in dropping temperatures to nearly zero and plumes of steam rose steadily from the sewer grates before settling over the icy sidewalks not that anyone seemed to mind new york8217s hardy citizens displayed their usual indifference to all things weatherrelated and friday nights were not to be wasted under any circumstance people worked too hard during the week to waste an evening out especially when there was reason to celebrate nate johnson and alvin bernstein had already been celebrating for an hour as had a couple of dozen friends and journalists8212some from scientific american 8212who8217d assembled in jeremy8217s honor most were well into the buzz phase of the evening and enjoying themselves immensely mostly because journalists tended to be budgetconscious and nate was picking up the tab nate was jeremy8217s agent alvin a freelance cameraman was jeremy8217s best friend and they8217d gathered at the trendy bar on the upper west side to celebrate jeremy8217s appearance on abc8217s primetime live commercials for primetime live had been airing that week8212most of them featuring jeremy front and center and the promise of a major exposeacute8212and interview requests were pouring into nate8217s office from around the country earlier that afternoon people magazine had called and an interview was scheduled for the following monday morning there hadn8217t been enough time to organize a private room for the gettogether but no one seemed to mind with its long granite bar and dramatic lighting the packed facility was yuppieville while the journalists from scientific american tended to wear tweed sport jackets with pocket protectors and were crowded into one corner of the room discussing photons most of the other patrons looked as if they8217d dropped by after finishing up at work on wall street or madison avenue italian suit jackets slung over the backs of chairs hermegraves ties loosened men who seemed to want to do nothing more than to scope out the women in attendance while flashing their rolexes women straight from work in publishing and advertising were dressed in designer skirts and impossibly high heels sipping flavored martinis while pretending to ignore the men jeremy himself had his eye on a tall redhead standing at the other end of the bar who appeared to be glancing his way he wondered if she recognized him from the television ads or whether she just wanted some company she turned away apparently uninterested but then looked his way again with her gaze lingering just a little longer this time jeremy raised his glass 8220c8217mon jeremy pay attention8221 nate said nudging him with his elbow 8220you8217re on tv don8217t you want to see how you did8221 jeremy turned from the redhead glancing up at the screen he saw himself sitting opposite diane sawyer strange he thought like being in two places at once it still didn8217t seem quite real nothing in the past three weeks had seemed real despite his years in media onscreen diane was describing him as 8220america8217s most esteemed scientific journalist8221 not only had the story turned out to be everything he8217d wanted but nate was even talking to primetime live about jeremy doing regular stories for them with a possibility of additional features on good morning america though many journalists believed television was less important than other more serious forms of reporting it didn8217t stop most of them from secretly viewing television as the holy grail by which they meant big money despite the congratulations envy was in the air a sensation as foreign to jeremy as space travel after all journalists of his stripe weren8217t exactly at the top of the media pecking order8212until today 8220did she just call you esteemed8221 alvin asked 8220you write about bigfoot and the legend of atlantis8221 8220shh8221 nate said his eyes glued to the television 8220i8217m trying to hear this it could be important for jeremy8217s career8221 as jeremy8217s agent nate was forever promoting events that 8220could be important for jeremy8217s career8221 for the simple reason that freelancing wasn8217t all that lucrative years earlier when nate was starting out jeremy had pitched a book proposal and they8217d been working together ever since simply because they8217d become friends 8220whatever8221 alvin said dismissing the scolding meanwhile flickering on the screen behind diane sawyer and jeremy were the final moments of jeremy8217s performance on the daytime television show in which jeremy had pretended to be a man grieving the boyhood death of his brother a boy clausen claimed to be channeling for jeremy8217s benefit 8220he8217s with me8221 clausen could be heard announcing 8220he wants you to let him go thad8221 the picture shifted to capture jeremy8217s rendition of an anguished guest his face contorted clausen nodded in the background either oozing sympathy or looking constipated depending on the perspective 8220your mother never changed his room8212the room you shared with him she insisted that it be kept unchanged and you still had to sleep there8221 clausen went on 8220yes8221 jeremy gasped 8220but you were frightened in there and in your anger you took something of his something very personal and buried it in the backyard8221 8220yes8221 jeremy managed again as if too emotional to say more 8220his retainer8221 8220ooooohhhhhhhhh8221 jeremy cried bringing his hands to his face 8220he loves you but you have to realize that he8217s at peace now he has no anger toward you 8221 8220ooooohhhhhhh8221 jeremy wailed again contorting his face even more in the bar nate watched the clips in silent concentration alvin on the other hand was laughing as he raised his beer high 8220give that man an oscar8221 he shouted 8220it was rather impressive wasn8217t it8221 jeremy said grinning 8220i mean it you two8221 nate said not hiding his irritation 8220talk during the commercials8221 8220whatever8221 alvin said again 8220whatever8221 had always been alvin8217s favorite word on primetime live the videotape faded to black and the camera focused on diane sawyer and jeremy sitting across from each other once again 8220so nothing timothy clausen said was true8221 diane asked 8220not a thing8221 jeremy said 8220as you already know my name isn8217t thad and while i do have five brothers they8217re all alive and well8221 diane held a pen over a pad of paper as if she was about to take notes 8220so how did clausen do this8221 8220well diane8221 jeremy began in the bar alvin8217s pierced eyebrow rose he leaned toward jeremy 8220did you just call her diane like you8217re friends 8221 8220could you please8221 nate said growing more exasperated by the moment onscreen jeremy was going on 8220what clausen does is simply a variation on what people have been doing for hundreds of years first of all he8217s good at reading people and he8217s an expert at making vague emotionally charged associations and responding to audience members8217 cues8221 8220yes but he was so specific not only with you but with the other guests he had names how does he do that8221 jeremy shrugged 8220he heard me talking about my brother marcus before the show i simply made up an imaginary life and broadcast it loud and clear8221 8220how did it actually reach clausen8217s ears8221 8220con men like clausen have been known to use a variety of tricks including microphones and paid 8216listeners8217 who circulate in the waiting area before the show before i was seated i made sure to move around and strike up conversations with lots of audience members watching to see if anyone exhibited unusual interest in my story and sure enough one man seemed particularly concerned8221 behind them the videotape was replaced by an enlarged photograph that jeremy had taken with a small camera hidden in his watch a hightech spy toy he8217d promptly expensed to scientific american jeremy loved hightech toys almost as much as he loved expensing them to others 8220what are we looking at here8221 diane asked jeremy pointed 8220this man was mingling with the studio audience posing as a visitor from peoria i took this photograph right before the show while we were talking zoom in further please8221 onscreen the photograph was enlarged and jeremy motioned toward it 8220do you see the small usa pin on his lapel that8217s not just for decoration it8217s actually a miniature transmitter that broadcasts to a recording device backstage8221 diane frowned 8220how do you know this8221 8220because8221 jeremy said raising an eyebrow 8220i happen to have one just like it8221 on cue jeremy reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out what appeared to be the same usa pin attached to a long threadlike wire and transmitter 8220this particular model is manufactured in israel82218212jeremy8217s voice could be heard over the camera closeup of the gadget82128220and it8217s very highend i8217ve heard it8217s used by the cia but of course i can8217t confirm that what i can tell you is that the technology is very advanced8212this little microphone can pick up conversations from across a noisy crowded room and with the right filtering systems can even isolate them8221 diane inspected the pin with apparent fascination 8220and you8217re certain that this was indeed a microphone and not just a pin8221 8220well as you know i8217ve been looking into clausen8217s past for a long time now and a week after the show i managed to obtain some more photographs8221 a new photograph flashed on the screen though a bit grainy it was a picture of the same man who8217d been wearing the usa pin 8220this photo was taken in florida outside clausen8217s office as you can see the man is heading inside his name is rex moore and he8217s actually an employee of clausen8217s he8217s worked with clausen for two years8221 8220ooohhhhh8221 alvin shouted and the rest of the broadcast which was winding down anyway was drowned out as others jealous or not joined in with hoots and hollers the free booze had worked its magic and jeremy was deluged with congratulations after the show had ended 8220you were fantastic8221 nate said at fortythree nate was short and balding and had a tendency to wear suits that were just a bit too tight in the waist no matter the man was energy incarnate and like most agents positively buzzed with fervent optimism 8220thanks8221 jeremy said downing the remainder of his beer 8220this is going to be big for your career8221 nate went on 8220it8217s your ticket to a regular television gig no more scrambling for lousy freelance magazine work no more chasing ufo stories i8217ve always said that with your looks you were made for tv8221 8220you have always said that8221 jeremy conceded with the eyerolling manner of someone reciting an oftgiven lecture 8220i mean it the producers from primetime live and gma keep calling talking about using you as a regular contributor on their shows you know 8216what this latebreaking science news means for you8217 and all that a big leap for a science reporter8221 8220i8217m a journalist8221 jeremy sniffed 8220not a reporter8221 8220whatever8221 nate said making a motion as if brushing away a fly 8220like i8217ve always said your looks are made for television8221 8220i8217d have to say nate8217s right8221 alvin added with a wink 8220i mean how else could you be more popular than me with the ladies despite having zero personality8221 for years alvin and jeremy had frequented bars together trolling for dates jeremy laughed alvin bernstein whose name conjured up a cleancut bespectacled accountant8212one of the countless professionals who wore florsheim shoes and carried a briefcase to work8212didn8217t look like an alvin bernstein as a teenager he8217d seen eddie murphy in delirious and had decided to make the fullleather style his own a wardrobe that horrified his florsheimwearing briefcasecarrying father melvin fortunately leather seemed to go well with his tattoos alvin considered tattoos to be a reflection of his unique aesthetic and he was uniquely aesthetic on both his arms right up to his shoulder blades all of which complemented alvin8217s multiply pierced ears 8220so are you still planning a trip down south to investigate that ghost story8221 nate pressed jeremy could fairly see the wheels clicking and clacking away in his brain 8220after your interview with people i mean8221 jeremy brushed his dark hair out of his eyes and signaled the bartender for another beer 8220yeah i guess so primetime or no primetime i still have bills to pay and i was thinking i could use this for my column8221 8220but you8217ll be in contact right not like when you went undercover with the righteous and holy8221 he was referring to a sixthousandword piece jeremy had done for vanity fair about a religious cult in that instance jeremy had essentially severed all communication for a period of three months 8220i8217ll be in contact8221 jeremy said 8220this story isn8217t like that i should be out of there in less than a week 8216mysterious lights in the cemetery8217 no big deal8221 8220hey you need a cameraman by any chance8221 alvin piped in jeremy looked over at him 8220why do you want to go8221 8220hell yeah head south for the winter maybe meet me a nice southern belle while you pick up the tab i hear the women down there will drive you crazy but in a good way it8217ll be like an exotic vacation8221 8220aren8217t you supposed to be shooting something for law amp order next week8221 as strange as alvin looked his reputation was impeccable and his services were usually in high demand 8220yeah but i8217ll be clear toward the end of the week8221 alvin said 8220and look if you8217re serious about this television thing like nate says you should be it might be important to get some decent footage of these mysterious lights8221 8220that8217s assuming there are even any lights to film8221 8220you do the advance work and let me know i8217ll keep my calendar open8221 8220even if there are lights it8217s a small story8221 jeremy warned 8220no one in television will be interested in it8221 8220not last month maybe8221 alvin said 8220but after seeing you tonight they8217ll be interested you know how it is in television8212all those producers chasing their own tails trying to find the next big thing if gma is suddenly hot to trot then you know the today show will be calling soon and dateline will be knocking at the door no producer wants to be left out that8217s how they get fired the last thing they want to do is to have to explain to the executives why they missed the boat believe me8212i work in television i know these people8221 8220he8217s right8221 nate said interrupting them 8220you never know what8217ll happen next and it might be a good idea to plan ahead you had definite presence tonight don8217t kid yourself and if you can get some actual footage of the lights it might be just the thing that gma or primetime needs to make their decision8221 jeremy squinted at his agent 8220you serious about this it8217s a nothing story the reason i decided to do it at all was because i needed a break after clausen that story took four months of my life8221 8220and look what it got you8221 nate said putting a hand on jeremy8217s shoulder 8220this may be a fluff piece but with sensational footage and a good backstory who knows what television will think8221 jeremy was silent for a moment before finally shrugging 8220fine8221 he said he glanced at alvin 8220i8217m leaving on tuesday see if you can get there by next friday i8217ll call you before then with the details8221 alvin reached for his beer and took a drink 8220well golly8221 he said mimicking gomer pyle 8220i8217m off to the land of grits and chitlins and i promise my bill won8217t be too high8221 jeremy laughed 8220you ever been down south8221 8220nope you8221 8220i8217ve visited new orleans and atlanta8221 jeremy admitted 8220but those are cities and cities are pretty much the same everywhere for this story we8217re heading to the real south it8217s a little town in north carolina a place called boone creek you should see the town8217s web site it talks about the azaleas and dogwoods that bloom in april and proudly displays a picture of the town8217s most prominent citizen a guy named norwood jefferson8221 8220who8221 alvin asked 8220a politician he served in the north carolina state senate from 1907 to 19168221 8220who cares8221 8220exactly8221 jeremy said with a nod glancing across the bar he noticed with disappointment that the redhead was gone 8220where is this place exactly8221 8220right between the middle of nowhere and 8216where are we exactly8217 i8217m staying at a place called greenleaf cottages which the chamber of commerce describes as scenic and rustic yet modern whatever that means8221 alvin laughed 8220sounds like an adventure8221 8220don8217t worry about it you8217ll fit right in down there i8217m sure8221 8220you think so8221 jeremy noted the leather tattoos and piercings 8220oh absolutely8221 jeremy said 8220they8217ll probably want to adopt you8221
