farting but there were some downsides the relative absence of breakfast was the first and most notable difference to my daily timetable inside books dinners are often written about and therefore feature frequently as do lunches and afternoon tea probably because they offer more opportunities to further the story breakfast wasnrsquot all that was missing there was a peculiar lack of cinemas wallpaper toilets colors books animals underwear smells haircuts and strangely enough minor illnesses if some one was ill in a book it was either terminal and dramatically un pleasant or a mild head cold151there wasnrsquot much in between i was able to take up residence inside fiction by virtue of a scheme entitled the character exchange program due to a spate of bored and disgruntled bookpeople escaping from their novels and becoming what we called pagerunners the authorities set up the scheme to allow characters a change of scenery in any year there are close to ten thousand exchanges few of which result in any major plot or dialogue infringements151the reader rarely suspects anything at all since i was from the real world and not actually a character at all the bellman and miss havisham had agreed to let me live inside the bookworld in ex change for helping out at junsfiction151at least as long as my pregnancy would allow the choice of book for my selfenforced exile had not been a bitrary when miss havisham asked me in which novel i would care to reside i had thought long and hard robinson crusoe would have been ideal considering the climate but there was no one female to exchange with i could have gone to pride and prejudice but i wasnrsquot wild about high collars bonnets corsets151 and delicate manners no to avoid any complications and reduce the possibility of having to move i had decided to make my home in a book of such dubious and uneven quality that publication and my subsequent enforced ejection was unlikely in the extreme i found just such a book deep within the well of lost plots amongst failed attempts at prose and halffinished epics of such dazzling ineptness that they would never see the light of day the book was a dreary crime thriller set in reading entitled caversham heights i had planned to stay there for only a year but it didnrsquot work out that way plans with me are like de floss novels151try as you might you never know quite how they are going to turn out i read my way into cavers ham heights the air felt warm after the wintry conditions back home and i found myself standing on a wooden jetty at the edge of a lake in front of me there was a large and seemingly derelict flying boat of the sort that still plied the coastal routes back home i had flown on one myself not six months before on the trail of someone claiming to have found some unpublished burns poetry but that was another lifetime ago when i was specops in swindon the world i had temporarily left behind the ancient flying boat rocked gently in the breeze

about a year so longrdquo she turned to the cabbie muttered ldquoget me out of this bookrdquo and she and the car faded out leaving me alone on the dusty track i sat upon a rickety wooden seat next to a tub of longdead flowers and let pickwick out of her bag she ruffled her feathers indignantly and blinked in the sunlight i looked across the lake at the sailing dinghies that were little more than brightly colored triangles that tacked backwards and forwards in the distance nearer to shore a pair of swans beat their wings furiously and pedaled the water in an attempt to take off landing almost as soon as they were airborne throwing up a long streak of spray on the calm waters it seemed a lot of effort to go a few hundred yards i turned my attention to the flying boat the layers of paint that covered and protected the riveted hull had partly peeled off to reveal the colorful livery of longforgotten airlines beneath the perspex windows had clouded with age and high in the massive wing untidy cables hung lazily from the oilstained cowlings of the three empty engine bays their safe inaccessibility now a haven for nesting birds goliath aornis and specops seemed a million miles away151but then so did landen landen memories of my husband were never far away i thought of all the times we had spent together that hadnrsquot actually happened all the places we hadnrsquot visited all the things we hadnrsquot done he might have been eradicated at the age of two but i still had our memories151 just no one to share them with i was interrupted from my thoughts by the sound of a motor cycle approaching the rider didnrsquot have much control of the vehicle i was glad that he stopped short of the jetty151his erratic riding might well have led him straight into the lake ldquohullordquo he said cheerfully removing his helmet to reveal a youngish man with a dark mediterranean complexion and deep sunken eyes ldquomy namersquos arnold i havenrsquot seen you around here before have irdquo i got up and shook his hand ldquothe namersquos next thursday next character exchange programrdquo ldquooh blastrdquo he muttered ldquoblast and double blast i suppose that means

ldquoshe didrdquo replied arnold brightening up ldquothatrsquos a good sign normally she calls me a loser and tells me to go rot in hellrdquo ldquoshe probably wonrsquot be back for a whilerdquo i added trying to make up for not passing on maryrsquos message properly ldquomaybe a year151maybe morerdquo ldquoi seerdquo he murmured sighing deeply and staring off across the lake he caught sight of pickwick who was attempting to outstare a strange aquatic bird with a rounded bill ldquowhatrsquos thatrdquo he asked suddenly ldquoi think itrsquos a duck although i canrsquot be sure151we donrsquot have any where i come fromrdquo ldquono the other thingrdquo ldquoa dodordquo l ldquowhatrsquos the matterrdquo asked arnold i was getting a footnoterphone signal in the book world people generally

ldquoohrdquo said arnold looking pale all of a sudden he bit his lip and gave such an imploring look that i almost laughed ldquodonrsquot sweatrdquo i told him ldquoi wonrsquot report itrdquo he sighed a deep sigh of relief muttered his thanks re mounted his motorbike and drove off in a jerky fashion narrowly missing the mailboxes at the top of the track the interior of the flying boat was lighter and more airy than i had imagined but it smelt a bit musty mary was mistaken she had not been halfway through the craftrsquos conversion151it was more like onetenth the walls were halfpaneled with pine tongue andgroove and rockwool insulation stuck out untidily along with unused electrical cables there was room for two floors within the boatrsquos cavernous hull the downstairs a large openplan living room with a couple of old sofas pointing towards a television set i tried to switch it on but it was dead151there was no tv in the bookworld unless called for in the narrative much of what i could see around me were merely props necessary for the chapter in which jack spratt visits the sunderland to discuss the case on the mantelpiece above a small woodburning stove were pictures of mary from her days at the police training college and another from when she was promoted to detective sergeant i opened a door that led into a small kitchenette attached to the fridge was the preacutecis of caversham heights i flicked through it the sequence of events was pretty much as i remembered from my first reading in the well although it seemed that mary had overstated her role in some of the puzzlesolving areas i put the preacutecis down found a bowl and filled it with water for pickwick took her egg from my bag and laid it on the sofa where she quickly set about turning it over and tapping it gently with her beak i went forward and discovered a bedroom where the nose turret would have been and climbed a narrow aluminum ladder to the flight deck directly above this was the best view in the house the large greenhouselike perspex windows affording a good view of the lake the massive control wheels were set in front of two comfortable chairs and facing them and ahead of a tangled mass of engine control levers was a complex panel of broken and faded instruments to my right i could see the one remaining engine looking forlorn the propeller blades streaked with bird droppings behind the pilotsrsquo seats where the flight engineer would have sat there was a desk with reading lamp footnoterphone and typewriter on the bookshelf were mainly magazines of a police nature and lots of forensic textbooks i walked through a narrow doorway and found a pleasant bedroom the headroom was not overgenerous but it was cozy and dry and was paneled in pine with a porthole above the double bed behind the bedroom was a storeroom a hotwater boiler stacks of wood and a spiral staircase i was just about to go downstairs when i heard someone speak from the living room below ldquowhat do you think that isrdquo the voice had an empty ring to it and was neuter in its inflection151i couldnrsquot tell if it was male or female i stopped and instinctively pulled my automatic from my shoulder holster mary lived alone151or so it had said in the book as i moved slowly downstairs i heard another voice answer the first ldquoi think itrsquos a bird of some sortrdquo the second voice was no more distinctive than the first and indeed if the second voice had not been answering the first i might have thought they belonged to the same person as i rounded the staircase i saw two figures standing in the middle of the room staring at pickwick who stared back courageously protecting her egg from behind the sofa ldquoheyrdquo i said pointing my gun in their direction ldquohold it right thererdquo the two figures looked up and stared at me without expression from features that were as insipid and muted as their voices because of their equal blandness it was impossible to tell them apart their arms hung limply by their sides exhibiting no body language they might have been angry or curious or worried or elated151but i couldnrsquot tell ldquowho are yourdquo i asked ldquowe are nobodyrdquo replied the one on the left ldquoeveryone is someonerdquo i replied ldquonot altogether correctrdquo said the one on the right ldquowe have a code number but nothing more i am tsi1404912a and this is tsi1404912crdquo ldquowhat happened to brdquo ldquotaken by a grammasite last tuesdayrdquo i lowered my gun miss havisham had told me about generics they were created here in the well to populate the books that were to be written at the point of creation they were simply a human canvas without paint151blank like a coin ready to be stamped with individualism they had no history no conflicts no foibles151nothing that might make them either readable or interesting in any way it was up to various institutions to teach them to be useful members of fiction they were graded too a to d one through ten any that were dgraded were like worker bees in crowds and busy streets small speaking parts were cgrades bgrades usually made up the bulk of featured but not leading characters these parts usually151but not always151went to the agrades handpicked for their skills at character projection and multidimensionality huckleberry finn tess and anna karenina were all agrades but then so were mr hyde hannibal lecter and professor moriarty i looked at the ungraded generics again murderers or heroes it was impossible to tell how they would turn out still at this stage of their development they would be harmless i reholstered my automatic ldquoyoursquore generics rightrdquo ldquoindeedrdquo they said in unison ldquowhat are you doing hererdquo ldquoyou remember the craze for minimalismrdquo asked the one on the right ldquoyesrdquo i replied moving closer to stare at their blank faces curiously there was a lot about the well that i was going to have to get used to they were harmless enough151but decidedly creepy pickwick was still hiding behind the sofa ldquoit was caused by the 1982 character shortagerdquo said the one on the left ldquovikram seth is planning a large book in the next few years and i donrsquot think the well wants to be caught out again151 wersquore being manufactured and then sent to stay in unpublished novels until we are called into servicerdquo ldquosort of stockpiled you meanrdquo ldquoirsquod prefer the word billetedrdquo replied the one on the left the slight indignation indicating that it wouldnrsquot be without a personality forever ldquohow long have you been hererdquo ldquoso do irdquo added the one on the left ldquolikewiserdquo i paused for a moment ldquo0151kay since we all have to live together i had better give you names yourdquo i said pointing a finger at the one on the right ldquoare henceforth called ibb yourdquo151i pointed to the other151rdquoare called obbrdquo i pointed at them again in case they had missed it as neither made any sign of comprehending what irsquod said151or even hearing it ldquoyou are ibb and you are obbrdquo i paused something didnrsquot sound right about their names but i couldnrsquot place it ldquoibbrdquo i said to myself then ldquoobb ibb ibbobb does that sound strange to yourdquo ldquono capitalsrdquo said obb ldquowe donrsquot get capitalized until we start school151we didnrsquot expect a name so soon either can we keep itrdquo ldquoitrsquos a gift from merdquo i told them ldquoi am ibbrdquo said ibb as if to make the point ldquoand i am obbrdquo said obb ldquoand irsquom thursdayrdquo i told them offering my hand they shook it in turn slowly and without emotion i could see that this pair werenrsquot going to be a huge bundle of fun ldquoand thatrsquos pickwickrdquo they looked at pickwick who plocked quietly came out from behind the sofa settled herself on her egg and pretended to go to sleep ldquowellrdquo i announced clapping my hands together ldquodoes anyone know how to cook irsquom not very good at it and if you donrsquot want to eat beans on toast for the next year you had better start to learn irsquom standing in for mary and if you donrsquot get in my way i wonrsquot get in yours i go to bed late and wake up early i have a husband who doesnrsquot exist and irsquom going to have a baby later this year so might get a little cranky151and overweight any questionsrdquo ldquoyesrdquo said the one on the left ldquowhich one of us is obb did you sayrdquo i unpacked my few things in the small room behind the flight deck i had sketched a picture of landen from memory and i placed it on the bedside table staring at it for a moment i missed him dreadfully and wondered for the umpteenth time whether perhaps 1 shouldnrsquot be here hiding but out there in my own world trying to get him back trouble was irsquod tried that and made a complete pigrsquos ear of it151if it hadnrsquot have been for miss havishamrsquos timely rescue i would still be locked up in a goliath vault somewhere with our child growing within me i had decided that flight was not a cowardrsquos option but a sensible one151i would stay here until the baby was born i could then plan my return and following that landenrsquos i went downstairs and explained to obb the rudiments of cooking which were as alien to it as having a name fortunately i found an old copy of mrs beetonrsquos complete housekeeper which i told obb to study halfjokingly as research three hours later it had roasted a perfect leg of iamb with all the trimmings i had discovered

over and tapping it gently with her beak i went forward and discovered a bedroom where the nose turret would have been and climbed a narrow aluminum ladder to the flight deck directly above this was the best view in the house the large greenhouselike perspex windows affording a good view of the lake the massive control wheels were set in front of two comfortable chairs and facing them and ahead of a tangled mass of engine control levers was a complex panel of broken and faded instruments to my right i could see the one remaining engine looking forlorn the propeller blades streaked with bird droppings behind the pilotsrsquo seats where the flight engineer would have sat there was a desk with reading lamp footnoterphone and typewriter on the bookshelf were mainly magazines of a police nature and lots of forensic textbooks i walked through a narrow doorway and found a pleasant bedroom the headroom was not overgenerous but it was cozy and dry and was paneled in pine with a porthole above the double bed behind the bedroom was a storeroom a hotwater boiler stacks of wood and a spiral staircase i was just about to go downstairs when i heard someone speak from the living room below ldquowhat do you think that isrdquo the voice had an empty ring to it and was neuter in its inflection151i couldnrsquot tell if it was male or female i stopped and instinctively pulled my automatic from my shoulder holster mary lived alone151or so it had said in the book as i moved slowly downstairs i heard another voice answer the first ldquoi think itrsquos a bird of some sortrdquo the second voice was no more distinctive than the first and indeed if the second voice had not been answering the first i might have thought they belonged to the same person as i rounded the staircase i saw two figures standing in the middle of the room staring at pickwick who stared back courageously protecting her egg from behind the sofa ldquoheyrdquo i said pointing my gun in their direction ldquohold it right thererdquo the two figures looked up and stared at me without expression from features that were as insipid and muted as their voices because of their equal blandness it was impossible to tell

agrades but then so were mr hyde hannibal lecter and professor moriarty i looked at the ungraded generics again murderers or heroes it was impossible to tell how they would turn out still at this stage of their development they would be harmless i reholstered my automatic ldquoyoursquore generics rightrdquo ldquoindeedrdquo they said in unison ldquowhat are you doing hererdquo ldquoyou remember the craze for minimalismrdquo asked the one on the right ldquoyesrdquo i replied moving closer to stare at their blank faces curiously there was a lot about the well that i was going to have to get used to they were harmless enough151but decidedly creepy pickwick was still hiding behind the sofa ldquoit was caused by the 1982 character shortagerdquo said the one on the left ldquovikram

sketched a picture of landen from memory and i placed it on the bedside table staring at it for a moment i missed him dreadfully and wondered for the umpteenth time whether perhaps 1 shouldnrsquot be here hiding but out there in my own world trying to get him back trouble was irsquod tried that and made a complete pigrsquos ear of it151if it hadnrsquot have been for miss havishamrsquos timely rescue i would still be locked up in a goliath vault somewhere with our child growing within me i had decided that flight was not a cowardrsquos option but a sensible one151i would stay here until the baby was born i could then plan my return and following that landenrsquos i went downstairs and explained to obb the rudiments of cooking which were as alien to it as having a name fortunately i found an old copy of mrs beetonrsquos complete housekeeper which i told obb to study halfjokingly as research three hours later it had roasted a perfect leg of iamb with all the trimmings i had discovered

great library the library is where all published fiction is stored so it can be read by the readers in the outland there are twentysix floors one for each letter of the alphabet the library is constructed in the layout of a cross with the four corridors radiating from the center point on all the walls end after end shelf after shelf are books hundreds thousands millions of books hardbacks paperbacks leatherbound everything but the similarity of all these books to the copies we read back home is no more than the similarity a photograph has to its subject these books are alive beneath the great library are twentysix floors of dingy yet industrious subbasements known as the well of lost plots this is where books are constructed honed and polished in readiness for a place in the library above151if they make it that far the failure rate is high unpublished books outnumber published by an estimated eight to one thursday next the jurisfiction chronicles making onersquos home in an unpublished novel wasnrsquot without its compensations all the boring daytoday mundanities that we conduct in the real world get in the way of narrative flow and are thus generally avoided the car didnrsquot need refueling there were never any wrong numbers there was always enough hot water and vacuum cleaner bags came in only two sizes151 upright and pull along there were other more subtle differences too for instance no one ever needed to repeat themselves in case you didnrsquot hear no one shared the same name talked at the same time or had a word annoyingly ldquoon the tip of their tonguerdquo best of all the bad guy was always someone you knew of and151 chaucer aside151there wasnrsquot much farting but there were some downsides the relative absence of breakfast was the first and most notable difference to my daily timetable inside books dinners are often written about and therefore feature frequently as do lunches and afternoon tea probably because they offer more opportunities to further the story breakfast wasnrsquot all that was missing there was a peculiar lack of cinemas wallpaper toilets colors books animals underwear smells haircuts and strangely enough minor illnesses if some one was ill in a book it was either terminal and dramatically un pleasant or a mild head cold151there wasnrsquot much in between i was able to take up residence inside fiction by virtue of a scheme entitled the character exchange program due to a spate of bored and disgruntled bookpeople escaping from their novels and becoming what we called pagerunners the authorities set up the scheme to allow characters a change of scenery in any year there are close to ten thousand exchanges few of which result in any major plot or dialogue infringements151the reader rarely suspects anything at all since i was from the real world and not actually a character at all the bellman and miss havisham had agreed to let me live inside the bookworld in ex change for helping out at junsfiction151at least as long as my pregnancy would allow the choice of book for my selfenforced exile had not been a bitrary when miss havisham asked me in which novel i would care to reside i had thought long and hard robinson crusoe would have been ideal considering the climate but there was no one female to exchange with i could have gone to pride and prejudice but i wasnrsquot wild about high collars bonnets corsets151 and delicate manners no to avoid any complications and reduce the possibility of having to move i had decided to make my home in a book of such dubious and uneven quality that publication and my subsequent enforced ejection was unlikely in the extreme i found just such a book deep within the well of lost plots amongst failed attempts at prose and halffinished epics of such dazzling ineptness that they would never see the light of day the book was a dreary crime thriller set in reading entitled caversham heights i had planned to stay there for only a year but it didnrsquot work out that way plans with me are like de floss novels151try as you might you never know quite how they are going to turn out i read my way into cavers ham heights the air felt warm after the wintry conditions back home and i found myself standing on a wooden jetty at the edge of a lake in front of me there was a large and seemingly derelict flying boat of the sort that still plied the coastal routes back home i had flown on one myself not six months before on the trail of someone claiming to have found some unpublished burns poetry but that was another lifetime ago when i was specops in swindon the world i had temporarily left behind the ancient flying boat rocked gently in the breeze tautening the mooring ropes and creaking gently the water gently slapping against the hull as i watched the old aircraft wondering just how long something this decrepit could stay afloat a welldressed young woman stepped out of an ovalshaped door in the high sided hull she was carrying a suitcase i had read the novel of caversham heights so i knew mary well although she didnrsquot know me ldquohullordquo she shouted trotting up and offering me a hand ldquoirsquom mary you must be thursday my goodness whatrsquos thatrdquo ldquoa dodo her namersquos pickwickrdquo pickwick plocked and stared at mary suspiciously ldquoreallyrdquo she replied looking at the bird curiously ldquoirsquom no expert of course but151i thought dodos were extinctrdquo ldquowhere i come from theyrsquore a bit of a pestrdquo ldquoohrdquo mused mary ldquoirsquom not sure irsquove heard

inquisitively with a slender index finger as though i might be made of glass ldquoirsquove never seen someone from the other side beforerdquo she announced clearly relieved to find that i wasnrsquot going to shatter into a thousand pieces ldquotell me is it true you have to cut your hair on a regular basis i mean your hair actually growsrdquo ldquoyesrdquo151i smiled151rdquoand my fingernails toordquo ldquoreallyrdquo mused mary ldquoirsquove heard rumors about that but i thought it was just one of those outlandish legends i suppose you have to eat too to stay alive i mean not just when the story calls for itrdquo ldquoone of the great pleasures of liferdquo i assured her i didnrsquot think irsquod tell her about realworld downsides such as tooth decay incontinence or old age mary lived in a threeyear window and neither aged died married had children got sick or changed in any way although appearing resolute and strong minded she was only like this because she was written that way for all her qualities mary was simply a foil to jack spratt the detective in caversham heights the loyal sergeant figure to whom jack explained things so the readers knew what was going on she was what writers called an expositional but irsquod never be as impolite to say so to her face ldquois this where irsquom going to liverdquo i was pointing at the shabby flying boat ldquoi know what yoursquore thinkingrdquo mary smiled proudly ldquoisnrsquot she just the most beautiful thing ever shersquos a sunderland built in 1943 but last flew in lsquo68 irsquom midway converting her to a houseboat but donrsquot feel shy if you want to help out just keep the bilges pumped out and if you can run the number three engine once a month irsquod be very grateful151the startup checklist is on the flight deck ldquowell151okayrdquo i muttered ldquogood irsquove left a preacutecis of the story taped to the fridge and a rough idea of what you have to say but donrsquot worry about being word perfect since wersquore not published you can say almost any thing you want151within reason of courserdquo ldquoof courserdquo i thought for a moment ldquoirsquom new to the character exchange program when will i be called to do somethingrdquo ldquowyatt is the inbook exchange liaison officer hersquoll let you know jack might seem gruff to begin withrdquo continued mary ldquobut he has a heart of gold if he asks you to drive his austin allegro make sure you depress the clutch fully before changing gear he takes his coffee black and the love interest between my self and dc baker is strictly unrequited is that clearrdquo ldquovery clearrdquo i returned thankful i would not have to do anylove scenes ldquogood did they supply you with all the necessary paper work ids that sort of thingrdquo i patted my pocket and she handed me a scrap of paper and a bunch of keys ldquogood this is my footnoterphone number in case of emergencies these are the keys to the flying boat and my bmw if a loser named arnold calls tell him i hope he rots in hell any questionsrdquo ldquoi donrsquot think sordquo she smiled as a yellow cab with transgenre taxis painted on the side materialized in front of us the cabbie looked bored and mary opened the passenger door ldquothen wersquore done yoursquoll like it here irsquoll see you in about a year so longrdquo she turned to the cabbie muttered ldquoget me out of this bookrdquo and she and the car faded out leaving me alone on the dusty track i sat upon a rickety wooden seat next to a tub of longdead flowers and let pickwick out of her bag she ruffled her feathers indignantly and blinked in the sunlight i looked across the lake at the sailing dinghies that were little more than brightly colored triangles that tacked backwards and forwards in the distance nearer to shore a pair of swans beat their wings furiously and pedaled the water in an attempt to take off landing almost as soon as they were airborne throwing up a long streak of spray on the calm waters it seemed a lot of effort to go a few hundred yards i turned my attention to the flying boat the layers of paint that covered and protected the riveted hull had partly peeled off to reveal the colorful livery of longforgotten airlines beneath the perspex windows had clouded with age and high in the massive wing untidy cables hung lazily from the oilstained cowlings of the three empty engine bays their safe inaccessibility now a haven for nesting birds goliath aornis and specops seemed a million miles away151but then so did landen landen memories of my husband were never far away i thought of all the times we had spent together that hadnrsquot actually happened all the places we hadnrsquot visited all the things we hadnrsquot done he might have been eradicated at the age

restful stint in the character exchange program down in the hidden depths of the well of lost plots shersquos supposed to relax while filling in for a sidekick in an unpublished and unpublishable detective procedural socked away below the great library in the well of lost plots but a vacation remains elusive in no time thursday discovers that the well of lost plots is a veritable linguistic freeforall where grammasites run rampant plot devices are hawked on the black market and lousy books like the one she has taken up residence in are scrapped for salvage to top it off a murderer is stalking jurisfiction personnel and nobody is safe least of all thursday herself fforde has done it again in this absolutely brilliant feat of literary showmanship when it comes to sheer wit literate fantasy and effervescent originality nobody can touch this new tour de fforde if contentwrittenno coresetid50 symexc contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite the well of lost plots to understand the well you have to have an idea of the layout of the great library the library is where all published fiction is stored so it can be read by the readers in the outland there are twentysix floors one for each letter of the alphabet the library is constructed in the layout of a cross with the four corridors radiating from the center point on all the walls end after end shelf after shelf are books hundreds thousands millions of books hardbacks paperbacks leatherbound everything but the similarity of all these books to the copies we read back home is no more than the similarity a photograph has to its subject these books are alive beneath the great library are twentysix floors of dingy yet industrious subbasements known as the well of lost plots this is where books are constructed honed and polished in readiness for a place in the library above151if they make it that far the failure rate is high unpublished books outnumber published by an estimated eight to one thursday next the jurisfiction chronicles making onersquos home in an unpublished novel wasnrsquot without its compensations all the boring daytoday mundanities that we conduct in the real world get in the way of narrative flow and are thus generally avoided the car didnrsquot need refueling there were never any wrong numbers there was always enough hot water and vacuum cleaner bags came in only two sizes151 upright and pull along there were other more subtle differences too for instance no one ever needed to repeat themselves in case you didnrsquot hear no one shared the same name talked at the same time or had a word annoyingly ldquoon the tip of their tonguerdquo best of all the bad guy was always someone you knew of and151 chaucer aside151there wasnrsquot much farting but there were some downsides the relative absence of breakfast was the first and most notable difference to my daily timetable inside books dinners are often written about and therefore feature frequently as do lunches and afternoon tea probably because they offer more opportunities to further the story breakfast wasnrsquot all that was missing there was a peculiar lack of cinemas wallpaper toilets colors books animals underwear smells haircuts and strangely enough minor illnesses if some one was ill in a book it was either terminal and dramatically un pleasant or a mild head cold151there wasnrsquot much in between i was able to take up residence inside fiction by virtue of a scheme entitled the character exchange program due to a spate of bored and disgruntled bookpeople escaping from their novels and becoming what we called pagerunners the authorities set up the scheme to allow characters a change of scenery in any year there are close to ten thousand exchanges few of which result in any major plot or dialogue infringements151the reader rarely suspects anything at all since i was from the real world and not actually a character at all the bellman and miss havisham had agreed to let me live inside the bookworld in ex change for helping out at junsfiction151at least as long as my pregnancy would allow the choice of book for my selfenforced exile had not been a bitrary when miss havisham asked me in which novel i would care to reside i had thought long and hard robinson crusoe would have been ideal considering the climate but there was no one female to exchange with i could have gone to pride and prejudice but i wasnrsquot wild about high collars bonnets corsets151 and delicate manners no to avoid any complications and reduce the possibility of having to move i had decided to make my home in a book of such dubious and uneven quality that publication and my subsequent enforced ejection was unlikely in the extreme i found just such a book deep within the well of lost plots amongst failed attempts at prose and halffinished epics of such dazzling ineptness that they would never see the light of day the book was a dreary crime thriller set in reading entitled caversham heights i had planned to stay there for only a year but it didnrsquot work out that way plans with me are like de floss novels151try as you might you never know quite how they are going to turn out i read my way into cavers ham heights the air felt warm after the wintry conditions back home and i found myself standing on a wooden jetty at the edge of a lake in front of me there was a large and seemingly derelict flying boat of the sort that still plied the coastal routes back home i had flown on one myself not six months before on the trail of someone claiming to have found some unpublished burns poetry but that was another lifetime ago when i was specops in swindon the world i had temporarily left behind the ancient flying boat rocked gently in the breeze tautening the mooring ropes and creaking gently the water gently slapping against the hull as i watched the old aircraft wondering just how long something this decrepit could stay afloat a welldressed young woman stepped out of an ovalshaped door in the high sided hull she was carrying a suitcase i had read the novel of caversham heights so i knew mary well although she didnrsquot know me ldquohullordquo she shouted trotting up and offering me a hand ldquoirsquom mary you must be thursday my goodness whatrsquos thatrdquo ldquoa dodo her namersquos pickwickrdquo pickwick plocked and stared at mary suspiciously ldquoreallyrdquo she replied looking at the bird curiously ldquoirsquom no expert of course but151i thought dodos were extinctrdquo ldquowhere i come from theyrsquore a bit of a pestrdquo ldquoohrdquo mused mary ldquoirsquom not sure irsquove heard of a book with live dodos in itrdquo ldquoirsquom not a bookpersonrdquo i told her ldquoirsquom realrdquo ldquoohrdquo exclaimed mary opening her eyes wide ldquoan outlanderrdquo she touched me inquisitively with a slender index finger as though i might be made of glass ldquoirsquove never seen someone from the other side beforerdquo she announced clearly relieved to find that i wasnrsquot going to shatter into a thousand pieces ldquotell me is it true you have to cut your hair on a regular basis i mean your hair actually growsrdquo ldquoyesrdquo151i smiled151rdquoand my fingernails toordquo ldquoreallyrdquo mused mary ldquoirsquove heard rumors about that but i thought it was just one of those outlandish legends i suppose you have to eat too to stay alive i mean not just when the story calls for itrdquo ldquoone of the great pleasures of liferdquo i assured her i didnrsquot think irsquod tell her about realworld downsides such as tooth decay incontinence or old age mary lived in a threeyear window and neither aged died married had children got sick or changed in any way although appearing resolute and strong minded she was only like this because she was written that way for all her qualities mary was simply a foil to jack spratt the detective in caversham heights the loyal sergeant figure to whom jack explained things so the readers knew what was going on she was what writers called an expositional but irsquod never be as impolite to say so to her face ldquois this where irsquom going to liverdquo i was pointing at the shabby flying boat ldquoi know what yoursquore thinkingrdquo mary smiled proudly ldquoisnrsquot she just the most beautiful thing ever shersquos a sunderland built in 1943 but last flew in lsquo68 irsquom midway converting her to a houseboat but donrsquot feel shy if you want to help out just keep the bilges pumped out and if you can run the number three engine once a month irsquod be very grateful151the startup checklist is on the flight deck ldquowell151okayrdquo i muttered ldquogood irsquove left a preacutecis of the story taped to the fridge and a rough idea of what you have to say but donrsquot worry about being word perfect since wersquore not published you can say almost any thing you want151within reason of courserdquo ldquoof courserdquo i thought for a moment ldquoirsquom new to the character exchange program when will i be called to do somethingrdquo ldquowyatt is the inbook exchange liaison officer hersquoll let you know jack might seem gruff to begin withrdquo continued mary ldquobut he has a heart of gold if he asks you to drive his austin allegro make sure you depress the clutch fully before changing gear he takes his coffee black and the love interest between my self and dc baker is strictly unrequited is that clearrdquo ldquovery clearrdquo i returned thankful i would not have to do anylove scenes ldquogood did they supply you with all the necessary paper work ids that sort of thingrdquo i patted my pocket and she handed me a scrap of paper and a bunch of keys ldquogood this is my footnoterphone number in case of emergencies these are the keys to the flying boat and my bmw if a loser named arnold calls tell him i hope he rots in hell any questionsrdquo ldquoi donrsquot think sordquo she smiled as a yellow cab with transgenre taxis painted on the side materialized in front of us the cabbie looked bored and mary opened the passenger door ldquothen wersquore done yoursquoll like it here irsquoll see you in about a year so longrdquo she turned to the cabbie muttered ldquoget me out of this bookrdquo and she and the car faded out leaving me alone on the dusty track i sat upon a rickety wooden seat next to a tub of longdead flowers and let pickwick out of her bag she ruffled her feathers indignantly and blinked in the sunlight i looked across the lake at the sailing dinghies that were little more than brightly colored triangles that tacked backwards and forwards in the distance nearer to shore a pair of swans beat their wings furiously and pedaled the water in an attempt to take off landing almost as soon as they were airborne throwing up a long streak of spray on the calm waters it seemed a lot of effort to go a few hundred yards i turned my attention to the flying boat the layers of paint that covered and protected the riveted hull had partly peeled off to reveal the colorful livery of longforgotten airlines beneath the perspex windows had clouded with age and high in the massive wing untidy cables hung lazily from the oilstained cowlings of the three empty engine bays their safe inaccessibility now a haven for nesting birds goliath aornis and specops seemed a million miles away151but then so did landen landen memories of my husband were never far away i thought of all the times we had spent together that hadnrsquot actually happened all the places we hadnrsquot visited all the things we hadnrsquot done he might have been eradicated at the age of two but i still had our memories151 just no one to share them with i was interrupted from my thoughts by the sound of a motor cycle approaching the rider didnrsquot have much control of the vehicle i was glad that he stopped short of the jetty151his erratic riding might well have led him straight into the lake ldquohullordquo he said cheerfully removing his helmet to reveal a youngish man with a dark mediterranean complexion and deep sunken eyes ldquomy namersquos arnold i havenrsquot seen you around here before have irdquo i got up and shook his hand ldquothe namersquos next thursday next character exchange programrdquo ldquooh blastrdquo he muttered ldquoblast and double blast i suppose that means irsquove missed herrdquo i nodded and he shook his head sadly ldquodid she leave a message for merdquo ldquoyesrdquo i said uncertainly ldquoshe said she would um see you when she gets backrdquo ldquoshe didrdquo replied arnold brightening up ldquothatrsquos a good sign normally she calls me a loser and tells me to go rot in hellrdquo ldquoshe probably wonrsquot be back for a whilerdquo i added trying to make up for not passing on maryrsquos message properly ldquomaybe a year151maybe morerdquo ldquoi seerdquo he murmured sighing deeply and staring off across the lake he caught sight of pickwick who was attempting to outstare a strange aquatic bird with a rounded bill ldquowhatrsquos thatrdquo he asked suddenly ldquoi think itrsquos a duck although i canrsquot be sure151we donrsquot have any where i come fromrdquo ldquono the other thingrdquo ldquoa dodordquo l ldquowhatrsquos the matterrdquo asked arnold i was getting a footnoterphone signal in the book world people generally communicated like this ldquoa footnoterphone callrdquo i replied ldquobut itrsquos not a message151itrsquos like the wireless back homerdquo 2 arnold stared at me ldquoyoursquore not from around here are yourdquo ldquoirsquom from the other side of the page what you call the outlandrdquo 3 he opened his eyes wide ldquoyou mean151yoursquore realrdquo ldquoirsquom afraid sordquo i replied slightly bemused ldquogoodness is it true that outlanders canrsquot say lsquoredbuick bluebuickrsquo many times quicklyrdquo ldquoitrsquos true we call it a tongue twisterrdquo ldquofascinating therersquos nothing like that here you know i can say lsquothe sixth sheikhrsquos sixth sheeprsquos sickrsquo over and over as many times as i wantrdquo and he did three times ldquonow you tryrdquo i took a deep breath ldquothe sixth spleeps sics sleeks sickrdquo arnold laughed like a drain i donrsquot think hersquod come across anything quite so funny in his life i smiled ldquodo it againrdquo ldquono thanks how do i stop this footnoterphone blabbering inside my skullrdquo ldquojust think off very stronglyrdquo i did and the footnoterphone stopped ldquobetterrdquo i nodded ldquoyoursquoll get the hang of itrdquo he thought for a minute looked up and down the lake in a overtly innocent manner then said ldquodo you want to buy some verbs not any of your rubbish either good strong healthy regulars151straight from the text sea151i have a friend on a scrawltrawlerrdquo i smiled ldquoi donrsquot think so arnold151and i donrsquot think you should ask me151irsquom jurisfictionrdquo ldquoohrdquo said arnold looking pale all of a sudden he bit his lip and gave such an imploring look that i almost laughed ldquodonrsquot sweatrdquo i told him ldquoi wonrsquot report itrdquo he sighed a deep sigh of relief muttered his thanks re mounted his motorbike and drove off in a jerky fashion narrowly missing the mailboxes at the top of the track the interior of the flying boat was lighter and more airy than i had imagined but it smelt a bit musty mary was mistaken she had not been halfway through the craftrsquos conversion151it was more like onetenth the walls were halfpaneled with pine tongue andgroove and rockwool insulation stuck out untidily along with unused electrical cables there was room for two floors within the boatrsquos cavernous hull the downstairs a large openplan living room with a couple of old sofas pointing towards a television set i tried to switch it on but it was dead151there was no tv in the bookworld unless called for in the narrative much of what i could see around me were merely props necessary for the chapter in which jack spratt visits the sunderland to discuss the case on the mantelpiece above a small woodburning stove were pictures of mary from her days at the police training college and another from when she was promoted to detective sergeant i opened a door that led into a small kitchenette attached to the fridge was the preacutecis of caversham heights i flicked through it the sequence of events was pretty much as i remembered from my first reading in the well although it seemed that mary had overstated her role in some of the puzzlesolving areas i put the preacutecis down found a bowl and filled it with water for pickwick took her egg from my bag and laid it on the sofa where she quickly set about turning it over and tapping it gently with her beak i went forward and discovered a bedroom where the nose turret would have been and climbed a narrow aluminum ladder to the flight deck directly above this was the best view in the house the large greenhouselike perspex windows affording a good view of the lake the massive control wheels were set in front of two comfortable chairs and facing them and ahead of a tangled mass of engine control levers was a complex panel of broken and faded instruments to my right i could see the one remaining engine looking forlorn the propeller blades streaked with bird droppings behind the pilotsrsquo seats where the flight engineer would have sat there was a desk with reading lamp footnoterphone and typewriter on the bookshelf were mainly magazines of a police nature and lots of forensic textbooks i walked through a narrow doorway and found a pleasant bedroom the headroom was not overgenerous but it was cozy and dry and was paneled in pine with a porthole above the double bed behind the bedroom was a storeroom a hotwater boiler stacks of wood and a spiral staircase i was just about to go downstairs when i heard someone speak from the living room below ldquowhat do you think that isrdquo the voice had an empty ring to it and was neuter in its inflection151i couldnrsquot tell if it was male or female i stopped and instinctively pulled my automatic from my shoulder holster mary lived alone151or so it had said in the book as i moved slowly downstairs i heard another voice answer the first ldquoi think itrsquos a bird of some sortrdquo the second voice was no more distinctive than the first and indeed if the second voice had not been answering the first i might have thought they belonged to the same person as i rounded the staircase i saw two figures standing in the middle of the room staring at pickwick who stared back courageously protecting her egg from behind the sofa ldquoheyrdquo i said pointing my gun in their direction ldquohold it right thererdquo the two figures looked up and stared at me without expression from features that were as insipid and muted as their voices because of their equal blandness it was impossible to tell them apart their arms hung limply by their sides exhibiting no body language they might have been angry or curious or worried or elated151but i couldnrsquot tell ldquowho are yourdquo i asked ldquowe are nobodyrdquo replied the one on the left ldquoeveryone is someonerdquo i replied ldquonot altogether correctrdquo said the one on the right ldquowe have a code number but nothing more i am
