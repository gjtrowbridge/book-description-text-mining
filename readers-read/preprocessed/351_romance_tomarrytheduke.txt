 chapter one the london season 1881 with a sigh of resignation sophia wilson realized she had unwittingly hurled herself not only across an ocean to london but from a sizzlinghot frying pan into a fierce and fiery blaze she was about to enter the marriage mart she moved with her mother into the crowded london drawing room elegantly adorned with silk tapestries and bouquets of roses tied with ribbons and a host of other useless knickknacks skillfully arranged to make perfect idleness the only option squeezing her fan tightly in her gloved fist she prepared herself after a month of intense english etiquette training for the introduction to the earl and countess of somethingorother then dutifully smiled her best smile that wasnt so terrible was it her mother whispered afterward assessing the room as she spoke sophia could almost hear her mothers thoughts aloud as she formulated the evenings strategy an earl here a marquess there the weight of sophias responsibility hung over her then like an iron chandelier dangling from a single screw ready to drop at any moment she was an american heiress and she was here in london to ensure her familys acceptance into high society back home and ultimately change their lives forever she was here to marry an english lord at least that was what she had promised her mother when escape had become her only hope for sophia had turned down four proposals in the past year very good ones in her mothers frequently professed opinion and her mother had begun to bang her head against the wall the last gentleman had been a peabody and good gracious a wilson marrying a peabody would have been a coup like no other it would have secured an invitation to the patriarchs balls mrs astor the mrs astor might even have paid the bourgeois wilsons a call the highsociety matriarch would have hated it of course all this marital desperation because sophias family was one of many new families to try to break into the impenetrable old new york society arrivistes they were called the nouveaux riches they knew what they were and they all wanted in sophia gazed despondently at the hordes of strangers in the room listened distractedly to the cool reserved english laughter if one could call it laughter her sisters certainly wouldnt she sighed reminding herself how important it was to find a man she could love before the end of the season she had made a deal with her mother so the poor woman wouldnt make herself ill again the only way her mother would let sophia off the hook regarding the peabody proposal without having an episode and calling the doctor again was with the promise of a bigger fish since bigger fish were found exclusively in london bigger fish with titles no less here they were sophia only hoped she could find a romantic fish a handsome fish a fish who would love her for herself not her money allow me to present my daughter miss sophia wilson her mother said as she introduced her to a group of ladies each with daughters of their own by their sides for a moment the englishwomen were silent as they took in her appearance her worth gown her emeraldcut diamond pendant her diamondcluster drop earrings none of the english girls wore such extravagant jewels and they gazed at her with envious looks on their faces sophia felt suddenly like a fish herself very much out of her familiar waters youre from america one of the women said at last flicking open her fan and fluttering it in front of her face waiting somewhat impatiently for sophias reply yes from new york were guests of the countess of lansdowne the countess as it happened was also american and in new york she was known as one of the very best social godmothers she had married the earl of lansdowne three years previous and had somehow managed to fit into london society as if she had been born and raised here the wilsons had known florence in new york before she had married the earl florence too had been on the outside looking in had received the cold shoulder one too many times and now took great pleasure in thumbing her nose back at those same highnosed knickerbockers she secured her revenge by assisting the socalled upstarts like sophia and her mother up the long and often slippery social ladder and sending the families home to new york with impressive english titles in their bursting beaded reticules yes were familiar with the countess the taciturn englishwoman replied exchanging a knowing nod with her companions no more was said and sophia did her best to smile the evening suddenly stretching before her like a long monotonous road with carriages halted and lined up for miles at that moment a hush fell over the room followed by a few scattered whispers its the duke is it the duke my word it is the duke all heads turned toward the door the majordomos deep booming voice announced his grace the duke of wentworth as sophia waited for the dukes entrance her american opinions about equality bucked in her head duke or ditch digger hes still just a man she rose up on her toes to see over peoples heads and get a peek at the highestranking peer in the room but leaned back when one of the young english girls in her group whispered in her ear avoid him if you can unless you want to marry into a nightmare sophia faced the girl who paled and took a step back discouraging any further conversation
