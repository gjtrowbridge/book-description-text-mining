 introduction ndash the seventh sense either this will ring bells for you or it wonrsquot a printed banner has appeared on the concourse of a petrol station near to where i live ldquocome insiderdquo it says ldquofor cdrsquos videorsquos dvdrsquos and bookrsquosrdquo if this satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse you should probably put down this book at once by all means congratulate yourself that you are not a pedant or even a stickler that you are happily equipped to live in a world of plummeting punctuation standards but just donrsquot bother to go any further for any true stickler you see the sight of the plural word ldquobookrsquosrdquo with an apostrophe in it will trigger a ghastly private emotional process similar to the stages of bereavement though greatly accelerated first there is shock within seconds shock gives way to disbelief disbelief to pain and pain to anger finally and this is where the analogy breaks down anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage with the aid of a permanent marker itrsquos tough being a stickler for punctuation these days one almost dare not get up in the mornings true one occasionally hears a marvellous punctuationfan joke about a panda who ldquoeats shoots and leavesrdquo but in general the sticklerrsquos exquisite sensibilities are assaulted from all sides causing feelings of panic and isolation a sign at a health club will announce ldquoirsquots party time on saturday 24th may we are have a discoparty night for free it will be a ticket only eveningrdquo advertisements offer decorative services to ldquowallrsquos ndash ceilingrsquos ndash doorrsquos ectrdquo meanwhile a newspaper placard announces ldquofanrsquos fury at stadium inquiryrdquo which sounds quite interesting until you look inside the paper and discover that the story concerns a quite large mob of fans actually ndash not just the lone hoppingmad fan so promisingly indicated by the punctuation everywhere one looks there are signs of ignorance and indifference what about that film two weeks notice guaranteed to give sticklers a very nasty turn that was ndash its posters slung along the sides of buses in letters four feet tall with no apostrophe in sight i remember at the start of the two weeks notice publicity campaign in the spring of 2003 emerging cheerfully from victoria station was i whistling and stopping dead in my tracks with my fingers in my mouth where was the apostrophe surely there should be an apostrophe on that bus if it were ldquoone monthrsquos noticerdquo there would be an apostrophe i reasoned yes and if it were ldquoone weekrsquos noticerdquo there would be an apostrophe therefore ldquotwo weeksrsquo noticerdquo requires an apostrophe buses that i should have caught the 73 two 38s sailed off up buckingham palace road while i communed thus at length with my inner stickler unable to move or indeed regain any sense of perspective part of onersquos despair of course is that the world cares nothing for the little shocks endured by the sensitive stickler while we look in horror at a badly punctuated sign the world carries on around us blind to our plight we are like the little boy in the sixth sense who can see dead people except that we can see dead punctuation whisper it in petrified littleboy tones dead punctuation is invisible to everyone else ndash yet we see it all the time no one understands us seventhsense people they regard us as freaks when we point out illiterate mistakes we are often aggressively instructed to ldquoget a liferdquo by people who interestingly display no evidence of having lives themselves naturally we become timid about making our insights known in such inhospitable conditions being burned as a witch is not safely enough off the agenda a sign has gone up in a local charityshop window which says baldly ldquocan you spare any old recordsrdquo no question mark and i dither daily outside on the pavement should i go in and mention it it does matter that therersquos no question mark on a direct question it is appalling ignorance but what will i do if the elderly charityshop lady gives me the usual disbelieving stare and then tells me to bugger off get a life and mind my own business on the other hand irsquom well aware there is little profit in asking for sympathy for sticklers we are not the easiest people to feel sorry for we refuse to patronise any shop with checkouts for ldquoeight items or lessrdquo because it should be ldquofewerrdquo and we got very worked up after 911 not because of osama binladen but because people on the radio kept saying ldquoenormityrdquo when they meant ldquomagnituderdquo and we really hate that when we hear the construction ldquomr blair was stoodrdquo instead of ldquostandingrdquo we suck our teeth with annoyance and when words such as ldquophenomenardquo ldquomediardquo or ldquocherubimrdquo are treated as singular ldquothe media says it was quite a phenomena looking at those cherubimsrdquo some of us cannot suppress actual screams sticklers never read a book without a pencil at hand to correct the typographical errors in short we are unattractive knowall obsessives who get things out of proportion and are in continual peril of being disowned by our exasperated families i know precisely when my own damned stickler personality started to get the better of me in the autumn of 2002 i was making a series of programmes about punctuation for radio 4 called cutting a dash my producer invited john richards of the apostrophe protection society to come and talk to us at that time i was quite tickled by the idea of an apostrophe protection society on whose website could be found photographic examples of ungrammatical signs such as ldquothe judges decision is finalrdquo and ldquono dogrsquosrdquo we took mr richards on a trip down berwick street market to record his reaction to some greengrocersrsquo punctuation ldquopotatoersquosrdquo and so on and then sat down for a chat about how exactly one goes about protecting a conventional printerrsquos mark that through no fault of its own seems to be terminally flailing in a welter of confusion what the aps does is write courteous letters he said a typical letter would explain the correct use of the apostrophe and express the gentle wish that should the offending ldquobobs petsrdquo sign with a comma be replaced one day this wellmeant guidance might be borne in mind it was at this point that i felt a profound and unignorable stirring it was the awakening of my inner stickler ldquobut thatrsquos not enoughrdquo i said suddenly i was abuzz with ideas what about issuing stickers printed with the words ldquothis apostrophe is not necessaryrdquo what about telling people to shin up ladders at dead of night with an apostropheshaped stencil and a tin of paint why did the apostrophe protection society not have a militant wing could i start one where do you get balaclavas punctuation has been defined many ways some grammarians use the analogy of stitching punctuation as the basting that holds the fabric of language in shape another writer tells us that punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language they tell us to slow down notice this take a detour and stop i have even seen a rather fanciful reference to the full stop and comma as ldquothe invisible servants in fairy tales ndash the ones who bring glasses of water and pillows not storms of weather or loverdquo but best of all i think is the simple advice given by the style book of a national newspaper that punctuation is ldquoa courtesy designed to help readers to understand a story without stumblingrdquo isnrsquot the analogy with good manners perfect truly good manners are invisible they ease the way for others without drawing attention to themselves it is no accident that the word ldquopunctiliousrdquo ldquoattentive to formality or etiquetterdquo comes from the same original root word as punctuation as we shall see the practice of ldquopointingrdquo our writing has always been offered in a spirit of helpfulness to underline meaning and prevent awkward misunderstandings between writer and reader in 1644 a schoolmaster from southwark richard hodges wrote in his the english primrose that ldquogreat care ought to be had in writing for the due observing of points for the neglect thereof will pervert the senserdquo and he quoted as an example ldquomy son if sinners intise 91entice93 thee consent thou not refraining thy foot from their wayrdquo imagine the difference to the sense he says if you place the comma after the word ldquonotrdquo ldquomy son if sinners intise thee consent thou not refraining thy foot from their wayrdquo this was the 1644 equivalent of ronnie barker in porridge reading the signoff from a fellow lagrsquos letter from home ldquonow i must go and get on my loverrdquo and then pretending to notice a comma so hastily changing it to ldquonow i must go and get on my loverrdquo to be fair many people who couldnrsquot punctuate their way out of a paper bag are still interested in the way punctuation can alter the sense of a string of words it is the basis of all ldquoirsquom sorry irsquoll read that againrdquo jokes instead of ldquowhat would you with the kingrdquo you can have someone say in marlowersquos edward ii ldquowhat would you with the kingrdquo the consequences of mispunctuation and repunctuation have appealed to both great and little minds and in the age of the fancythat email a popular example is the comparison of two sentences a woman without her man is nothing a woman without her man is nothing which i donrsquot know really makes you think doesnrsquot it here is a popular ldquodear jackrdquo letter that works in much the same fundamentally pointless way dear jack i want a man who knows what love is all about you are generous kind thoughtful people who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior you have ruined me for other men i yearn for you i have no feelings whatsoever when wersquore apart i can be forever happy ndash will you let me be yours jill dear jack i want a man who knows what love is all about you are generous kind thoughtful people who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior you have ruined me for other men i yearn for you i have no feelings whatsoever when wersquore apart i can be forever happy will you let me be yours jill but just to show there is nothing very original about all this five hundred years before email a similarly tiresome puzzle was going round every lady in this land hath 20 nails on each hand five twenty on hands and feet every lady in this land has twenty nails on each hand five and twenty on hands and feet so all this is quite amusing but it is noticeable that no one emails the far more interesting example of the fateful mispunctuated telegram that precipitated the jameson raid on the transvaal in 1896 ndash i suppose thatrsquos a reflection of modern education for you do you know of the jameson raid described as a ldquofiascordquo marvellous punctuation story throw another log on that fire the transvaal was a boer republic at the time and it was believed that the british and other settlers around johannesburg who were denied civil rights would rise up if jameson invaded but unfortunately when the settlers sent their telegraphic invitation to jameson it included a tragic ambiguity it is under these circumstances that we feel constrained to call upon you to come to our aid should a disturbance arise here the circumstances are so extreme that we cannot but believe that you and the men under you will not fail to come to the rescue of people who are so situated as eric partridge points out in his usage and abusage if you place a full stop after the word ldquoaidrdquo in this passage the message is unequivocal it says ldquocome at oncerdquo if you put it after ldquohererdquo however it says something more like ldquowe might need you at some later date depending on what happens here but in the meantime ndash donrsquot call us jameson old boy wersquoll call yourdquo of course the message turned up at the times with a full stop after ldquoaidrdquo no one knows who put it there and poor old jameson just sprang to the saddle without anybody wanting or expecting him to all of which substantiates partridgersquos own metaphor for punctuation which is that itrsquos ldquothe line along which the train composition style writing must travel if it isnrsquot to run away with its driverrdquo in other words punctuation keeps sense on the rails of course people will always argue over levels of punctuation accusing texts of having too much or too little there is an enjoyable episode in peter hallrsquos diaries when in advance of directing albert finney in hamlet he ldquofilletsrdquo the text of ldquopractically all its punctuation except what is essential to senserdquo and then finds he has to live with the consequences on august 21 1975 he notes ldquoshakespearersquos text is always absurdly overpunctuated generations of scholars have tried to turn him into a good grammarianrdquo all of which sounds sensible enough until we find the entry for the first rehearsal on september 22 which he describes as ldquogoodrdquo but also admits was ldquoa rough and ready stumbling reading with people falling over words or misplaced emphasesrdquo what happened to punctuation why is it so disregarded when it is selfevidently so useful in preventing enormous mixups a headline in todayrsquos paper says ldquodead sons photos may be releasedrdquo ndash the story relating to dead sons in the plural but you would never know the obvious culprit is the recent history of education practice we can blame the pedagogues until 1960 punctuation was routinely taught in british schools a child sitting a county schools exam in 1937 would be asked to punctuate the following puzzler ldquocharles the first walked and talked half an hour after his head was cut offrdquo answer ldquocharles the first walked and talked half an hour after his head was cut offrdquo today thank goodness the national curriculum ensures that when children are eight they are drilled in the use of the comma even if their understanding of grammar is at such an early age a bit hazy for cutting a dash we visited a school in cheshire where quite small children were being taught that you use commas in the following situations 1 in a list 2 before dialogue 3 to mark out additional information which was very impressive identifying ldquoadditional informationrdquo at the age of eight is quite an achievement and i know for a fact that i couldnrsquot have done it but if things are looking faintly more optimistic under the national curriculum there remains the awful truth that for over a quarter of a century punctuation and english grammar were simply not taught in the majority of schools with the effect that alevel examiners annually bewailed the condition of examineesrsquo written english while nothing was done candidates couldnrsquot even spell the words ldquogrammarrdquo and ldquosentencerdquo let alone use them in any wellinformed way attending a grammar school myself between 1966 and 1973 i donrsquot remember being taught punctuation either there was a comical moment in the fifth year when our english teacher demanded ldquobut you have had lessons in grammarrdquo and we all looked shifty as if the fault was ours we had been taught latin french and german grammar but english grammar was something we felt we were expected to infer from our reading ndash which is doubtless why i came a cropper over ldquoitsrdquo and ldquoitrsquosrdquo like many uninstructed people i surmised that if there was a version of ldquoitsrdquo with an apostrophe before the ldquosrdquo there was somehow logically bound to be a version of ldquoitsrdquo with an apostrophe after the ldquosrdquo as well a shame no one set me right on this common misapprehension really but there you are i just remember a period when convinced that an apostrophe was definitely required somewhere i would cunningly suspend a very small one immediately above the ldquosrdquo to cover all eventualities imagine my teenage wrath when time after time my homework was returned with this wellmeant floating apostrophe struck out ldquowhyrdquo i would rail using all my powers of schoolgirl inference and getting nowhere hadnrsquot i balanced it perfectly how could the teacher possibly tell i had put it in the wrong place luckily for me i was exceptionally interested in english and got there in the end while other girls were out with boyfriends on sunday afternoons getting their necks disfigured by love bites i was at home with the wireless listening to an ian messiter quiz called many a slip in which erudite and amusing contestants spotted grammatical errors in pieces of prose it was a fantastic programme i dream sometimes they have brought it back panellists such as isobel barnett and david nixon would interrupt roy plomley with a buzz and say ldquotautologyrdquo around this same time when other girls of my age were attending the isle of wight festival and having abortions i bought a copy of eric partridgersquos usage and abusage and covered it in stickybacked plastic so that it would last a lifetime it has funny how i didnrsquot think any of this was peculiar at the time when it was behaviour with ldquoproto sticklerrdquo written all over it but i do see now why it was no accident that i later wound up as a subeditor with a literal blue pencil but to get back to those darksideofthemoon years in british education when teachers upheld the view that grammar and spelling got in the way of selfexpression it is arguable that the timing of their grammatical apathy could not have been worse in the 1970s no educationist would have predicted the explosion in universal written communication caused by the personal computer the internet and the keypad of the mobile phone but now look whatrsquos happened everyonersquos a writer everyone is posting film reviews on amazon that go like this i watched this film 91about a boy93 a few days ago expecting the usual hugh grant bumbling hellip character ive come to loatheexpect over the years i was thoroughly suprised this film was great one of the best films i have seen in a long time the film focuses around one man who starts going to a single parents meeting to meet women one problem he doesnt have a child isnrsquot this sad people who have been taught nothing about their own language are contrary to educational expectations spending all their leisure hours attempting to string sentences together for the edification of others and there is no editing on the internet meanwhile in the world of text messages ignorance of grammar and punctuation obviously doesnrsquot affect a personrsquos ability to communicate messages such as ldquoc u laterrdquo but if you try anything longer it always seems to turn out much like the writing of the infant pip in great expectations mi deer jo i ope u r krwite well i ope i shal son b habell 4 2 teedge u jo an then we shorl b so glodd an wen i m prengtd 2 u jo wot larx an bleve me inf xn pip now there are many people who claim that they do fully punctuate text messages for cutting a dash we asked people in the street outside the palladium theatre as it happens at about 5pm if they used proper punctuation when sending text messages and were surprised ndash not to say incredulous ndash when nine of out ten people said yes some of them said they used semicolons and parentheses and everything ldquoirsquom a grammar geekrdquo explained one young new zealand woman ldquoirsquom trying to teach my teenage son to punctuate properlyrdquo said a nice scholarlylooking man i kept offering these respondents an easy way out ldquoitrsquos a real fag going through that punctuation menu though i mean it would be quite understandable if you couldnrsquot be botheredrdquo but we had evidently stumbled into grammar geek alley and there was nothing we could do ldquoof course i punctuate my text messages i did alevel englishrdquo one young man explained with a look of scorn evidently an a level in english is a sacred trust like something out of the lord of the rings you must go forth with your a level and protect the english language with your bow of elfin gold but do you know what i didnrsquot believe those people either they were weirdly selfselecting or they were simply lying for the microphone point out to the newsagent that ldquodead sons photos may be releasedrdquo is not grammatically complete and he will hastily change the subject to the price of milk stand outside a leicester square cinema indicating ndash with a cutout apostrophe on a stick ndash how the title two weeks notice might be easily grammatically corrected i did this and not a soul will take your side or indeed have a clue what your problem is and thatrsquos sad taking our previous analogies for punctuation what happens when it isnrsquot used well if punctuation is the stitching of language language comes apart obviously and all the buttons fall off if punctuation provides the traffic signals words bang into each other and everyone ends up in minehead if one can bear for a moment to think of punctuation marks as those invisibly beneficent fairies irsquom sorry our poor deprived language goes parched and pillowless to bed and if you take the courtesy analogy a sentence no longer holds the door open for you to walk in but drops it in your face as you approach the reason itrsquos worth standing up for punctuation is not that itrsquos an arbitrary system of notation known only to an oversensitive elite who have attacks of the vapours when they see it misapplied the reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning punctuation herds words together keeps others apart punctuation directs you how to read in the way musical notation directs a musician how to play as we shall see in the chapter on commas it was first used by greek dramatists two thousand years ago to guide actors between breathing points ndash thus leading to the modern explanation of why a cat is not a comma a cat has claws at the ends of its paws a commarsquos a pause at the end of a clause words strung together without punctuation recall those murky murals rolf harris used to paint where you kept tilting your head and wondering what it was then rolf would dip a small brush into a pot of white and ndash to the deathless teasing line ldquocan you guess what it is yetrdquo ndash add a line here a dot there a curly bit and suddenly all was clear good heavens it looked like just a splodge of colours and all along it was a kangaroo in football boots having a sandwich similarly take a bit of unpunctuated prose add the dots and flourishes in the right place stand back and what have you got my dear joe i hope you are quite well i hope i shall soon be able to teach you joe ndash and then we shall be so glad and when i am apprenticed to you joe what larks believe me in affection pip every language expert from dr johnson onwards has accepted that itrsquos a mistake to attempt to ldquoembalm the languagerdquo of course it must change and adapt when the time comes that piprsquos original text is equally readable with the one above then our punctuation system can be declared dead and no one will mind in the chapters that follow we will see how it is in the nature of printersrsquo conventions which is all punctuation marks are to develop over time usually in the cause of making language less fussy on the page it is useful to remember however ndash as we struggle to preserve a system under attack ndash that a reader from a couple of hundred years ago would be shocked by presentday punctuation that we now regard as flawless and elegant why donrsquot we use capital letters for all nouns any more why donrsquot we use full stops after everyday abbreviations why not combine colons with dashes sometimes where did all the commas go why isnrsquot there a hyphen in ldquotodayrdquo lawksamussy what sort of punctuation chickens are we at the beginning of the 21st century well taking just the initial capital letters and the terminating full stop the rest will come later they have not always been there the initial letter of a sentence was first capitalised in the 13th century but the rule was not consistently applied until the 16th in manuscripts of the 4th to 7th centuries the first letter of the page was decorated regardless of whether it was the start of a sentence ndash and indeed while we are on the subject of decorated letters who can forget the scene in not the nine orsquoclock news in which an elderly exhausted monk unbent himself after years of illuminating the first page of the bible only to see that he had written gloriously ldquobenesisrdquo nowadays the convention for starting a new sentence with a capital letter is so ingrained that wordprocessing software will not allow you to type a full stop and then a lower case letter it will capitalise automatically this is bad news obviously for chaps like ee cummings but good news for those who have spotted the inexorable advance of lower case into book titles television captions company names and of course everything on the noncasesensitive internet and lie awake at night worrying about the confusion this is spreading in young minds meanwhile the full stop is surely the simplest mark to understand ndash so long as everyone continues to have some idea what a sentence is which is a condition that canrsquot be guaranteed as the original ldquopointrdquo so called by chaucer it appears to occupy a place in our grammar that is unassailable every time the sentence ends there is a full stop or a fullstop substitute such as the exclamation mark or the question mark as easy as that if you resort to full stops all the time by the way and donrsquot use anything else and keep to very short sentences people who have read h w fowlerrsquos the kingrsquos english 1906 will accuse you of ldquospot plaguerdquo and perhaps also assume you are modelling yourself on ernest hemingway but the good news is you canrsquot go wrong grammatically the american name ldquoperiodrdquo incidentally was one of its original english names too just as the word ldquocommardquo originally referred to the piece of writing itself rather than the mark that contained it so ldquoperiodrdquo referred to a longer piece of writing shakespeare called the full stop a period in a midsummer nightrsquos dream when he described nervous players ldquomaking periods in the midst of sentencesrdquo this was on the occasion of one of the first and unfunniest scenes of someone wrecking the sense of a speech by putting the full stops in the wrong place we do not come as minding to content you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here william shakespeare a midsummer nightrsquos dream act v scene i ho hum but we should not be complacent even on behalf of the robust and unambiguous full stop young people call them dots you know they are now accustomed to following a full stop with a lowercase letter and no space ask them to write ldquoseventhirtyrdquo in figures 730 and they will probably either put a colon in it because their american software uses a colon for 730 or write 730 or 7rsquo30 meanwhile the illiterate default punctuation mark is nowadays the comma which gives even more cause for alarm the tap water is safe to drink in tea and coffee however we recommend using bottled water for drinking it can be purchased very cheaply in the nearby shops sixty years ago when he wrote mind the stop g v carey gave just one paragraph to the apostrophe because there was so little to say about it ldquoif only all marks were so easyrdquo he sighed but this was in an age when people had been taught the difference between ldquoam i looking at my dinner or the dogrsquosrdquo and ldquoam i looking at my dinner or the dogsrdquo what i hope will become clear from this book is that one can usefully combine a descriptive and prescriptive approach to what is happening to this single aspect of the language the descriptive sort of linguist tends to observe change in the language note it analyse it and manage not to wake up screaming every night he will opine that if say the apostrophe is turning up in words such as ldquobooksrdquo then thatrsquos a sure sign nobody knows how to use it any more that it has outlasted its usefulness it is like tinkerbell with her little light fading sustained only by elicited applause it will ultimately fade extinguish and die this is a highly sane and healthy point of view of course ndash if a little emotionally cool meanwhile at the other end of the spectrum severely prescriptive grammarians would argue that since they were taught at school in 1943 that you must never start a sentence with ldquoandrdquo or ldquobutrdquo the modern world is benighted by ignorance and folly and most of modern literature should be burned somewhere between these positions is where i want us to end up staunch because we understand the advantages of being staunch flexible because we understand the rational and historical necessity to be flexible in mind the stop carey defines punctuation as being governed ldquotwothirds by rule and onethird by personal tasterdquo my own position is simple in some matters of punctuation there are simple rights and wrongs in others one must apply a good ear to good sense i want the greatest clarity from punctuation which means supremely that i want apostrophes where they should be and i will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep in my hand hang on didnrsquot ldquojerusalemrdquo begin with an ldquoandrdquo until everyone knows the difference between ldquoitsrdquo and ldquoitrsquosrdquo and bloody well nobody writes about ldquodead sons photosrdquo without indicating whether the photos in question show one son or several there is a rumour that in parts of the civil service workers have been pragmatically instructed to omit apostrophes because no one knows how to use them any more ndash and this is the kind of pragmatism i say along with winston churchill ldquoup with which we shall not putrdquo how dare anyone make this decision on behalf of the apostrophe what gives the civil service ndash or indeed warner brothers ndash the right to decide our tinkerbell should die how long will it be before a mainstream publisher allows an illiterate title into print how long before the last few punctuation sticklers are obliged to take refuge together in caves so what i propose is action sticklers unite you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion and arguably you didnrsquot have a lot of that to begin with maybe we wonrsquot change the world but at least wersquoll feel better the important thing is to unleash your inner stickler while at the same time not getting punched on the nose or arrested for damage to private property you know the campaign called ldquopipe downrdquo against the use of piped music well ours will be ldquopipe uprdquo be a nuisance do something and if possible use a bright red pen send back emails that are badly punctuated return letters picket harrods who cares if members of your family abhor your inner stickler and devoutly wish you had an inner scoobydoo instead at least if you adopt a zero tolerance approach when you next see a banner advertising ldquocdrsquos dvdrsquos videorsquos and bookrsquosrdquo you wonrsquot just stay indoors getting depressed about it instead you will engage in some directaction argybargy because ndash herersquos the important thing ndash you wonrsquot be alone thatrsquos always been the problem for sticklers you see the feeling of isolation the feeling of nerdishness one solitary obsessive feebly armed with an apostrophe on a stick will never have the nerve to demonstrate outside warner brothers on the issue of two weeks notice but if enough people could pull together in a common cause who knows what we might accomplish there are many obstacles to overcome here not least our national characteristics of reserve itrsquos impolite to tell someone theyrsquore wrong apathy someone else will do it and outright cowardice is it worth being duffed up for the sake of a terminally ailing printerrsquos convention but i have faith i do have faith and i also have an inner stickler that having been unleashed is now roaring salivating and clawing the air in a quite alarming manner there is just one final thing holding us back then it is that every man is his own stickler and while i am very much in favour of forming an army of wellinformed punctuation vigilantes i can foresee problems getting everyone to pull in the same direction there will be those for example who insist that the oxford comma is an abomination the second comma in ldquoham eggs and chipsrdquo whereas others are unmoved by the oxford comma but incensed by the trend towards underhyphenation ndash which the oxford comma people have quite possibly never even noticed yes as evelyn waugh wrote ldquoeveryone has always regarded any usage but his own as either barbarous or pedanticrdquo or as kingsley amis put it less delicately in his book the kingrsquos english 1997 the world of grammar is divided into ldquoberks and wankersrdquo ndash berks being those who are outrageously slipshod about language and wankers those who are in our view abhorrently overprecise left to the berks the english language would ldquodie of impurity like late latinrdquo left to the wankers it would die instead of purity ldquolike medieval latinrdquo of course the drawback is implicit when you by nature subscribe to the view that everyone except yourself is a berk or a wanker it is hard to bond with anybody in any rational common cause you think those thuggish chaps in movie heist gangs fall out a bit too quickly and mindlessly well sticklers are worse the czech novelist milan kundera once fired a publisher who insisted on replacing a semicolon with a full stop meanwhile fulltime editors working together on the same publication using the same style book will put hyphens in take them out and put them in again ndash all day if necessary the marginal direction to printers ldquostetrdquo meaning ldquolet it standrdquo and cancelling an alteration gets used rather a lot in these conditions at the listener where i was literary editor from 1986 to 1990 i discovered that any efforts i made to streamline the prose on my pages would always be challenged by one particular subeditor who would proofread my book reviews and archly insert literally dozens of little commas ndash each one of which i felt as a dart in my flesh of course i never revealed the annoyance she caused i would thank her glance at the blizzard of marks on the galley proof wait for her to leave the room and then standing up to get a better run at it attack the proof feverishly crossing out everything she had added and writing ldquostetrsquorsquo ldquostetrdquo ldquostetrdquo ldquostetrdquo ldquostetrdquo all down the page until my arm got tired and i was spent and donrsquot forget this comma contention was not a matter of right or wrong it was just a matter of taste eats shoots leaves is not a book about grammar i am not a grammarian to me a subordinate clause will for ever be since i heard the actor martin jarvis describe it thus one of santarsquos little helpers a degree in english language is not a prerequisite for caring about where a bracket is preferred to a dash or a comma needs to be replaced by a semicolon if i did not believe that everyone is capable of understanding where an apostrophe goes i would not be writing this book even as a book about punctuation it will not give all the answers there are already umpteen excellent punctuation guides on the market there is even a rather delightful publication for children called the punctuation repair kit which takes the line ldquohey itrsquos uncool to be stupidrdquo ndash which is a lie of course but you have to admire them for trying the trouble with all of these grammar books is that they are read principally by keen foreigners meanwhile native englishspeakers who require their help are the last people who will make the effort to buy and read them i am reminded of a scene in woody allenrsquos small time crooks when an oily hugh grant offers to help ignoramuses allen and tracey ullman newly wealthy with any sort of cultural education ldquois there anything you want to knowrdquo he asks allen who has been sullen throughout the interview and allen says reluctantly ldquowell i would like to learn how to spell connecticutrdquo what a great line that is i would like to learn how to spell connecticut if yoursquove similarly always wanted to know where to use an apostrophe it means you never will doesnrsquot it if only because itrsquos so extremely easy to find out so if this book doesnrsquot instruct about punctuation what does it do well you know those selfhelp books that give you permission to love yourself this one gives you permission to love punctuation itrsquos about how we got the punctuation we have today how such a tiny but adaptable system of marks allows us to notate most but not all types of verbal expression and how according to beachcomber a greengrocer in days of yore inspired good queen bess to create the post of apostropher royal but mainly itrsquos about making sticklers feel good about their seventhsense ability to see dead punctuation whisper it in vergeoftears tones ldquoit doesnrsquot know itrsquos deadrdquo and to defend their sense of humour i have two cartoons i treasure the first shows a row of ten roman soldiers one of them prone on the ground with the cheerful caption from a survivor of the cull ldquohey this decimation isnrsquot as bad as they say it isrdquo the second shows a bunch of vague stupidlooking
