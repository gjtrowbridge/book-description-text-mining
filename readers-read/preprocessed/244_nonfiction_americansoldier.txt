my understanding of the world and its consequences of right and wrong good and evil began when i was five in central oklahoma that may be hard to believe but its true it was my father ray franks who taught me those lessons you pull up just as hard as you push down tommy ray dad said he was trimming twobyfours for our barn roof with a handsaw on the tailgate of the old ford pickup the saw blade snarled down through the board and ripped up with a thinner sound his right arm tanned like leather under the short sleeve of a washedout shirt bulged as he leaned his stocky weight into the saw it was summer nice in the shade of the cottonwood trees near the barn i was barefoot in faded bib overalls that were getting short in the legs sitting in the dirt watching my father work listening closely as always to his softspoken words he smiled a lot and liked to josh around but when we were alone together my dad often took a moment to explain the things hed learned in his life here tommy ray he said tossing me a couple of splintery cuttings you can play with these blocks but dad they aint real toys arent real toys he corrected flipping another board end to me but they are you see a few years back kids had to make do with toys their daddies made for them they couldnt just drive to the fiveanddime in town and buy readymade i fingered the wood still hot from the saw blade how come he wiped his face with a handkerchief laid another plank across the tailgate and lined up the saw well tommy ray we had a war most of the countries in the whole world were fighting america had to fight the germans and the japanese millions and millions of guys my age and younger were soldiers and sailors and flyers and had to go fight fight i thought that was like when the barnyard chickens went rolling around pecking and squawking or like when the big kids walking to school in the winter threw ice balls but what would make a million soldiers and sailors fight how come dad bad people tommy ray the japanese attacked us at a place called pearl harbor it went on for years and a lot of our boys didnt come home whered they go father laid down the saw and smiled that soft grin he had when he needed to explain something sad like when ginger the cat got hit by a truck well those boys got killed they died for america tommy ray my mother said people went to heaven when they died those boys went to fight and just kept going till they got to heaven did you go fight i was in the army air corps tommy ray i fixed airplanes for the boys to fly i didnt have to fight but i think my job was important in my minds eye i could see my father fixing airplanes with shiny propellers he could mend anything the electric water heater for the bathroom the truck the tractor all the different plows and reapers folks were always bringing their broken things to the farm for ray franks to fix mother told me that dad could never say no if people needed help did you go to pearl harbor my father shook his head smiling no tommy ray i went to a place called the panama canal zone theyve got palm trees down there and really pretty birds called parrots mother didnt have to fight did she the ladies stayed home and worked really hard son lots of men too the whole country went to work people planted victory gardens for their food the boys in my scout troop collected tin cans and newspapers things were scarce thats why children couldnt always have new toys why their dads or uncles had to make them blocks and doll houses my father always explained things so i could see a picture so many years later i recall that afternoon clearly this was my first appreciation of war what i learned was clear bad people started wars and americans had to go fight i already understood about cats getting run over about steers going to the slaughterhouse now i saw that whenever wars were started some boys didnt come home will i have to go fight my father stacked the trimmed boards up against the fender and sighed tommy ray i hope not but you get used to playing with those blocks i just cut because there are more bad people starting trouble again in a place called korea i think america is in for another trying time son i set my blocks in a square and then leaned forward to scratch in the dirt between my ankles fascinated by the little rustcolored bugs swarming up from the ground they looked angry like a million soldiers oh hey i yelped the bugs were crawling up my legs and biting dad he snatched me up with one arm and shook the flapping legs of my overalls tommy ray you were sitting on an anthill those little devils are red ants son theyre nasty we were at the garden spigot now and dad ran the water over my ankles it felt cool but in my mind i pictured crowds of soldiers with guns like my fathers 12gauge shotgun boiling out of the ground just like the ants that night i had my bath said my prayers and my mother tucked me in but i couldnt go to sleep right away id learned important new information out in the shade of the cottonwoods when there are wars boys go to fight mothers work hard and kids like me go without toys
