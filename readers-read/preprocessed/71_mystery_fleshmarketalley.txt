 im not supposed to be here detective inspector john rebus said not that anyone was listening knoxland was a housing scheme on the western edge of edinburgh off rebuss patch he was there because the west end guys were shorthanded he was also there because his own bosses couldnt think what to do with him it was a rainy monday afternoon and nothing about the day so far boded anything but ill for the rest of the working week rebuss old police station his happy hunting ground these past eight or so years had seen itself reorganized as a result it no longer boasted a cid office meaning rebus and his fellow detectives had been cast adrift shipped out to other stations hed ended up at gayfield square just off leith walk a cushy number according to some gayfield square was on the periphery of the elegant new town behind whose eighteenth and nineteenthcentury facades anything could be happening without those outside being any the wiser it certainly felt a long way from knoxland farther than the three factual miles it was another culture another country knoxland had been built in the 1960s apparently from papiermch and balsa wood walls so thin you could hear the neighbors cutting their toenails and smell their dinner on the stove patches of damp bloomed on its gray concrete walls graffiti had turned the place into hard knox other embellishments warned the pakis to get out while a scrawl that was probably only an hour or so old bore the legend one less what shops there were had resorted to metal grilles on windows and doors not even bothering to remove them during opening hours the place itself was contained hemmed in by divided highways to north and west the brighteyed developers had scooped out underpasses beneath the roads probably in their original drawings these had been clean welllit spaces where neighbors would stop to chat about the weather and the new curtains in the window of number 42 in reality theyd become nogo areas for everyone but the foolhardy and suicidal even in daytime rebus was forever seeing reports of bag snatchings and muggings it was probably those same brighteyed developers whod had the idea of naming the estates various highrise blocks after scottish writers and appending each with the word house serving merely to rub in that these were nothing like real houses barrie house stevenson house scott house burns house reaching skywards with all the subtlety of singledigit salutes he looked around for somewhere to deposit his halfempty coffee cup hed stopped at a bakers on gorgie road knowing that the farther from the city center he drove the less likely he would be to find anything remotely drinkable not a good choice the coffee had been scalding at first quickly turning tepid which only served to highlight its lack of anything resembling flavor there were no bins nearby no bins at all in fact the sidewalks and grass verges however were doing their best to oblige so rebus added his litter to the mosaic then straightened up and pushed his hands deep into his coat pockets he could see his breath in the air papers are going to have a field day with this someone was muttering there were a dozen figures shuffling around in the covered walkway between two of the highrise blocks the place smelled faintly of urine human or otherwise plenty of dogs in the vicinity one or two even wearing collars they would come sniffing at the entrance to the walkway until chased off by one of the uniforms crimescene tape now blocked both ends of the passage kids on bikes were craning their necks for a look police photographers were gathering evidence vying for space with the forensic team they were dressed in white overalls heads covered an anonymous gray van was parked alongside the police cars on the muddy play area outside its driver had complained to rebus that some kids had demanded money from him to keep an eye on it bloody sharks soon this driver would take the body to the mortuary where the post mortem examination would take place but already they knew they were dealing with homicide multiple stab wounds including one to the throat the trail of blood showed that the victim had been attacked ten or twelve feet farther into the passage hed probably tried to get away crawling towards the light his attacker making more lunges as he faltered and fell nothing in the pockets except some loose change another detective was saying lets hope someone knows who he is rebus didnt know who he was but he knew what he was he was a case a statistic more than that he was a story and even now the citys journalists would be scenting it for all the world like a pack sensing its quarry knoxland was not a popular estate it tended to attract only the desperate and those with no choice in the matter in the past it had been used as a dumping ground for tenants the council found hard to house elsewhere addicts and the unhinged more recently immigrants had been catapulted into its dankest least welcoming corners asylum seekers refugees people nobody really wanted to think about or have to deal with looking around rebus realized that the poor bastards must be left feeling like mice in a maze the difference being that in laboratories there were few predators while out here in the real world they were everywhere they carried knives they roamed at will they ran the streets and now they had killed another car drew up a figure emerging from it rebus knew the face steve holly local hack for a glasgow tabloid overweight and bustling hair gelled into spikes before locking his car holly tucked his laptop under his arm ready to bring it with him streetsavvy that was steve holly he nodded at rebus got anything for me rebus shook his head and holly started looking around for other more likely sources heard youd been kicked out of st leonards he said as if making conversation eyes everywhere but on rebus dont tell me theyve dumped you out here rebus knew better than to rise to it but holly was beginning to enjoy himself dumping ground just about sums this place up school of hard knocks eh holly started to light a cigarette and rebus knew he was thinking of the story hed be writing later on dreaming up punning sentences and scraps of twopenny philosophy asian bloke i heard the journalist said at last blowing smoke and offering the pack to rebus we dont know yet rebus admitted his words the price of a cigarette holly lit it for him tanskinned could be from anywhere anywhere except scotland holly said with a smile race crime though got to be only a matter of time before we had one rebus knew why he stressed the we he meant edinburgh glasgow had had at least one race murder an asylum seeker trying to live his life on one of that citys thickskinned estates stabbed to death just like the victim in front of them here who searched and studied and photographed was now being placed in a body bag there was silence during the procedure a momentary mark of respect by professionals who would thereafter get on with the job of finding the killer the bag was lifted onto a trolley then wheeled beneath the cordon and past rebus and holly you in charge holly asked quietly rebus shook his head again watching the body being loaded into the van give me a clue then who is it i should be speaking to i shouldnt even be here rebus said turning away to make for the relative safety of his car im one of the lucky ones detective sergeant siobhan clarke was thinking to herself by which she meant that she at least had been given a desk of her own john rebussenior in rank to her hadnt been so fortunate not that fortune good or bad had had anything to do with it she knew rebus saw it as a sign from on high weve no place for you time you thought of chucking it in hed be on the full police pension by now officers younger than him with fewer years on the force were throwing in their cards and readying to cash their chips hed known exactly the message the bosses had wanted him to take so had siobhan whod offered him her own desk hed refused of course said he was happy to share whatever space was available which came to mean a table by the photocopier where mugs coffee and sugar were kept the kettle was on the adjacent window ledge there was a box of copier paper under the table and a brokenbacked chair which creaked in complaint when sat upon no telephone not even a wall socket for one no computer temporary of course detective chief inspector james macrae had explained not easy trying to make space for new bodies to which rebus had responded with a smile and a shrug siobhan realizing that he darent speak rebuss own particular form of anger management bottle it all up for later the same issues of space explained why her desk was in with the detective constables there was a separate of fice for the detective sergeants who shared with the clerical assistant but no room there for siobhan or rebus the detective inspector meantime had a small office of his own between the two ah there was the rub gayfield already had a di had no need of another his name was derek starr and he was tall blond and goodlooking problem was he knew it one lunchtime hed taken siobhan for a meal at his club it was called the hallion and was a fiveminute walk away she hadnt dared ask how much it cost to join turned out hed taken rebus there too because he can had been rebuss summing up starr was on the way up and wanted both new arrivals to know it her own desk was fine she did have a computer which rebus was welcome to use whenever he liked and she had a phone across the aisle from her sat detective constable phyllida hawes theyd worked together on a couple of cases even though theyd been in different divisions siobhan was ten years hawess junior but senior to her in rank so far this hadnt seemed an issue and siobhan was hoping it would stay that way there was another dc in the room his name was colin tibbet midtwenties siobhan reckoned which made him a few years younger than her nice smile which often showed a row of smallish rounded teeth hawes had already accused her of fancying him couching it in jokey terms but only just im not in the babysnatching business siobhan had responded so you like the more mature man hawes had teased glancing in the direction of the photocopier dont be daft siobhan had said knowing she was meaning rebus at the end of a case a few months back siobhan had found herself in rebuss arms being kissed by him nobody else knew and it had never been discussed between them yet it hung over them whenever they were alone together well hung over her anyway you could never tell with john rebus phyllida hawes was walking to the photocopier now asking where di rebus had disappeared to got a call siobhan answered it was as much as she knew but the look hawes gave indicated that she thought siobhan was holding back tibbet cleared his throat theres a body been found in knoxland its just come up on the computer he tapped his screen as if to confirm this heres hoping its not a turf war siobhan nodded slowly less than a year back a drug gang had tried muscling in on the estate leading to a series of stabbings abductions and reprisals the incomers had been from northern ireland rumors of paramilitary connections most of them were in jail now not our problem is it hawes was saying one of the few things weve got going for us here no schemes like knoxland in the vicinity which was true enough gayfield square was mostly a city center operation shoplifters and troublemakers on princes street saturdaynight drunks breakins in the new town bit like a holiday for you eh siobhan hawes added with a grin st leonards had its moments siobhan was forced to agree back when the move was announced word was shed end up at hq she didnt know how that rumor had started but after a week or so it had begun to feel real but then detective chief superintendent gill templer had asked to see her and suddenly she was going to gayfield square shed tried not to feel it as a blow but that was what it had been templer herself on the other hand was bound for hq others were dispersed as far afield as balerno and east lothian a few opting for retirement only siobhan and rebus would be moving to gayfield square and just when we were getting the hang of the job rebus had complained emptying the contents of his desk drawers into a large cardboard box still look on the bright side longer lies for you in the morning true her flat was five minutes walk away no more rushhour drives through the center of town it was one of the few bonuses she could think of maybe even the only one theyd been a team at st leonards and the building had been in much better shape than the current drab edifice the cid room had been larger and brighter and here there was a she breathed in deeply through her nostrils well a smell she couldnt quite place it it wasnt body odor or the packet of cheeseandpickle sandwiches tibbet brought to work with him each day it seemed to be coming from the building itself one morning alone in the room shed even placed her nose to the walls and floor but there seemed no specific source for the smell there were even times when it vanished altogether only to reappear by degrees the radiators the insulation shed given up trying to explain it and hadnt said anything to anyone not even rebus her phone rang and she picked it up cid she said into the mouthpiece front desk here got a couple whod like a word with ds clarke siobhan frowned asked for me specifically thats right what are their names she reached for a notepad and pen mr and mrs jardine they said to tell you theyre from banehall siobhan stopped writing she knew who they were tell them ill be right there she ended the call and lifted her jacket from the back of her chair another deserter hawes said anybodyd think our company wasnt wanted col she winked at tibbet visitors to see me siobhan explained bring them in hawes invited opening her arms wide more the merrier ill see siobhan said as she left the room hawes was stabbing the photocopier button again tibbet reading something on his computer screen lips moving silently no way she was bringing the jardines in here that background odor and the mustiness and the view over the car park the jardines deserved something better me too she couldnt help thinking it was three years since shed seen them they hadnt aged well john jardines hair was almost all gone and what little was left was saltandpepper gray his wife alice had some gray in her hair too it was tied behind her making her face seem large and stern shed put on some weight and her clothes looked as if shed chosen them at random a long brown corduroy skirt with darkblue tights and green shoes checked blouse with a redchecked coat thrown over the whole john jardine had made a bit more effort suit and tie and a shirt which had seen an ironing board in recent memory he held out his hand for siobhan to take mr jardine she said still got the cats i see she plucked a couple of hairs from his lapel he gave a short nervous laugh shuffling to one side so his wife could step in and shake hands with siobhan but instead of shaking she squeezed siobhans hand and held it quite still in her own her eyes were reddened and siobhan felt there was something the woman was hoping shed read in them they tell us youre a sergeant now john jardine was saying detective sergeant yes siobhan was still holding alice jardines stare congratulations on that we went to your old place first and they told us to come here something about cid being reorganized he was rubbing his hands together as though washing them siobhan knew he was in his midforties but he looked ten years older as did his wife three years ago siobhan had suggested family therapy if theyd taken her advice it hadnt worked they were still in shock still dazed and confused and in mourning weve lost one daughter alice jardine said quietly finally releasing her grip we dont want to lose another thats why we need your help siobhan looked from wife to husband and back again she was aware that the desk sergeant was watching aware too of the peeling paint on the walls the scored graffiti and wanted posters how about a coffee she said with a smile theres a place just round the corner so that was where they went a caf which doubled as a restaurant at lunchtime a businessman was seated at one of the window tables finishing a late meal while talking into his mobile phone and sifting through paperwork in his briefcase siobhan led the couple to a booth not too near the wallmounted speakers it was instrumental music background pap to fill the silence probably meant to be vaguely italian the waiter however was one hundred percent local anythin to eat wi that his vowels were flat and nasal and there was a venerable dollop of bolognese sauce on the belly of his shortsleeved white shirt his arms were thick and showed fading tattoos of thistles and saltires just the coffees siobhan said unless she looked at the couple seated opposite her but they shook their heads the waiter headed off in the direction of the espresso machine only to be diverted by the businessman who also wanted something and obviously merited a level of service which an order of three coffees couldnt hope to match well it wasnt as if siobhan was in any great rush to return to her desk though she wasnt sure she was going to take much pleasure from the conversation ahead so how are things with you she felt obliged to ask the couple looked at each other before replying difficult mr jardine said things have been difficult yes im sure alice jardine leaned forward across the table its not tracy i mean we still miss her she lowered her eyes of course we do but its ishbel were worried about worried sick her husband added because shes gone you see and we dont know why or where mrs jardine burst into tears siobhan looked towards the businessman but he wasnt paying attention to anything other than his own existence the waiter however had paused by the espresso machine siobhan glared at him hoping hed take the hint and hurry up with their drinks john jardine had an arm around his wifes shoulders and it was this which took siobhan back three years to an almost identical scene the terraced house in the west lothian village of banehall and john jardine comforting his wife as best he knew how the house was neat and tidy a place its owners could take pride in having used the righttopurchase scheme to buy it from the local council streets of nearidentical houses all around but you could tell the ones in private ownership new doors and windows tidied gardens with new fencing and wroughtiron gates at one time banehall had thrived on coal mining but that industry was long gone and with it much of the towns spirit driving down main street for the first time siobhan had been aware of boardedup shops and for sale signs people moving slowly under the weight of carrier bags kids hanging around the war memorial aiming playful high kicks at one another john jardine worked as a delivery driver alice was on the production line at an electronics factory on the outskirts of livingston striving to do well for themselves and their two daughters but one of those daughters had been attacked during a night out in edinburgh her name was tracy shed been drinking and dancing with a gang of friends towards the end of the evening theyd piled into taxis to go to some party but tracy had been a straggler and the address of the party had slipped her mind during the wait for a cab the battery on her mobile was flat so she went back inside asked one of the lads shed been up for a dance with if hed lend her his he went outside with her started walking with her telling her the party wasnt that far started kissing her not taking no for an answer slapped her and punched her dragged her into an alley and raped her all of this siobhan had already known as shed sat in the house in banehall shed worked the case spoken with the victim and the parents the attacker hadnt been hard to find he was from banehall himself lived only three or four roads away the other side of main street tracy had known him at school his defense was fairly typical too much drink couldnt remember and shed been willing enough anyway rape always made for a tough prosecution but to siobhans relief donald cruikshank known to his friends as donny face permanently scarred by the raking of his victims fingernails had been found guilty and sentenced to five years which should have been the end of siobhans involvement with the family except that a few weeks after the trial had ended had come news of tracys suicide her life ending at nineteen years of age an overdose of pills found in her bedroom by her sister ishbel four years younger than her siobhan had visited the parents all too aware that nothing she could say would change anything but still feeling the need to say something they had been failed not so much by the system as by life itself the one thing siobhan hadnt donethe thing shed had to grit her teeth to stop herself from doingwas visit cruikshank in jail shed wanted him to feel her anger she remembered the way tracy had given evidence in court her voice fading away to nothing as the phrases stuttered out not looking at anyone almost ashamed to be there unwilling to touch the bagged exhibits her torn dress and underwear wiping silent tears away the judge had been sympathetic the defendant trying not to look shamefaced playing the role of the real victim wounded a large muslin patch covering one cheek shaking his head in disbelief raising his eyes to heaven and afterwards the verdict delivered the jury had been allowed to hear of his previous convictions two for assault one for attempted rape donny cruikshank was nineteen years old bastards got his whole life ahead of him john jardine had told siobhan as they left the cemetery alice had both arms around her surviving daughter ishbel was crying into her mothers shoulder alice looking straight ahead something dying behind her eyes the coffees came jarring siobhan back to the present she waited until the waiter had gone off to fetch the businessmans bill so tell me whats happened she said john jardine poured a sachet of sugar into his cup and started stirring ishbel left school last year we wanted her to go to college get some kind of qualification but she had her heart set on hairdressing of course you need a qualification to do that too his wife interrupted shes going parttime to the college in livingston siobhan just nodded well she was until she disappeared john jardine stated quietly when was this a week today she just upped and went we thought shed gone to work as usualshes at the salon on main street but they phoned to see if she was sick some of her clothes had gone enough to fill a backpack money cards mobile weve tried phoning it umpteen times his wife added but its always switched off have you spoken to anyone apart from me siobhan asked lifting her cup to her lips everyone we could think ofher pals old school friends the girls she worked with college alice jardine nodded theyve not seen her either we went to the police station in livingston john jardine said he was still stirring the contents of his cup showed no inclination to drink it they said shes eighteen so shes not breaking the law packed a bag so its not like she was abducted thats true im afraid there was more siobhan could have added that she saw runaways all the time that if she herself lived in banehall maybe she would run away too there hadnt been any fights at home mr jardine shook his head she was saving for a flat already making lists of the stuff shed buy for it any boyfriends there was one until a couple of months back the split was mr jardine couldnt find the word he was looking for they were still friends it was amicable siobhan suggested he smiled and nodded shed found his word for him we just want to know whats going on alice jardine said im sure you do and there are people who can help agencies who look out for people like ishbel whove left home for whatever reason siobhan realized that the words were coming too easily shed said them so many times to anxious parents alice was looking to her husband tell her what susie told you she said he nodded finally placing the spoon back on its saucer susie works with ishbel at the salon she told me shed seen ishbel getting into a flash car she thought it might be a bmw or something when was this a couple of times the car was always parked a bit farther down the street older guy driving he paused well my age at least did susie ask ishbel who he was he nodded but ishbel wouldnt say so maybe shes gone to stay with this friend of hers siobhan had finished her coffee but didnt want another but why not tell us alice asked plaintively im not sure i can help you answer that susie mentioned something else john jardine said lowering his voice still further she said this man she told us he looked a bit shady shady what she actually said was he looked like a pimp he glanced up at siobhan you know like off the films and tv sunglasses and a leather jacket flash car im not sure that gets us any further siobhan said immediately regretting the use of us tying her to their cause ishbels a real beauty alice said you know that yourself why would she just run off like that without telling us why did she keep this man a secret from us she shook her head slowly no theres got to be more to it silence fell on the table for a few moments the businessmans phone was ringing again as the waiter held the door open for him the waiter even gave a little bow either the man was a regular or a decent tip had changed hands now there were only three customers left in the place not the most thrilling prospect i cant see any way of helping you siobhan told the jardines you know i would if i could john jardine had taken his wifes hand you were very good to us siobhan sympathetic and all that we appreciated it at the time and so did ishbel thats why we thought of you he fixed her with his milky eyes weve already lost tracy ishbels all weve got left look siobhan took a deep breath i can maybe put her name into circulation see if she turns up anywhere his face softened thatd be great great is an exaggeration but ill do what i can she saw that alice jardine was about to reach out for her hand again so she started to rise from the table checking her watch as if she had some pressing appointment awaiting her at the station the waiter came over john jardine insisting on paying as they finally made to leave the waiter was nowhere to be seen siobhan pulled open the door sometimes people just need a bit of time to themselves youre sure she hadnt been having any problems husband and wife looked at each other it was alice who spoke up hes out you know back in banehall bold as brass maybe thats got something to do with it who cruikshank three years thats all he served i saw him one day when i was at the shops i had to go down a side street so i could throw up did you speak to him i wouldnt even spit on him siobhan looked to john jardine but he was shaking his head id kill him he said if i ever met him id have to kill him careful who you say that to mr jardine siobhan thought for a moment ishbel knew this knew he was out i mean whole town knew and you know what its like hairdressers are first with the gossip siobhan nodded slowly well like i said ill make a few phone calls a photo of ishbel might help mrs jardine dug in her handbag and brought out a folded sheet of paper it was a picture blown up on a sheet of eightandahalfbyeleven paper printed from a computer ishbel on a sofa a drink in her hand cheeks ruddy with alcohol thats susie from the salon next to her alice jardine said john took it at a party we had three weeks ago it was my birthday siobhan nodded ishbel had changed since shed last seen her allowed her hair to grow and dyed it blond more makeup too and a hardening around the eyes despite the grin the hint of a double chin developing the hair was centerparted it took siobhan a second to realize who she reminded her of it was tracy the long blond hair that part the blue eyeliner she looked just like her dead sister thanks she said placing the photo in her pocket siobhan checked that they were still at the same telephone number john jardine nodded we moved one street away but didnt need to change numbers of course theyd moved how could they have gone on living in that house the house where tracy had taken the overdose fifteen ishbel had been when shed found the lifeless body the sister she doted on idolized her role model ill be in touch then siobhan said turning and walking away
