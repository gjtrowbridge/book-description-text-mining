 cool revolution kate talkingtree sat meditating in a large hall that was surrounded by redwood trees although the deep shade of the trees usually kept the room quite cool today was unseasonably warm and kate with everybody else was beginning to perspire they had been meditating on and off their cushions for most of the morning beginning at fivethirty when they roused themselves at the sound of the bell from their beds when they broke from meditating inside they quietly made their way outside and into the courtyard up and down the path that led to the front door of the hall they did a walking meditation that had been taught them by a lot of different buddhist teachers some from america and some from asia it was a slow graceful meditation that she liked she enjoyed the feeling of a heel touching the earth long before a toe followed it meditating this way made her feel almost as slow as vegetation it went well with her new name a name she8217d taken earlier in the spring ever since she was small she8217d felt a wary futility about talking at the same time she realized it was something that in order for the world to understand itself at all had to be done her old last name had been nelson and for a time she8217d thought of calling herself kate nelsonfir she loved fir trees especially the magnificent towering ones that grew on the northwest coast when it was time for the dharma talk to begin kate made her way to a spot close enough to see and hear the teacher very easily he was a middleaged man of southern european descent with an ecru complexion and a shining bald head his brown eyes twinkled as he talked every once in a while he reached up and stroked the silver earring in his left ear because of the earring and because he seemed spotless in his flowing robes she mentally dubbed him mr clean she had been coming to his talks every day for more than a week and had enjoyed them very much today he was talking about the misguided notion that a 8220hot8221 revolution with guns and violence such as the ones attempted in africa cuba and the caribbean could ever succeed he seemed unaware that these revolutions had been undermined not only by their own shortcomings but also by military interference from the united states the only revolution that could possibly succeed he maintained smiling was the 8220cool8221 one introduced to the world by the lord buddha twentyfive hundred years ago something about this statement did not sit well with kate she looked at him carefully he was certainly a wellfedlooking soul she thought not many meals missed by that one except by accident quietly glancing down at the program on the floor beside her she saw he had grown up in an uppermiddleclass home had had educated and cultured people as parents and as grandparents had studied and lived in europe as well as in the east was now a prominent professor at one of the country8217s most famous universities easy enough for him to dismiss the brown and black and yellow and poor white people all over the globe who worried constantly where their next meal was coming from she thought how they would feed clothe and educate their children who if they did sit down to meditate would probably be driven up again by the lash or by military death squads or by hunger or by the list was long looking around her she noticed most of the meditators shared the teacher8217s somewhat smug wellfed look they were overwhelmingly white and middle to uppermiddleclass and had the money and leisure time to be at a retreat in fact she noted she seemed to be the only person of color there what was wrong with this picture her mind which had been clear as a reflecting pool just minutes before now became cloudy this was exactly what meditation was meant to prevent she took a deep breath labeled her thoughts 8220thinking8221 as she8217d been instructed to do if her mind wandered during meditation and settled herself more firmly on her cushion she would listen to this teacher whom she indeed respected very much and she would not be critical besides she knew what he meant there was a way in which all 8220hot8221 revolutions defeated themselves because they spawned enemies look at those crazy excubans in miami for instance who never recovered from having some of their power taken away and the endless amount of confusion pain and suffering they caused after the talk she began to think in earnest she felt she had reached an impasse on the buddhist road that evening and the next day and the next she found herself unable to meditate she kept looking out the window instead just as she had looked out of the window of the church of god and christ as a child when she had been unable to believe human beings simply by being born had sinned the redwood trees looked so restful their long branches hanging down to the earth each tree created a little house a shelter around itself just right for a human or two to sit she hadn8217t realized this before how thoughtful this was but on her very next walking meditation she slowly slowly made her way to the largest redwood tree and sat under it becoming invisible to the dozens of people who continued their walking meditation and slowly walked all around her when everybody else returned to the meditation hall she did not
