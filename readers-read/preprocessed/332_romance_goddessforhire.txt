 chapter one i never believed in dharma karma reincarnation or any of that spiritual crap which caused sort of a problem growing up because my parents are devout hindus dharma by the way means life purpose in sanskrit by the time my thirtieth birthday rolled around i still hadnt found my dharma which caused my parents some worry read anxiety loss of sleep despair handwringing tears dizzy spells and a constant mumbling of nasty things about me in hindi under their breath my birthday fell on the second saturday of january and as i zipped down pacific coast highway in my canary yellow hummer h2 i thought about upgrading to a bigger car newport beach where we live is a nicelooking beach city streets are wide cars are expensive bodies are beautiful and neighborhoods are well tended a french colonial150style roof is not allowed when the zoning laws call for spanish for your coffeedrinking pleasure there is a starbucks on every corner i like living in a place where the air is clean and neighbors hide their trash in discreet garbage cans made to blend in with the shrubbery i am however tired of the impression that blond blueeyed families are the sole inhabitants of newport beach this isnt sweden for gods sake indian people like to bitch about the big bad british ruling india for two hundred years big deal try growing up in orange county most of my cousins sport blue contact lenses and dye their hair ashblond hows that for colonial impact for the record i do not dye my dark tresses i do however highlight id spent the afternoon enjoying a manicure and pedicure at the bella salon and spa followed by shopping at south coast plaza my birthday happened to fall on a saturday but even if it hadnt my plan would have been the same one of the benefits to being unemployed eight shopping bags later i was back in my suv slurping on a mocha frappuccino im not into meditation and i dont do yoga i dont blast sitar music in my car either i prefer madonna i turned up the volume and felt my spirits rise as if it hadnt been bad enough rolling out of bed this morning knowing it was the start of my third decade the night before my aunt gayatri a gynecologist had come over to the house lugging an enormous chart of the female reproductive system by the time she was done i knew more about my vulva than i ever wanted to and that i was fast on my way to acquiring the shriveled ovaries of a crone basically my dear aunt was hinting id better find a man and reproduce then and there well duh she couldnt have been less subtle if shed hit me over the head with the pink plastic vagina she kept in the car in traditional indian culture a woman is supposed to get married and have children strictly in that order by the time shes twentyfive my female cousins and i having been born and raised in america have it considerably harder not easier were all supposed to get married have children and be either a doctor lawyer or engineer all by the time were twentyfive my female cousins all found proper careers married proper indian boys had proper indian weddings and properly lavish wedding receptions if i ever get married i definitely will not have some decrepit hindu priest muttering in sanskrit while pouring clarified butter over a fire as i struggle not to inhale great quantities of smoke praying frantically that my sari doesnt unravel fall off or burst into flames now instead of spending my birthday with people whose company i enjoyed i was on my way home to have dinner with my family the last thing i wanted to do was eat indian food and discuss recent advances in medical science hobnobbing with doctors wasnt my idea of fun if it were id be crashing ama conferences across the state my moms a pediatrician in private practice my dad a renowned urologist and i mean the man gets absolutely giddy over bladder infections my younger brother samir is in his final year at stanford medical school in fact of all the ninetyseven adult members of the mehra clan spread throughout the united states ninetysix are doctors the sole exception being yours truly thereby proving that contrary to popular belief india produces far more doctors than snake charmers i would put engineers at a close second and okay maybe snake charmers at third thereby also proving that if life were a vegetarian indian buffet id be one big steaming plate of haggis i thought fleetingly of avoiding the dinner tonight but with my mom it wasnt a request it was an order god just because i live at home and spend their money my parents think they can tell me what to do maybe it was the fact i was consuming a beverage conversing on my cell phone and steering my behemoth of a car but i failed to notice the dark blue mercedes s600 parked on the curb in front of our mediterraneanstyle house i pulled into the threecar garage left the bags in the back for later and stepped inside maya i was nearly knocked over as my aunt barreled into me now im not that tall about fivethree aunt dimple a dermatologist barely comes up to my chin in a detail that greatly puzzled me as a child aunt dimple did not have a single dimple on her face happy birthday i cant wait to tell you my surprise as i stared down at her i felt a sick malignant tumor of dread take form in my stomach tell her the news dimpy my dad smiled the queen of retina who cleared up my adolescent outbreak of acne and was responsible for the glowing complexion i possess today now stood in front of me and i wanted nothing more than for the earth to open up and swallow her plump perky form it146s hard to find an indian family without an aunt dimple aunt dimples have one hobby and one hobby only matchmaking at that moment pink plastic vagina or not i146d have given anything for my aunt gayatri
