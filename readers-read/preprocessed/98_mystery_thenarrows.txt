 spoiler warning this excerpt contains spoilers for the poet nbspnbspnbspnbsp i think maybe i only know one thing in this world one thing for sure and that is that the truth does not set you free not like i have heard it said and not like i have said myself the countless times i sat in small rooms and jail cells and urged ragged men to confess their sins to me i lied to them tricked them the truth does not salvage you or make you whole again it does not allow you to rise above the burden of lies and secrets and wounds to the heart the truths i have learned hold me down like chains in a dark room an underworld of ghosts and victims that slither around me like snakes it is a place where the truth is not something to look at or behold it is the place where evil waits where it blows its breath every breath into your mouth and nose until you cannot escape from it this is what i know the only thing nbspnbspnbspnbsp i knew this going in on the day i took the case that would take me into the narrows i knew that my lifes mission would always take me to the places where evil waits to the places where the truth that i might find would be an ugly and horrible thing and still i went without pause and still i went not being ready for the moment when evil would come from its waiting place when it would grab at me like an animal and take me down into the black water chapter one nbspnbspnbspnbsp she was in darkness floating on a black sea a starless sky above she could hear nothing and see nothing it was a perfect black moment but then rachel walling opened her eyes from the dream nbspnbspnbspnbsp she stared up at the ceiling she listened to the wind outside and heard the branches of the azaleas scratching against the window she wondered if it had been the scratching on glass or some other noise from within the house that had awakened her then her cell phone rang she wasnt startled she calmly reached to the bed table she brought the phone to her ear and was fully alert when she answered her voice showing no indication of sleep nbspnbspnbspnbsp agent walling she said nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel its cherie dei nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel knew right away that this would not be a rez call cherie dei meant quantico it had been four years since the last time rachel had been waiting nbspnbspnbspnbsp where are you rachel nbspnbspnbspnbsp im at home where do you think id be nbspnbspnbspnbsp i know you cover a lot of territory now i thought maybe you nbspnbspnbspnbsp im in rapid city cherie what is it nbspnbspnbspnbsp she answered after a long moment of silencenbsp hes resurfaced hes back nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel felt an invisible fist punch into her chest and then hold there her mind conjured memories and images bad ones she closed her eyes cherie dei didnt have to use a name rachel knew it was backus the poet had resurfaced just as they knew he would like a virulent infection that moves through the body hidden from the outside for years then breaking the skin as a reminder of its ugliness nbspnbspnbspnbsp tell me nbspnbspnbspnbsp three days ago we got something in quantico a package in the mail it contained nbspnbspnbspnbsp three days you sat on it for three nbspnbspnbspnbsp we didnt sit on anything we took our time with it it was addressed to you at behavioral sciences the mailroom brought it down to us and we had it xrayed and then we opened it carefully nbspnbspnbspnbsp what was in it nbspnbspnbspnbsp a gps reader do you know what that is rachel nbspnbspnbspnbsp a global positioning system reader rachel had encountered one on a case the previous year an abduction out in the badlands where the missing camper had marked her trail with a handheld gps they found it in her pack and traced her steps back to a camp where she had encountered a man and he had followed her they got there too late to save her but they would have never gotten there at all if it hadnt been for the gps nbspnbspnbspnbsp yes i know what it is longitude and latitude coordinates what was on it nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel sat up and brought her legs over the side of the bed she brought her free hand to her stomach and closed it like a dead flower she waited and soon cherie dei continued rachel remembered her as once being so green just an observer and learner on the go team assigned to her under the bureaus mentoring program ten years later and the cases all the cases had etched deep grooves into her voice cherie dei wasnt green anymore and she needed no mentor nbspnbspnbspnbsp the device had one waypoint in its record the mojave just inside the california border at nevada we flew out yesterday and we went to the marker weve been using gas probes in the sand late yesterday we found the first body rachel nbspnbspnbspnbsp who is it nbspnbspnbspnbsp we dont know yet its old it had been there a long time were just starting with it the excavation work is slow nbspnbspnbspnbsp you said the first body how many more are there nbspnbspnbspnbsp as of when i left the scene last we were up to four we think theres more nbspnbspnbspnbsp cause of death nbspnbspnbspnbsp too early nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel was silent as she thought about this the first questions that ran through her filters were why there and why now nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel im not calling just to tell you the point is the poet is back in play and we want you out here nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel nodded it was a given that she would go there nbspnbspnbspnbsp cherie nbspnbspnbspnbsp what nbspnbspnbspnbsp why do you think he was the one who sent the package nbspnbspnbspnbsp we dont think it we know it we got a match a little while ago on a fingerprint from the gps he replaced the batteries on it and we got a thumb off one of them robert backus its him hes back nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachel slowly opened her fist and studied her hand it was as still as a statues the dread she had felt just a moment before was changing she could admit it to herself but no one else she could feel the juice begin moving in her blood again turning it a darker red almost black she had been waiting for this call she slept every night with the cell phone near her ear yes it was part of the job the call outs but this was the only call she had truly been waiting for nbspnbspnbspnbsp you can name the waypoints dei said in the silence on the gps up to twelve characters and spaces he named this point hello rachel an exact fit i guess he still has something for you its like hes calling you out has some sort of plan nbspnbspnbspnbsp rachels memory dredged up an image of a man falling backward through glass and into darkness disappearing into the dark void nbspnbspnbspnbsp im on my way she said nbspnbspnbspnbsp were running it out of the vegas field office it will be easier to keep a blanket on it just be careful rachel we dont know what he has in mind with this you know watch your back nbspnbspnbspnbsp i will i always do nbspnbspnbspnbsp call me with the details and ill pick you up nbspnbspnbspnbsp i will she repeated nbspnbspnbspnbsp then she pushed the button that disconnected the call she reached to the bed table and turned on the light for a moment she remembered the dream the stillness of the black water and the sky above like black mirrors facing each other and her in the middle just floating chapter 6 nbspnbspnbspnbsp backus stayed at least a hundred feet behind her even in the crowded chicago airport he knew she would be on what they always called quotsix alertquot when he had been with the bureau watching her back her six and always checking for a trailer it had been tricky enough traveling with her so far the plane from south dakota had been small and less than 40 people had been on board the random assignment of seats had put him only two rows from her so close he thought he could actually smell her scentthe one beneath the perfume and the makeup the one the dogs could pick up nbspnbspnbspnbsp it was intoxicating to be so close and still such a long distance apart he wanted the whole time to turn and look back at her maybe catch a glimpse of her face between the seats see what she was doing but he didnt dare he had to bide his time he knew that good things came to those who plan carefully and then wait that was the thing the secret darkness waits all things come to the dark nbspnbspnbspnbsp he followed her through half of the american airlines terminal until she took a seat at gate k9 it was empty no travelers were waiting here no american employees were behind the gate counter waiting and ready to work the computers and check tickets but backus knew that this was only because she was early they both were early the flight to las vegas would not leave from gate k9 for another two hours he knew this because he was on the flight as well in a way he was rachel wallings guardian angel a silent escort who would be with her until she reached her final destination nbspnbspnbspnbsp he walked on by the gate careful not to be obvious about glancing at her but curious to see how she was going to pass the time waiting for the next flight he hooked the strap of his large cowhide carryon bag over his right shoulder so that if she happened to look up her eyes might be drawn to it instead of his face he wasnt worried about her recognizing him for who he was all the pain and the surgeries had taken care of that but she might recognize him from the flight from rapid city and he didnt want that he didnt want her to get suspicious nbspnbspnbspnbsp his heart jumped in his chest like a baby kicking under a blanket as he made the one furtive glance while passing by she had her head down and was reading a book it was old and worn from many readings there was a profusion of yellow postits poking out from its pages but he recognized the cover design and the title the poet she was reading about him nbspnbspnbspnbsp he hurried on by before she could sense she had a watcher and looked up he went down two more gates and into the restroom he went into a stall and carefully locked the door he hung his bag on the door hook and quickly went to work off came the cowboy hat and the vest he sat down on the toilet and took off the boots too nbspnbspnbspnbsp in five minutes backus transformed himself from a south dakota cowboy to a las vegas gambler he put on the silk clothes he put on the gold he put on the earring and the shades he clipped the gaudy chrome cell phone to his belt even though there was no one who would call him and no one he would call from the bag he took out another bag much smaller and with the figure of the mgm lion emblazoned on it nbspnbspnbspnbsp the components of his first skin were pushed into the new bag and he stepped out of the stall the strap of the mgm bag over his shoulder backus admired himself for the preparation he had taken it was the planning and attention to the small details like that that made him who he was that made him a success at his craft nbspnbspnbspnbsp he checked his look in the mirror as he walked toward the restrooms exit door he smiled he was a new man rachel would not recognize him nobody would feeling confident he unzipped the mgm bag and checked on his digital camera it was there and ready to go he decided he would take the risk and shoot some photos of rachel just some keepsakes a few secret shots he could admire and enjoy after she was gone and this was all over the narrows will be released in the usa and canada on may 3 2004 and in the uk ireland australia and new zealand on may 10 and in france on june 9
