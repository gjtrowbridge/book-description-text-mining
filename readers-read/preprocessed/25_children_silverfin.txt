james was shivering his body felt raw as if hed had the skin peeled off it like croakers eel he rubbed his arms to try to get some feeling back into them and the raised goose bumps made them feel as rough as sandpaper if it was this cold out of the water what was it going to be like in it well there was only one way to find out it was half an hour before afternoon lessons and he was standing on a low diving board at wards mead peering at the water which looked like some of codroses less appetizing soup cold soup freezingcold soup come on then he said out loud just do it he pulled back his arms took a deep breath and flung himself forward when he entered the water it was like being hit by a cricket bat he was stunned by the cold and for a moment he couldnt move but then he came alive clawed his way to the surface and gasped all his limbs were aching and his throbbing head felt numb the only way to stay in the water and stop himself from jumping out was to swim he thrashed across the mead to the other side and fought the urge to get out and run back to his room after a moments hesitation he forced himself round and swam back to the other side weak sunlight was filtering through the low cloud at least it was warmer than yesterday but these were hardly ideal swimming conditions nevertheless if he was going to stand any chance in the cup which was only three weeks away he knew that he would have to get used to it after three widths he found that his body was adjusting to the temperature and while it could never have been described as pleasant at least he knew that he was not going to die after all he swam a few more widths and when he had had just about all that he could stand he swam over to where hed left his clothes and prepared to pull himself out of the water but just as he was getting his knees up somebody put a shoe in his face and shoved him back into the mead he looked up it was george hellebore hey if it aint my old pal jimmy bond he said hello hellebore james once more tried to scramble out on to the grassy bank where do you think youre going in such a hurry said hellebore pushing him back in again to get changed always in a hurry arent you bond always got to go somewhere fast im cold and i want to get out yeah i bet you do well im in charge of the river today hellebore knelt down and gave james a big sinister smile and if you want to get out first of all you have to pass a little test james looked up into georges face his chinablue eyes were glinting with crazy amusement and there was an ugly smirk on his lips look hellebore said james holding on to the side youre not in charge here hey if i say im in charge im in charge there was no point in arguing hellebore was backed up by his usual gang of cronies wallace with his big square head and gaptoothed grin sedgepole who had an extremely small head and stickingout ears and pruitt who was rather goodlooking and elegant they leered at james daring him to try his luck what do you want said james trying not to let his teeth rattle together with the cold you fancy yourself as a bit of a swimmer do you bond said the american and bond shrugged well ive not seen anybody in this country of yours that was half as good a swimmer as me i practically grew up in the water yes said bond kicking his legs to try and keep warm youre supposed to be quite good quite good hellebore opened his eyes wide in mock amazement quite good im the best bond care to have a race not now hellebore but thats the test you have to pass bond old boy you have to win a swimming race im not racing you hellebore who said anything about racing me you couldnt beat me in a thousand years no youre not racing me hellebore whistled and a boy in swimming trunks shuffled reluctantly over from the bushes where hed been sheltering it was leo butcher a robust cheerful round boy who played in the school brass band bond had seen him puffing away at a recent concert given by the musical society in school hall hello bond he said sheepishly it was obvious that he had no more desire to be here than james hello butcher said james the deal is said hellebore you get to race butcher bond frowned butcher didnt look like much of a swimmer what was the catch what do you say bond hellebore slapped butcher hard across the shoulders and bond saw him wince with the pain a race against fatty butcher here the loser gives me hellebore paused for dramatic effect lets say their hat bond glanced at butcher who was staring at the ground it should be a fun race said hellebore but ill warn you bond butchers good hes the best the older boys laughed if its all the same to you said james id rather not hellebore suddenly grabbed james by the hair and forced his head under the surface taken by surprise james swallowed a mouthful of muddy water he came up coughing and retching you race butcher bond or me and my good friends are going to play football with your head understand hellebore grabbed him and pulled him on to the bank so whats it to be james stood up georges hands had left red marks on his arms all right he said quietly hellebore clapped his hands good fellow he said may the best man win james and butcher arranged themselves at the edge of the mead butcher was shivering madly and his knees were knocking together james wondered what threats hellebore had used to get him to cooperate are you all set hellebore called out two widths loser pays out the forfeit try as he might james couldnt understand what hellebore was up to he could beat butcher easily the blond american must be planning some kind of trick but what on your marks get set hellebore stopped suddenly butcher was caught off guard and toppled into the water hellebores pals laughed oh i forgot bond said hellebore as butcher clambered back out again one more thing james looked over at him here it came you have to stay under the water what you heard me its an underwater race as soon as you come up for air youre out of the running if you dont make it back then whoever gets the furthest is the winner james looked over at butcher who looked away hed known oh well it wasnt the end of the world james still had a chance butcher couldnt be that good and james was pretty confident that he could hold his breath for quite a while set go shouted hellebore quickly and they dived in james was ready for the coldness this time but it was worse having to swim underwater he could only see about three inches in front of him it was like trying to peer through a particularly vile greenishbrown fog indefinable scraps and dross floated past in the gloom and he thought he glimpsed a pale shape far off that could have been butcher but it was gone before he could see it clearly slimy weeds brushed against his belly and the thought of the eels waiting below in the mud made him shudder he had no idea how far hed gone but he knew that it was going to be a struggle reaching the far side let alone turning round and swimming back again he felt awful as if a cold iron cage were clamped round his head all he wanted to do was to get to the surface stick his head out and be up in the fresh air warmth and light but he resisted the urge and swam harder using a clean strong breaststroke deciding that the quicker he went the less time hed need to hold his breath however the quicker he went the more oxygen he used up and soon his lungs began to burn he struggled on the pounding in his head getting worse and worse a few more strokes and he had to let some air out then some more until his lungs were completely empty and the pain was crippling him still he battled on one more stroke another then no it was too much his whole body was crying out for oxygen he couldnt fight it any longer he bobbed to the surface and gulped in several great mouthfuls of air then he trod water panting and choking hed drifted way off course and was nowhere near the other side but where was butcher he must still be down there somewhere was he all right maybe hed got tangled in weeds no he saw his feet splashing near the far bank hed reached the other side but still he didnt come up james caught sight of him doggedly sculling back towards the start point bond forgot all about losing forgot all about the cold forgot all about the older boys jeering from the edge of the mead he marveled at butchers capacity for holding his breath it was only when he was within five or six feet of the edge that he finally floated up and took in more air although he hardly seemed out of breath at all well done butcher yelled hellebore youre a champion turtle james swam to them he was looking forward to getting warm and dry but as he reached the older boys hellebore suddenly grabbed him by the hair again and forced him back under the water he had had no time to take a breath and was soon struggling but try as he might he couldnt break free of hellebores grip and come up again the last of his air came out in a huge bubble and he swallowed a gutfull of water he mustnt panic that would only make things worse the american wasnt going to drown him he wasnt or was he a few more moments and hed be breathing in water he couldnt force himself upwards the boys arm was too strong but if he couldnt go upwards maybe he could go the other way it was drastic but it was the only solution he suddenly grabbed hold of hellebores wrist and pulled caught off guard the boy tumbled over and landed in the water with an almighty splash letting go of james in the process james quickly squirmed on to the bank and vomited up a stream of mucus and river scum hellebore was furious he yelled something and sedgepole and pruitt grabbed james he knew he was in big trouble now but anything was better than drowning hellebore clumsily scrambled out in his soaking clothes his eyes were red his blue lips pulled back from his teeth in a snarl his hair flattened to his head all traces of the handsome young boy had gone to be replaced by the features of a crazed animal you shouldnt have done that bond he rasped
