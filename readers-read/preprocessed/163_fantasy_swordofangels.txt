 varl looked troubled ldquonow that surprises me what will you tell thorin he expectsmdashrdquo a call from across the yard cut off varlrsquos words he and jazana twisted to see a horseman riding quickly toward them jazanarsquos heart leapt at the sight so beautiful in the orange glow moonlight dappled thorin as his rode playing off his armored arm glistening with unholy blackness he had come alone without a single bodyguard his smile beamed at jazana then shrank when he noticed rodrik varl varl put his pipe back in his teeth and bit down hard as thorin rode up jerking back his horse and staring at jazana she gazed up at him and for a moment could not speak he simply looked magnificent much younger with a confident vigor that hadnrsquot been in him a month ago his eyes dazzled her mesmerizing her with their magic and for the briefest moment the diamond queen felt afraid for she knew it was jadori sorcery that animated her lover born of his strange armor but then when he spoke her fear fled ldquojazanardquo he sighed ldquomy loverdquo she stepped up to him leaving varl behind staring into his strong face her hand reached out to touch him and when he lowered his own hand she grabbed it putting it to her face ldquomy loverdquo she echoed overwhelmed she tried not to weep closing her eyes against the flood of emotion from atop his snorting horse he bent to stroke her cheek ldquogreat fate how i have longed for yourdquo he whispered ldquoso beautifulyou have haunted my dreams jazanardquo ldquocome downrdquo she urged pulling his hand ldquocome inside with me nowrdquo thorin glanced around the courtyard his eyes came to rest on rodrik varl he grimaced then shook his head ldquono i want to be alone with yourdquo jazana laughed confused ldquowe are alone thorin at last we are together come down and greet me properlyrdquo her lover grinned and at first jazana did not recognize the strange look in his eyes he pulled her powerfully toward him lifting her from her feet then using his other arm to scoop her body up jazana cried in alarm then found herself looking up into thorinrsquos shadowed face and then she knew what it was in his eyesmdashstrapping unbridled lust unable to stop herself she felt her body yield to him wilting in the cradle of his grasp her arms wrapped around his neck as his head bowed to kiss her the world fell away as their lips met he held her like that for a long moment jazana trembled in his arms she saw rodrik varl watching her in shock the pipe slack in his mouth ldquowhere are you taking merdquo she asked thorin ldquoawayrdquo was all he would answer he lowered her to the saddle allowing her to sit in front of him on the beast she leaned back to nest against his chest she didnrsquot even bother waving to rodrik varl as thorin sped off spiriting out of the courtyard toward the dark gardens at once blackness blanketed her eyes she strained to see in the feeble moonlight catching glimpses of tangled vines and misshapen trees as they bounded down a narrow lane thorin moved with ease unencumbered by the darkness confident that he would not harm her jazana allowed herself to relax the cool night air struck her face and made her hair blow back against thorin he stuck his nose into it and took a deep breath smelling her lilac scent and growling ldquothorin tell me nowrdquo she goaded ldquowhere are we goingrdquo thorin laughed ldquoyou are dressed for riding my lady i am taking you for a riderdquo ldquoi have ridden all dayrdquo she cried ldquoi want to rest i want to see you thorinrdquo ldquowait my dearrdquo he crooned in her ear ldquowe shall see all of each other soonrdquo she knew what he meant and it thrilled her the sweet air made her pulse race the horse continued deeper into the gardens letting lionkeep fall far into the distance up ahead jazana spied long lines of apple trees as they neared an orchard spread out like a huge rolling blanket the perfectly spaced trees let the moonlight seep between them lighting the loamy earth at last thorin drew back the reins to stop his horse and all fell silent jazana waited hardly breathing spying their bare surroundings even in the darkness the orchard was beautiful overgrown now but still like a sliver of heaven she could feel thorinrsquos heart pounding against her back his handmdashthe one of fleshmdashtouched her neck ldquothorinrdquo ldquohushrdquo he kissed her neck nearly biting her tender skin his hard breathing reached her ear full of thirst ldquowe should get down from the horse at leastrdquo she joked her own appetites quickly rising thorin tossed himself down from the steedrsquos back then reached up and took her by the waist as she slid into his arms he led her away from the horse near the stand of trees the damp earth glistened thorin tore the cape from his shoulders and laid it over the grass then pulled her down onto it his armored hand worked her buttons snapping the threads as he pulled open her riding shirt his face thrust itself against her searching for her breasts jazanarsquos fingers clawed his back she became lost in him smothered by his strong body the cool air braced her naked skin as he peeled free her clothing his own shirt came off in a grunt of lust tossing it over his shoulder once again he fell on her for a month now jazana had craved this moment her body opened to it like a flower exhausted jazana opened her eyes for a moment she had been dreaming of drowning in cold water but it was only the rain which had begun again to fall in cool drops she felt warm in thorinrsquos embrace wrapped in his cape and sheltering arms he was already awake and turned his eyes on her his smile spoke of his satisfaction but he did not say a word the orchard remained dark jazana carr did not know how long they had slept or how many times they had made love her hair drooped over her wet face matted with rain water and bits of grass shreds of her shirt covered her shoulders and her riding trousers were soaked laying an embarrassing distance away the apple tree they lay under shielded some of the rain jazana thought she should be cold but wasnrsquot thorinrsquos body warmed her like a hearth ldquoit will be morning soonrdquo she whispered then she puzzled ldquoi thinkrdquo thorin put her head down on his chest wiry hairs tickled her cheek ldquowe can watch the sunriserdquo it seemed an absurd notion so romantic and unlike him jazana barely stirred part of her wanted to return to lionkeep to get dry or take a hot bath more powerfully though she wanted to lie with him forever at last they were alone completely without spies or bodyguards to bother them they could be silly and whisper like children to each other ldquothorin irsquom happyrdquo she said softly she kept her head on his warm chest her hand tucked beneath him ldquoi want it to be like this foreverrdquo ldquoit will be my loverdquo thorin bent to kiss her hair ldquonow that yoursquore here everything is perfectrdquo jazana hesitated she had planned to speak with him at lionkeep perhaps over supper but she would never have a better time with no one around and thorin already in a fine mood ldquoi canrsquot stayrdquo she said thorin stopped breathing for a moment then lifted himself off the ground a little she looked at him resting her chin on his shoulder ldquoyou canrsquotrdquo he asked ldquowhy notrdquo ldquotherersquos no good time to tell you this but norvor needs me thorin therersquos trouble back home and i need to be thererdquo ldquowhat trouble rebellionrdquo thorin laughed trying to ease her worry ldquoi have heard these stories already my love it is as i have told youmdashthese skirmishes happen always men are ambitiousrdquo jazana sat up to confront him pulling the wet cape over her bosom ldquono thorin itrsquos worse than you think i get reports from andola every week they say that in carlion men are following elgan now my own capital they wait for lorn to return they say i am not their queen i need to return thorin my people need to see merdquo ldquobut i need you here jazanardquo thorin said putting his hand to her face his long fingers brushed her skin ldquoyou make me strong and i need to be strong for the work aheadrdquo ldquowill you listen to me my love elgan has a movement now the loyalists to lorn are growing everyday they say i have abandoned them they call me the whorequeenrdquo thorinrsquos eyes flashed ldquothey should die for the things they say about you and they will my love all in time but for now we have liiria to secure let lord gondoir and the others deal with elgan he is nothing but a gnat and i am sure your men can deal with himrdquo ldquothey have tried thorinrdquo said jazana hopelessly ldquogondoir tells me he has carlion in control but elgan hides in the mountains around the city waiting for lorn to return andmdashrdquo ldquolorn will never return jazana he has gone to jadorrdquo jazana nodded though the story hardly comforted her it had taken time for thorin to confess this to her because he knew the news would trouble her king lorn the wicked had indeed escaped her deathtrap in norvor and had gone to jador seeking magic to save his infirm daughter he had even spent time in the library before its fall thorin himself had never encountered lorn but he had learned about him from breck and the other defenders at the library thorinrsquos own son aric among them jazana wondered if thorin was thinking of aric now ldquolorn still has powerrdquo lamented jazana now she grew chilled and nestled closer to her lover ldquothey know hersquos alive he was a tyrant and a butcher and yet they want him back and they see me here in liiria my people think i have abandoned them thorinrdquo ldquowith all your wealth all you have bought themrdquo thorin shook his head exasperated ldquoif they want lorn back then they do not deserve you my loverdquo ldquothey are my people thorin and i must keep my promise to themrdquo ldquobut you haverdquo said thorin sitting up suddenly ldquoyou have given everything to norvor you freed them from lorn ended the famine and the war and they repay you with treasonrdquo ldquono not all of themrdquo jazana corrected ldquojust some just elgan and a few othersrdquo ldquoand who is this elgan to challenge you nothing a minor noblerdquo ldquoa friend to lorn and as loyal as the day is longrdquo said jazana miserably ldquoirsquove tried to convince him but he wonrsquot have a woman govern himrdquo ldquothen hersquoll dierdquo thorin growled ldquowhen i am through here i will ride to carlion myself and smoke him out of whatever hole hersquos hiding in and then i will cut out his heart and eat itrdquo jazana leaned back against the tree the wet bark scratching her naked back it was true that elgan was only a gnat now but insects like him had a way of chewing up entire houses and in truth jazana longed to return home she missed norvor and hated what her pride had led her into it was pride that made her launch the war on liiria all to draw her beloved thorin out of hiding ldquoi donrsquot want to ignore this problem thorin irsquom not asking you to come with me but i must return to norvor myselfrdquo ldquono not yetrdquo said thorin ldquosoon thenrdquo they looked at each other thorinrsquos features grew troubled ldquonot too soon jazana i need you with me do you hear i need yourdquo she inched closer putting her arm around his neck and pulling him near ldquobecause you feel alone because yoursquore thinking of your sonrdquo ldquonordquo thorin let her kiss his forehead ldquoi do not think about aric he is with the traitors now or deadrdquo ldquoit is all right to be thinking of him thorin and i can always tell when yoursquore lying yoursquore troubled do you miss himrdquo ldquoof course i miss himrdquo thorin admitted ldquohersquos my son i thought we were finally together againrdquo for a moment the dark mask that covered his face evaporated and jazana glimpsed the old sweet man he had been ldquoi call him a traitor but i should not hersquos young he just doesnrsquot understandrdquo thorin smiled ldquoonly you understand jazana yoursquore the one who gives me strength i need strength now because my enemies are everywhererdquo ldquowhat enemiesrdquo ldquoon the border near reec king raxor has men stationed on the kryss there arenrsquot many of them yet but they grow in numbers at first i thought they meant to spy on us but i know better now they mean to invade jazana to topple us you and me bothrdquo jazana grimaced at the news ldquoyoursquore sure of this they could be defending themselves thorin in their eyes wersquore the invadersrdquo thorin shook his head ldquoraxor is cunning i know him from years ago and hersquos a man that holds a grudge he was never as peaceminded as his brother and when akeela made the treaty with karis raxor was against itrdquo ldquoas were yourdquo jazana reminded him ldquotrue because i didnrsquot trust the reecians then and i do not trust them now they mean to destroy us jazana and i will not let that happen i need troops to defeat them troops and moneyrdquo he paused looking at her straight jazana got his meaning ldquotroops and money from norvor you meanrdquo thorin smiled crookedly ldquowe cannot spread our forces too thinly my love gondoir is doing well in carlion he and manjek and the other lords can deal with norvor while you are gone elgan is hardly a threat after all but the rest of our men must remain here in koth the city needs protection and raxor must know that we are strong you see that donrsquot you jazanardquo the queen gave a grudging nod ldquoi dordquo she admitted ldquobut we cannot forget norvor thorin i must have your promise that you will deal with elgan soonrdquo ldquosoon yesrdquo thorin agreed ldquowhen this business with reec is done and liiria is secure i will ride with you to norvor and deal with elgan myselfrdquo he took her hand and kissed it ldquobut you will stay with me wonrsquot yourdquo feeling torn between the two things she loved the most it took a moment for jazana to reply she loved norvor she had fought for it for years and now that it was hers she could not let it slip away somehow though she convinced herself that thorin was right elgan was a minor noble and she had enough forces in place to deal with him ldquopromise me that norvor will not slip awayrdquo she begged ldquopromise me that lorn will never return if you promise those things i will stayrdquo baron glass naked in the darkness lay before her confident and unashamed squeezing her hand he said ldquoi promise it my lady norvor is yours and no one shall take it from you not even lorn the wicked wherever he is hidingrdquo relieved jazana leaned back again against the tree his words comforted her as did his very presence so solid she knew it would never break she spoke a soft thank you to thorin then watched as the eastern horizon began to glow with the first inklings of morning
