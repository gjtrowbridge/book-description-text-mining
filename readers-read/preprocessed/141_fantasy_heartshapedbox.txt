 jude had a private collection he had framed sketches of the seven dwarfs on the wall of his studio in between his platinum records john wayne gacy had drawn them while he was in jail and sent them to him gacy liked goldenage disney almost as much as he liked molesting little kids almost as much as he liked judes albums jude had the skull of a peasant who had been trepanned in the sixteenth century to let the demons out he kept a collection of pens jammed into the hole in the center of the cranium he had a threehundredyearold confession signed by a witch i did spake with a black dogge who sayd hee wouldst poison cows drive horses mad and sicken children for me if i wouldst let him have my soule and i sayd aye and after did give him sucke at my breast she was burned to death he had a stiff and worn noose that had been used to hang a man in england at the turn of the century aleister crowleys childhood chessboard and a snuff film of all the items in judes collection this last was the thing he felt most uncomfortable about possessing it had come to him by way of a police officer a man who had worked security at some shows in la the cop had said the video was diseased he said it with some enthusiasm jude had watched it and felt that he was right it was diseased it had also in an indirect way helped hasten the end of judes marriage still he held onto it many of the objects in his private collection of the grotesque and the bizarre were gifts sent to him by his fans it was rare for him to actually buy something for the collection himself but when danny wooten his personal assistant told him there was a ghost for sale on the internet and asked did he want to buy it jude didnt even need to think it was like going out to eat hearing the special and deciding you wanted it without even looking at the menu some impulses required no consideration dannys office occupied a relatively new addition extending from the northeastern end of judes rambling 110yearold farmhouse with its climate control officemax furniture and coffeeandcream industrial carpet the office was coolly impersonal nothing at all like the rest of the house it might have been a dentists waiting room if not for the concert posters in stainlesssteel frames one of them showed a jar crammed with staring eyeballs bloody knots of nerves dangling from the backs of them that was for the all eyes on you tour no sooner had the addition been built than jude had come to regret it he had not wanted to drive forty minutes from piecliff to a rented office in poughkeepsie to see to his business but that wouldve probably been preferable to having danny wooten right here at the house here danny and dannys work were too close when jude was in the kitchen he could hear the phones ringing in there both of the office lines going off at once sometimes and the sound was maddening to him he had not recorded an album in years had hardly worked since jerome and dizzy had died and the band with them but still the phones rang and rang he felt crowded by the steady parade of petitioners for his time and by the neverending accumulation of legal and professional demands agreements and contracts promotions and appearances the work of judas coyne incorporated which was never done always ongoing when he was home he wanted to be himself not a trademark for the most part danny stayed out of the rest of the house whatever his flaws he was protective of judes private space but danny considered him fair game if jude strayed into the office something jude did without much pleasure four or five times a day passing through the office was the fastest way to the barn and the dogs he couldve avoided danny by going out through the front door and walking all the way around the house but he refused to sneak around his own home just to avoid danny wooten besides it didnt seem possible danny could always have something to bother him with but he always did and if he didnt have anything that demanded immediate attention he wanted to talk danny was from southern california originally and there was no end to his talk he would boast to total strangers about the benefits of wheatgrass which included making your bowel movements as fragrant as a freshly mowed lawn he was thirty years old but could talk skateboarding and playstation with the pizzadelivery kid like he was fourteen danny would get confessional with airconditioner repairmen tell them how his sister had odd on heroin in her teens and how as a young man he had been the one to find his mothers body after she killed herself he was impossible to embarrass he didnt know the meaning of shy jude was coming back inside from feeding angus and bon and was halfway across dannys field of fire just beginning to think he might make it through the office unscathed when danny said hey chief check this out danny opened almost every demand for attention with just this line a statement jude had learned to dread and resent a prelude to half an hour of wasted time forms to fill out faxes to look at then danny told him someone was selling a ghost and jude forgot all about begrudging him he walked around the desk so he could look over dannys shoulder at his computer screen danny had discovered the ghost at an online auction site not ebay but one of the wannabes jude moved his gaze over the item description while danny read aloud danny wouldve cut his food for him if jude gave him the chance he had a streak of subservience that jude found frankly revolting in a man buy my stepfathers ghost danny read six weeks ago my elderly stepfather died very suddenly he was staying with us at the time he had no home of his own and traveled from relative to relative visiting for a month or two before moving on everyone was shocked by his passing especially my daughter who was very close to him no one wouldve thought he was active to the end of his life never sat in front of the tv drank a glass of orange juice every day had all his own teeth
