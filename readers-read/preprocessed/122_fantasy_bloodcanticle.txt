 excerpt blood canticle chapter 3 she drew the blood from me as if shed broken the circuit that kept me alive as if she meant to kill me a witch had me by the blood i gasped and reached with my left hand for the post of the bed and missed it falling gently back with her on the nest of flowers her hair was catching in the roses so was mine in a blatant rush i felt myself emptying my life into

clung to the post each one is unique staring down at her witchlet with glazed eyes she looked up at me the blood was on her lips just a touch and all her pain was gone and the moment had come the moment of peace from pain peace from struggle peace from fear she simply couldnt believe it in the twilight between human and vampire she breathed deeply and slowly hungry hybrid doomed hybrid her skin plumping exquisitely and the sweetness unfolding in her face as the cheeks formed and her lips filled out and the flesh around her eyes grew firm and then the breasts were rising beneath her cotton gown and a roundness came to her arms such a delectable roundness i am such a fiend and she sighed again sighed as if ecstatic looking at me yeah right im gorgeous i know and now she could endure the dark trick quinn was stunned so in love get away i pushed him back this is mine i snatched her up from the flowers vessel of my blood petals falling whispered poetry was tumbling from her

against her neck opened my mouth no power to our souls closing to each other the inevitable blindness between maker and fledgling meaning she was made couldnt read each others thoughts anymore drink

conscience dont make me laugh and so the literal dissolves she drinks and she drinks and alone i dream a suicide in a bathtub with streaming wrists i dream i saw a perfect vampire a soul unlike any other tutored in courage never looking back lifted from misery and seeking to marvel at all things without malice or lamenting i saw a graduate of the school of suffering i saw her the ghost came back tall angry oncle julien will you be my hound of heaven arms folded what do you want here do you realize what you are up against my perfect vampire does not see you go away dream go away ghost i have no time for you sorry oncle julien shes made you lose she let me go she must have i drifted when i opened my eyes mona stood beside quinn and they were both looking down on me i lay amongst the flowers and there were no thorns on the roses time had stopped and the distant commotions of the house didnt matter she was fulfilled she was the vampire in my dream she was the perfect one ophelias old poetry dropped away she was the perfect pearl caught speechless in the miracle and staring down at me wondering only what had become of me as another fledgling of mine had done long agowhen id worked the dark trick just as fiercely and just as thoroughly and just as dangerously to myself but understand that for lestat there are only temporary dangers no big deal boys and girls look at her so this was the splendid creature with whom quinn had fallen so fatally in love princess mona of the mayfairs to the very roots of her long red hair the blood had penetrated and it was full and shining and her face was oval with plumped and smiling cheeks and lips and her eyes clear of all fever those fathomless green eyes oh she was dazed by the blood vision of course and above all by the vampiric power that pervaded the cells of her entire frame but she stood resolute and quick staring at me as robust no doubt as shed ever been the hospital gown now skimpy and straining to contain her all that juicy and enticing flesh restored i brushed off the petals that clung to me i got up on my feet i was dizzy still but healing fast my mind was clouded and it was almost a nice feeling a delicious blurring of the light and warmth in the room and i had a swift profound sense of love for mona and quinn and a profound sense that wed be together for a long time just the three of us three of us quinn appeared shining and steadfast in this feverish vision of mine that had been his charm for me from the beginning of knowing him a secular crown prince of sorts full of openness and selfconfidence love would always save quinn losing aunt queen he had been sustained on the love hed felt for her the only one he had hated he had killed may i give her my blood he asked he reached out for me squeezed my shoulder and bent forward hesitantly and then kissed me how he could take his eyes off her i didnt know i smiled i was gaining my bearings oncle julien was nowhere about that i could see nowhere echoed quinn what are you saying asked the shining newborn oncle julien i saw him but i shouldnt have said it sudden shadow in her face oncle julien but he was bound to quinn said at aunt queens funeral i saw him and it was as if he was warning me it was his duty but what does it matter now dont give her your blood i said to quinn keep your minds open to each other of course youll depend on words no matter how much you read of each others thoughts but dont exchange blood too much and youll lose the mutual telepathy she reached out her arms to me i embraced her squeezed her tight marveling at the power shed already achieved i felt humbled by the blood rather than proud of any excess to which id taken the whole process i gave a little accepting laugh as i kissed her which she returned in her enchantment if any one trait in her made me a slave it was her green eyes i hadnt realized how clouded theyd been by her illness and now as i held her back i saw a sprinkling of freckles across her face and a flash of her beautiful white teeth as she smiled she was a small thing for all her magical health and restoration she brought out the tenderness in me which few people do but it was time to move out of the rhapsody much as i hated it the practical matters came to intrude okay my love i said youre going to know one last bout of pain quinn will see you through it take her into the shower quinn but first arrange some clothes for her on second thought you leave that to me ill tell jasmine she needs a pair of jeans and a shirt mona laughed almost hysterically were always subject to this mixture of the magic and the mundane i replied get used to it quinn was all seriousness and apprehension he went over to his desk punched in the intercom number for the kitchen and gave the order for the clothes to big ramona telling her to leave them right outside the door okay good all the roles of blackwood farm are played smoothly then mona stunned and dreaming asked if she might have a white dress or if there might be a white dress downstairs in aunt queens room a white dress said mona as if she were caught in some poetic net as strong as her mental pictures of drowning ophelia and is there lace quinn lace that nobody would mind if i wore quinn turned to the phone again gave the orders yes aunt queens silks make it all up everything white he said to big ramona his voice was gentle and patient you know jasmine wont wear the white dresses yes for mona if we dont use them they will all end up packed away in the attic aunt queen loved mona stop crying i know i know but mona cant go around in this disgusting hospital gown and someday fifty years from now tommy and jerome will be unpacking all those clothes and figuring what to do with it all and just bring something up here now as he turned back to us his eye fastened on mona and he stopped in his tracks as if he couldnt believe what he saw and a dreadful expression came over him as though he only just realized what had happened what wed done he murmured something about white lace i didnt want to read his mind then he came forward and took mona in his arms this mortal death ophelia it wont be much he said ill get into the stream with you ill hold you well say the poetry together and after that theres no pain theres thirst but never any pain he couldnt hold her close enough and will i always see as i see now she asked the words about the death meant nothing to her yes he said im not afraid she said she meant it but she still had no real grasp of what had been done and i knew in my heart the heart i closed off from quinn and the heart she couldnt read that she really hadnt consented to this she hadnt been able what did this mean to me why am i making such a big deal of it because id murdered her soul thats why id bound her to the earth the way we were bound and now i had to see to it that she became that vampire which id seen in my moment of intense dream and when she finally woke to what shed become she might go out of her mind what had i said of merrick the ones who reached for it went mad sooner than those who were stolen as i had been but there wasnt time for this sort of thinking theyre here she said theyre downstairs can you hear them she was alarmed and as is always the case with the new ones every emotion in her was exaggerated dont fear pretty girl i said im on to them we were talking about the rumblings from the front parlor below mayfairs on the property jasmine fretful walking to and fro little jerome trying to slide down the coiling banister quinn could hear all this too it was rowan mayfair and fr kevin mayfair the priest for the love of heaven come with an ambulance and a nurse to find her and take her back to the hospital or at least to discover whether she was alive or dead that was it i got it thats why theyd taken their time they thought that she was already dead and they were right she was
