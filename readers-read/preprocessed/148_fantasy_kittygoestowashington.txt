 chapter 1 we have beth from tampa on the line hello8221 8220hi kitty thanks for taking my call8221 8220you8217re welcome8221 8220i have a question i8217ve been wanting to ask for a long time do you think dracula is still out there8221 i leaned on the arm of my chair and stared at the microphone 8220dracula as in the book the character8221 beth from tampa sounded cheerful and earnest 8220yeah i mean he8217s got to be the bestknown vampire there is he was so powerful i can8217t really believe that van helsing and the rest of them just finished him off8221 i tried to be polite 8220actually they did it8217s just a book beth fiction they8217re characters8221 8220but you sit there week after week telling everyone that vampires and werewolves are real surely a book like this must have been based on something that really happened maybe his name wasn8217t actually dracula but bram stoker must have based him on a real vampire don8217t you think don8217t you wonder who that vampire was8221 stoker may have met a real vampire may even have based dracula on that vampire but if that vampire was still around i suspected he was in deep hiding out of embarrassment 8220even if there is a real vampire who was stoker8217s inspiration the events of the book are sheer fabrication i say this because dracula isn8217t really about vampires or vampire hunting or the undead or any of that it8217s about a lot of other things sexuality religion reverse imperialism and xenophobia but what it8217s really about is saving the world through superior office technology8221 i waited half a beat for that to sink in i loved this stuff 8220think about it they make such a big deal about their typewriters phonographs stenography8212this was like the technothriller of its day they end up solving everything because mina is really great at data entry and collating what do you think8221 8220um i think that may be a stretch8221 8220have you even read the book8221 8220um no but i8217ve seen every movie version of it8221 she ended brightly as if that would save her i suppressed a growl 8220all right which is your favorite8221 8220the one with keanu reeves8221 8220why am i not surprised8221 i clicked her off 8220moving on next caller you8217re on the air8221 8220kitty hey longtime listener firsttime caller i8217m so glad you put me on8221 8220no problem what8217s your story8221 8220well i have sort of a question do you have any idea what kind of overlap there is between lycanthropes and the furry community8221 the monitor said this guy had a question about lycanthropes and alternative lifestyles the producer screening calls was doing a good job of being vague i knew this topic would come up eventually it seemed i8217d avoided it for as long as i possibly could oh well the folks in radioland expected honesty 8220you know i8217ve hosted this show for almost a year without anyone bringing up furries thank you for destroying that last little shred of dignity i possessed8221 8220you don8217t have to be so82128221 8220look seriously i have absolutely no idea they8217re two different things8212lycanthropy is a disease furryness is a a predilection which i suppose means it8217s possible to be both and when you say furry are you talking about the people who like cartoons with bipedal foxes or are you talking about the people who dress up in animal suits to get it on maybe some of the people who call in wanting to know how to become werewolves happen to be furries and think that8217s the next logical step how many of the lycanthropes that i know are furries that8217s not something i generally ask people do you see how complicated this is8221 8220well yeah but i have to wonder if someone really believes that they were meant to be you know a different species entirely8212like the way some men really believe they were meant to be women and then go through a sex change operation8212don8217t you think it8217s reasonable that82128221 8220no no it isn8217t reasonable tell me do you think that you were meant to be a different species entirely8221 he gave a deep sigh the kind that usually preceded a dark confession the kind of thing that was a big draw for most of my audience 8220i have this recurring dream where i8217m an alpaca8221 i did a little flinch convinced i hadn8217t heard him correctly 8220excuse me8221 8220an alpaca i keep having these dreams where i8217m an alpaca i8217m in the andes high in the mountains in the next valley over are the ruins of a great incan city everything is so green8221 he might have been describing the photos in an issue of national geographic 8220and the grass tastes so lovely8221 okay that probably wasn8217t in national geographic 8220um that8217s interesting8221 8220i8217d love to travel there someday to see the andes for myself have8212have you by any chance ever met any werealpacas8221 if it weren8217t so sad i8217d have to laugh 8220no i haven8217t all the wereanimals i8217ve ever heard of are predators so i really don8217t think you8217re likely to meet a werealpaca8221 8220oh8221 he said with a sigh 8220do you think maybe i was an alpaca in a past life8221 8220honestly i don8217t know i8217m sorry i can8217t be more help i genuinely hope you find some answers to your questions someday i think traveling there is a great idea8221 seeing the world never hurt in my opinion 8220thanks for calling8221 i had no idea where the show could possibly go after that i hit a line at random 8220next caller what do you want to talk about8221 8220hi kitty yeah um thanks i8212i think i have a problem8221 he was male with a tiredsounding tenor voice i always listened closely to the ones who seemed tired their problems were usually doozies 8220then let8217s see what we can do with it what8217s wrong8221 8220it all started when these two guys moved to town a werewolf and a vampire they8217re a couple you know8221 8220these are two guys men right8221 8220right8221 8220and the problem is 8221 8220well nothing at this point but then this vampire hunter started going after the vampire i guess he8217d been hired by the vampire8217s former human servant8221 8220the vampire8217s human servant didn8217t travel with him8221 8220no he dumped her to run off with the werewolf8221 there couldn8217t possibly be more bracing i said 8220then what8221 8220 another werewolf who used to be the alpha female mate of the werewolf before he hooked up with the vampire showed up she wanted to get back together with him saying this stuff about wolves mating for life and all but he didn8217t want anything to do with her so he hired the same hunter to go after her 82128221 8220this hunter his name wasn8217t cormac by any chance was it8221 i knew a vampire and werewolf hunting cormac and this sounded like something he might do 8220no8221 phew 8220just checking8221 the story only went downhill from there just when i thought the last knot had been tied in the tangled web of this town8217s supernatural soap opera the caller added a new one finally i was able to ask 8220and what8217s your place in all this8221 he gave a massive sigh 8220i8217m the human servant of the local vampire master they make me deliver messages 8216tell them they have to leave town8217 8216tell your master we don8217t want to leave town8217 8216tell the hunter we8217ll pay him to call off the contract8217 8216tell him if he doesn8217t come back to me i8217ll kill myself8217 it never ends and all i want to know is82128221 maybe he just wanted to vent that was what i was here for maybe he wouldn8217t ask me to sort out his drama for him fingers crossed 8220yes8221 8220why can8217t we all just get along8221 oy it was one of those nights 8220that my friend is the milliondollar question you know what screw 8217em they8217re all being selfish and putting you in the middle make them deliver their own messages8221 8220i8212i can8217t do that 8221 8220yes you can they8217ve got to realize how ridiculous this all looks8221 8220well i mean yeah i8217ve told them but82128221 8220but what8221 8220i guess i8217m used to doing what i8217m told8221 8220then maybe you should learn to say no when they act surprised that you8217ve said no tell them it8217s for their own good you8217ve basically been enabling all their snotty behavior right8221 8220maybe 8221 8220because if they had to start talking to each other they might actually solve some of their problems right8221 8220or rip each other8217s throats out they8217re not exactly human remember8221 taking a deep breath and trying not to sound chronically frustrated i said 8220i may very well be the only person in the supernatural underworld who feels this way but i don8217t think that should make a difference crappy behavior is still crappy behavior and letting yourself succumb to unsavory monstrous instincts isn8217t a good excuse so stand up for yourself okay8221 8220ookay8221 he said not sounding convinced 8220call me back and let me know how it goes8221 8220thanks kitty8221 the producer gave me a warning signal waving from the other side of the booth window pointing at his watch and making a slicing motion across his throat um maybe he was trying to tell me something i sighed then leaned up to the mike 8220i8217m sorry folks but that looks like all the time we have this week i want to thank you for spending the last couple of hours with me and invite you to come back next week when i talk with the lead singer of the punk metal band plague of locusts who says their bass player is possessed by a demon and that8217s the secret of their success this is the midnight hour and i8217m kitty norville voice of the night8221 the on air sign dimmed and the show8217s closing credits which included a recording of a wolf howl8212my wolf howl8212as a backdrop played i pulled the headset off and ran my fingers through my blond hair hoping it didn8217t look too squished the producer8217s name was jim something i forgot his last name rather i didn8217t bother remembering i8217d be at a different radio station next week working with a different set of people for the better part of a year most of the show8217s run i8217d broadcast out of denver but a month ago i left town or was chased out it depended on who you talked to rather than find a new base of operations i decided to travel it kept me from getting into trouble with the locals and it made me harder to find the radio audience wouldn8217t know the difference i was in flagstaff this week i leaned on the doorway leading to the control booth and smiled a thanks to jim like a lot of guys stuck manning the control board over the graveyard shift he was impossibly young college age maybe even an intern or at most a junior associate producer of some kind he was sweating he probably hadn8217t expected to handle this many calls on a talk show that ran at midnight most of my audience stayed up late he handed me a phone handset i said into it 8220hi matt8221 matt had worked the board for the show when i was in denver these days he coached the local crew i couldn8217t do this without him 8220hey kitty it8217s a wrap looks like8221 8220was it okay8221 8220sounded great8221 8220you always say that8221 i said with a little bit of a whine 8220what can i say you8217re consistent8221 8220thanks i think8221 8220tomorrow8217s full moon right you going to be okay8221 it was nice that he remembered even nicer that he was worried about me but i didn8217t like to talk about it he was an outsider 8220yeah i have a good place all checked out8221 8220take care of yourself kitty8221 8220thanks8221 i wrapped things up at the station and went to my hotel to sleep off the rest of the night locked the door hung out the do not disturb sign couldn8217t sleep of course i8217d become nocturnal doing the show i8217d gotten used to not sleeping until dawn then waking at noon it was even easier now that i was on my own no one checked up on me no one was meeting me for lunch it was just me the road the show once a week an isolated forest somewhere once a month a lonely life my next evening was spoken for full moon nights were always spoken for i found the place a couple of days ago a remote trailhead at the end of a dirt road in the interior of a state park i could leave the car parked in a secluded turnout behind a tree real wolves didn8217t get this far south so i only had to worry about intruding on any local werewolves who might have marked out this territory i spent an afternoon walking around watching smelling giving the locals a chance to see me let them know i was here i didn8217t smell anything unexpected just the usual forest scents of deer fox rabbits good hunting here it looked like i8217d have it all to myself a couple of hours from midnight i parked the car at the far end of the trailhead where it couldn8217t be seen from the road i didn8217t want to give any hint that i was out here i didn8217t want anyone especially not the police to come snooping i didn8217t want anyone i might hurt to come within miles of me i8217d done this before this was my second full moon night alone as a rogue the first time had been uneventful except that i woke up hours before dawn hours before i was ready shivering in the cold and crying because i couldn8217t remember how i8217d gotten to be naked in the middle of the woods that never happened when i had other werewolves there to remind me my stomach felt like ice this was never going to get easier i used to have a pack of my own i8217d been surrounded by friends people i could trust to protect me a wolf wasn8217t meant to run on her own you8217ll be okay you can take care of yourself i sat in the car gripping the steering wheel and squeezed shut my eyes to keep from crying i had acquired a voice it was an inner monologue like a part of my conscience it reassured me told me i wasn8217t crazy admonished me when i was being silly convinced me i was going to be okay when i started to doubt myself the voice sounded like my best friend tj he died protecting me six weeks ago today the alpha male of our pack killed him and i had to leave denver to keep from getting killed too whenever i started to doubt i heard tj8217s voice telling me i was going to be okay his death sat strangely with me for the first week or two i thought i was handling it pretty well i was thinking straight and moving on people call that stage denial then on the highway i saw a couple on a motorcycle neither of them wore helmets her blond hair tangled in the wind and she clung to his leather jacket just like i used to ride with tj the hole that he8217d left behind gaped open and i had to pull off at the next exit because i was crying so hard after that i felt like a zombie i went through the motions of a life that wasn8217t mine this new life i had acquired felt like it had been this way forever and like it or not i had to adapt i used to have an apartment a wolf pack and a best friend but that life had vanished i locked the car put the keys in my jeans pocket and walked away from the parking lot away from the trail and into the wild the night was clear and sharp every touch of air every scent blazed clear the moon swollen bursting with light edged above the trees on the horizon it touched me i could feel the light brushing my skin gooseflesh rose on my arms inside the creature thrashed it made me feel both drunk and nauseous i8217d think i was throwing up but the wolf would burst out of me instead i kept my breathing slow and regular i8217d let her out when i wanted her out and not a second earlier the forest was silver the trees shadows fallen leaves rustled as nighttime animals foraged i ignored the noises the awareness of the life surrounding me i pulled off my tshirt felt the moonlight touch my skin i put my clothes in the hollow formed by a fallen tree and a boulder the space was big enough to sleep in when i was finished i backed away naked every pore tingling i could do this alone i8217d be safe i counted down from five8212 one came out as a wolf8217s howl
