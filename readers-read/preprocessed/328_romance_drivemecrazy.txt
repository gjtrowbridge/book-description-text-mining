sunshine on your face irsquod paid my debt but a man with a record no matter how legit he tries to be will still get a hard time from the assholes holding the jobs part of it was my look irsquod

intellectualized my appearance actually i needed them for reading my world was getting blurry when a man turns forty his body starts to change but to be honest i couldnrsquot hide what i owned a few times irsquod walked into a room and men pulled their women closer maybe because when some women saw me there was a subtle shift like somebody had struck a match down below women hadnrsquot been shit but trouble in my world my relationship with women was the same as my lovehate relationship with la the city was expensive and pretty decorated in palm trees and beaches and even with smog earthquakes road rage and endless traffic a woman that beautiful was hard to leave she heated you up in the middle of the day and with a gentle breeze she cooled you off at night married women that was another lesson irsquod learned i say that because of the scam well it was more than a simple scam scams involved confidence men who convinced you to give them their money it took days maybe even weeks before you realized yoursquod been had and it was all done with a handshake and a smile what we planned was a bona fide crime whether for selfish or personal reasons we needed money the root of all evil i lived in los angeles county the median cost of a singlefamily home was damn near four hundred thousand car registration had tripled gas prices were out of control my onebedroom apartment was in inglewood a city that had no rent control and rent had shot up thirty percent and now my rent was a little over twelve hundred a month no matter how much i hustled no matter how much money i made it

called back biters and syndicators named after a john lee hooker song the regulars just called the joint back biters an old slang term for somebody who couldnrsquot be trusted and it didnrsquot matter if the hand was black or white it was a hangout with unfinished walls decent pool tables and hard liquor no snooker or baccarat no highend shit like that a joint where candidates for three strikes made or lost their rent gambling on eight or nine ball maybe shooting craps in the back that evening i was sitting at the bar sipping a beer with my boss jason wolf jr we called him by his last name

relocated west about ten years ago and started his own thing with his windfall he was the only man to give me a chance on this side of the wall wersquod shot some eight ball then called it quits and posted up at the small bar beers on the counter chilling the night away i was reading parts of the la times looking for new words to add to my vocabulary i loved learning tendollar words like abstemious and solipsism then throwing them in a conversation and watching the stupid light come on in somebodyrsquos eyes wolf was stroking his goatee with two fingers while he struggled with the crossword puzzle both of us had on dark suits mine was italian wolfrsquos was more conservative along the brooks brothers style the poor always tried to look rich and the rich tried to look normal

downsized from his cozy sixtythousanddollarayear gig as a project engineer at northrup almost ten years ago he spent two years looking for a job and trying to feed his family off his 401k and unemployment he retrained then finally got on at boeing at a serious pay cut he was about to get downsized at boeing a nasty little deacutejagrave vu but got fired before they could kick him out something went down he went postal and beat the shit out of his manager and tried to choke him into an early grave down here people admired pedro for what he did a lot of disgruntled motherfuckers wanted to do the same to both the man and the system that was four years back with eight months of that spent on lockdown twice as long in anger management wolf ranked on pedro ldquoyoursquore as

please the wrong woman gave a man he had no idea who his wife really was i patted wolfrsquos shoulder told him ldquofive letters try honeyrdquo he thanked me it seemed like yesterday but almost six months had passed since i had crept into his office dressed in a black italian suit murder and another manrsquos fortune on my mind almost six months to the day i know because my mother had died late that same evening got the message from my brother when i was on the way to kill wolf i didnrsquot kill wolf didnrsquot have to wolf was already gone the way he spoke i could see wolf was the living

this dime piece was standing underneath a giant strohrsquos beer sign that was hanging in the doorway the room was dimly lit but there was enough light to see what she had to offer lightbrown skin

over his goatee and nodded like he understood something his barstool screeched the floor when he stood up wolf took a final sip of his beer whistled and put his suit coat back on he asked ldquoyou stayingrdquo a wave of tiredness rolled over me that was my cue i told him to hold up while i finished my beer my sinful night was about to end my peaceful tomorrow already planned he asked

told him ldquoyoursquore not irishrdquo ldquoirsquoll dye my hair red and eat lucky charmsrdquo we laughed and when the laughter died wolf called it a night headed across the room his gait shouldrsquove been confident and moneyed like he owned the world but he moved like a crab like he was cringing all the time if you stuck a cigarette in the corner of his mouth and put a trench coat on his back hersquod look like james dean strolling down the boulevard of broken dreams as soon as wolf left pedro gave me a knowing look shook his head his smile gone he told me ldquoshe just called up
