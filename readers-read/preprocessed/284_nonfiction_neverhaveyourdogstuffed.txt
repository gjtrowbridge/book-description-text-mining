 chapter 1 don8217t notice anything my mother didn8217t try to stab my father until i was six but she must have shown signs of oddness before that her detached gaze the secret smile something we were living in a tworoom apartment over the dance floor of a nightclub my father was performing in the show that played below us every night we could hear the musical numbers through the floorboards and we had heard the closing number at midnight my father should have come back from work hours ago my mother had asked me to stay up with her she was lonely we played gin rummy as the band below us played 8220brazil8221 and couples danced through the haze of booze and cigarette smoke late into the night finally he came in she jumped up furious 8220where have you been8221 she screamed even at the age of six i could understand her anger he worked with halfnaked women and came home late it wasn8217t crazy to be suspicious she told him she knew he was sleeping with someone he denied it 8220you are8221 she screamed he denied it again this time impatiently 8220you son of a bitch8221 she said she picked up a paring knife and lunged at him trying to plunge it into his face this was crazy he caught her by the wrist 8220what8217s the matter with you8221 they struggled over the knife as i pleaded with them to stop when he forced her to drop it i picked up the knife and rammed it point first into the table so it couldn8217t be used again a few weeks later the three of us were at the small table by the kitchenette eating i was playing with the knives and forks in the silverware tray i found a paring knife with a bent point and i looked up at my mother 8220remember when i stuck the knife in the table8221 8220when8221 8220when you wanted to stab daddy8221 she smiled 8220don8217t be silly i never did that i love daddy you just imagined that8221 she laughed a lighthearted but deliberate laugh i looked over at my father who looked away and said nothing i knew what i saw but i wasn8217t supposed to speak about it i didn8217t understand why i didn8217t understand how this worked yet gradually i came to learn that not speaking about things is how we operated when we would visit another family my mother was afraid i might embarrass them by calling attention to something like dust balls or carpet stains as we stood at the door waiting for them to answer our knock she would turn to me completely serious and say 8220don8217t notice anything8221 we had a strange list of things you didn8217t notice or talk about the night the country was voting on roosevelt8217s fourth term my father came back from the local schoolhouse and i asked him whom he8217d voted for 8220well8221 he said with a little smile 8220we have a secret ballot in this country8221 i didn8217t ask him again because i could see it was one of the things you don8217t talk about but i couldn8217t figure out why there was a law against telling your children how you voted one thing we never talked about was mental illness the words were never spoken between my father and me this wasn8217t the policy just in our own family at that time mental illness was more like a curse than a disease and it was shameful for the whole family to admit it existed somehow it would discredit your parents your cousins and everyone close to you you just kept quiet about it how much easier it could have been for my father and me to face her illness together to compare notes to figure out strategies instead each of us was on his own and i alternated between thinking her behavior was his fault and thinking it was mine once i learned there was such a thing as sin and i entered adolescence and came across a sin i really liked i began to be convinced that my sins actually caused her destructive episodes they appeared to coincide this wasn8217t entirely illogical because they both tended to occur every day i was convinced i held a magic wand that could damage the entire household like the earliest humans i put together my observations and came up with a picture of how things worked that was as ingenious as it was cockeyed and like the earliest people in my early days i was full of watching and figuring i was curious from the first moments8212not as a pastime but as a way to survive as i sat at the kitchen table that night looking at the paring knife with the bent point i was trying to figure out why i was supposed to not know what i knew i was already wondering why are things like this what8217s really happening here there was plenty about my world to stimulate my curiosity from my earliest days i was standing off on the side watching trying to understand a world that fascinated me it was a world of coarse jokes and laughter late into the night a world of gambling and drinking and the frequent sight of the buttocks thighs and breasts of naked women it seemed to me that the world was very interesting how could you not want to explore a place like this chapter 2 naked ladies i was three years old it was one in the morning and i was walking down the aisle of a smoky railroad car i liked the feel of the train as it lurched and roared under my feet my father was in burlesque and he and my mother and i traveled from town to town with a company of comics straight men chorus girls strippers and talking women as i moved down the aisle not much taller than the armrests i watched the card playing the dice games the drinking and joking late into the night i would fall asleep on a makeshift bed made of two train seats jammed together a few hours later my mother would wake me as the train pulled into buffalo or pittsburgh or philly i8217d sit up groggily and gaze out the window as she pulled on my woolen coat and rubbed my face where the basket weave of the cane seat had left a pink latticework on my cheek as the train crept slowly into the town i could see the water towers the factories the freight trains jockeying across the rail yards in the gray early light this would be the first sight i8217d have of every city we8217d travel to and my heart would beat with excitement and then five or six times a day8212at almost every show8212i would be standing in the wings watching there would be an opening number in which my father stood on the side of the stage and sang while chorus girls danced and showed their breasts the person who performed this job in burlesque was called with cheerful clarity 8220the tit singer8221 my father sang well and he was a handsome man when he walked down the street people sometimes mistook him for cary grant and asked for his autograph but when he was onstage as the tit singer no one looked at him after his song my father would be the straight man for a comic or there might be a sketch with a couple of comics and a talking woman a talking woman was a dancer or stripper who could also do lines when a woman was new to the company the comics would ask 8220can she talk8221 then there would be a strip the lights would go out and over the loudspeaker a voice would announce 8220the casino theater is proud to present miss fifi8221 in the pit the drummer would beat out a rhythm while she kept time with her pelvis she would slip off a piece of clothing and toss it into the wings it would land a couple of feet from me and a wardrobe mistress would pick it up and fold it carefully the stripper would walk around the stage in time to the music and finally pull off the rest of her clothing except for some fringe where her underwear would go she was naked blackout the muscle in her hip would graze my shoulder as she brushed by me she would grab a piece of her costume and hold it against her bare chest as she walked briskly up the stairs to her dressing room upstairs was where heaven was the chorus girls always brought me up to their dressing room they talked with me they patted my cheek and combed my hair they were affectionate i was like a pet when they had to change costumes they would say 8220okay allie turn your back now8221 while they changed i stood with my face against the wall where their costumes were hanging my face was buried in their silk clothes and the smell of their sweat and perfume filled my nostrils i heard the sound of their clothing sliding on and off their bodies all of this was far more interesting for a threeyearold than you might imagine but i wasn8217t only the dancers8217 pet i was a plaything for the whole company when i was six months old the comics thought it would be funny to bring me out in a high chair in a schoolroom sketch as they told me this story later all the great comics were in this sketch red buttons phil silvers rags ragland i don8217t know now if all these comics were actually in the same sketch the story must have grown with each telling they said they put a school bell in front of me on the high chair and totally by accident i would manage to bang on it every time one of them was getting to a punch line 8220you upstaged the greatest comics in burlesque8221 they told me when i was two the company was playing a theater in toronto a photographer from the toronto daily star came backstage and my father got the idea that if he posed me in a way that made me look as if i were smoking a pipe the paper would be sure to print the picture and the burlesque company would get some unusual publicity they dressed me up in my woolen suit and posed me gravely holding a pipe with tobacco in it they seem to have invented a new name for me too i was born alphonso d8217abruzzo but that day i was alphonse robert alda 8220ali8221 for short the newspaper printed the picture and ran a story under it that sixtyseven years later is a gold mine of information on how not to raise a child child of two smokes pipe once broke mother8217s nose alphonse robert alda at the age of two years and three months finds solace from worldly cares in a briar pipe i don8217t remember my mother ever telling me i had broken her nose so this may have been invented to demonstrate how big and strong i was or maybe to account for a slight bend in her nose she wasn8217t fond of as for smoking according to the myth dreamed up by my father i had reached up and taken the pipe out of his mouth a year earlier my mother was quoted as saying they8217d hoped i8217d get sick and never smoke again but that i liked it and had continued to smoke the pipe then they invented a 8220specialist8221 from new york whom they said they had consulted 8220he told us8221 my mother was quoted as saying 8220provided moderation was shown the smoking might not do ali as much harm as the psychological aspect of denying him8221 this bit of invented psychology looks even stranger when later in the article she says 8220we don8217t believe in pampering children all you have to do to stop him if he starts to cry which is seldom is to tell him not to be a baby8221 so let8217s review this you8217re two years old you watch naked women shake their tits five times a day you never get to cry or act like a baby but denying you tobacco would be psychologically unhealthy at the end of the article my mother tells the reporter how much i like to act 8220he wants to be an actor like his daddy8221 she said 8220watch ali8221 she asked 8220what would you do if a man were chasing you with a big stick8221 the little fellow spread himself against the wall his face and eyes depicting horror and fright then she changed him to a 8220funny man8221 and i switched to happy laughter then sadness when the man fell down and hurt himself the photographer took pictures of all of this and they show a surprising range of emotion the caption under them reads 8220alphonse wants to be an actor8221 it might just as accurately have read 8220alphonse wants to please8221 a couple of days later everyone at the theater made a fuss over me and showed me my picture in the paper i watched my father as he proudly held up the article and showed it around i8217d been told not to lie yet we all knew i didn8217t smoke i drank a little beer with the comics but i didn8217t smoke now here was my father proud of the gimmick he8217d come up with the picture of me holding the pipe was a clever way to announce that the company had come to town for him saying i smoked was no different from coming onstage in a sketch and saying 8220well here we are in sunny spain8221 he and the audience all knew they were actually in toronto it was just a show a way of capturing attention and if you could capture attention that was an accomplishment it was the accomplishment
