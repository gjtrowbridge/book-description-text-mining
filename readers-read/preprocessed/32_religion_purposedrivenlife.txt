 it all starts with god for everything absolutely everything above and below visible and invisible everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him colossians 1 16 msg unless you assume a god the question of lifes purpose is meaningless bertrand russell atheist its not about you the purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment your peace of mind or even your happiness its far greater than your family your career or even your wildest dreams and ambitions if you want to know why you were placed on this planet you must begin with god you were born by his purpose and for his purpose the search for the purpose of life has puzzled people for thousands of years thats because we typically begin at the wrong starting pointourselves we ask selfcentered questions like what do i want to be what should i do with my life what are my goals my ambitions my dreams for my future but focusing on ourselves will never reveal our lifes purpose the bible says it is god who directs the lives of his creatures everyones life is in his power contrary to what many popular books movies and seminars tell you you wont discover your lifes meaning by looking within yourself youve probably tried that already you didnt create yourself so there is no way you can tell yourself what you were created for if i handed you an invention you had never seen before you wouldnt know its purpose and the invention itself wouldnt be able to tell you either only the creator or the owners manual could reveal its purpose i once got lost in the mountains when i stopped to ask for directions to the campsite i was told you cant get there from here you must start from the other side of the mountain in the same way you cannot arrive at your lifes purpose by starting with a focus on yourself you must begin with god your creator you exist only because god wills that you exist you were made by god and for godand until you understand that life will never make sense it is only in god that we discover our origin our identity our meaning our purpose our significance and our destiny every other path leads to a dead end many people try to use god for their own selfactualization but that is a reversal of nature and is doomed to failure you were made for god not vice versa and life is about letting god use you for his purposes not your using him for your own purpose the bible says obsession with self in these matters is a dead end attention to god leads us out into the open into a spacious free life i have read many books that suggest ways to discover the purpose of my life all of them could be classified as selfhelp books because they approach the subject from a selfcentered viewpoint selfhelp books even christian ones usually offer the same predictable steps to finding your lifes purpose consider your dreams clarify your values set some goals figure out what you are good at aim high go for it be disciplined believe you can achieve your goals involve others never give up of course these recommendations often lead to great success you can usually succeed in reaching a goal if you put your mind to it but being successful and fulfilling your lifes purpose are not at all the same issue you could reach all your personal goals becoming a raving success by the worlds standard and still miss the purposes for which god created you you need more than selfhelp advice the bible says selfhelp is no help at all selfsacrifice is the way my way to finding yourself your true self 3 this is not a selfhelp book it is not about finding the right career achieving your dreams or planning your life it is not about how to cram more activities into an overloaded schedule actually it will teach you how to do less in lifeby focusing on what matters most it is about becoming what god created you to be how then do you discover the purpose you were created for you have only two options your first option is speculation this is what most people choose they conjecture they guess they theorize when people say ive always thought life is they mean this is the best guess i can come up with for thousands of years brilliant philosophers have discussed and speculated about the meaning of life philosophy is an important subject and has its uses but when it comes to determining the purpose of life even the wisest philosophers are just guessing dr hugh moorhead a philosophy professor at northeastern illinois university once wrote to 250 of the bestknown philosophers scientists writers and intellectuals in the world asking them what is the meaning of life he then published their responses in a book some offered their best guesses some admitted that they just made up a purpose for life and others were honest enough to say they were clueless in fact a number of famous intellectuals asked professor moorhead to write back and tell them if he discovered the purpose of life fortunately there is an alternative to speculation about the meaning and purpose of life its revelation we can turn to what god has revealed about life in his word the easiest way to discover the purpose of an invention is to ask the creator of it the same is true for discovering your lifes purpose ask god god has not left us in the dark to wonder and guess he has clearly revealed his five purposes for our lives through the bible it is our owners manual explaining why we are alive how life works what to avoid and what to expect in the future it explains what no selfhelp or philosophy book could know the bible says gods wisdom goes deep into the interior of his purposes its not the latest message but more like the oldestwhat god determined as the way to bring out his best in us 5 god is not just the starting point of your life he is the source of it to discover your purpose in life you must turn to gods word not the worlds wisdom you must build your life on eternal truths not pop psychology successmotivation or inspirational stories the bible says its in christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for long before we first heard of christ and got our hopes up he had his eye on us had designs on us for glorious living part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone 6 this verse gives us three insights into your purpose 1 you discover your identity and purpose through a relationship with jesus christ if you dont have such a relationship i will later explain how to begin one 2 god was thinking of you long before you ever thought about him his purpose for your life predates your conception he planned it before you existed without your input you may choose your career your spouse your hobbies and many other parts of your life but you dont get to choose your purpose 3 the purpose of your life fits into a much larger cosmic purpose that god has designed for eternity thats what this book is about andrei bitov a russian novelist grew up under an atheistic communist regime but god got his attention one dreary day he recalls in my twentyseventh year while riding the metro in leningrad now st petersburg i was overcome with a despair so great that life seemed to stop at once preempting the future entirely let alone any meaning suddenly all by itself a phrase appeared without god life makes no sense repeating it in astonishment i rode the phrase up like a moving staircase got out of the metro and walked into gods light you may have felt in the dark about your purpose in life congratulations youre about to walk into the light day one thinking about my purpose point to ponder its not about me verse to remember everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him colossians 1 16b msg question to consider in spite of all the advertising around me how can i remind myself that life is really about living for god not myself
