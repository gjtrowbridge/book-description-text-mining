 january 27oval officethe white house two months ago if anybody had said we were gonna catch this in the first hundred days id have thought they were high nbspnbspnbsp the fiftyeightyearold former senator from colorado and newly elected president of the united states stared out the muchphotographed bay window of the oval office and into the cutback winter rose garden nbspnbspnbsp what was it truman said nbspnbspnbsp on the desktop the blade end of his letter opener engraved with the presidential seal tapped out a rhythmic figure from the william tell overture known to americans who came of age in front of three blackandwhite channels of network tv as the theme from the lone ranger nbspnbspnbsp truman sir nbspnbspnbsp from a clubby wing chair r cabot bob winston the presidents national security adviser recognized the galloping little perididdle and made a private note to include it in his memoirs one of those little human details people liked to read about from a historic moment nbspnbspnbsp when they told him about fat boy the president clanked the blade into a decorated soup canpencil holder his youngest daughter once made him for fathers day damn it i know this nbspnbspnbsp ah january of fortyfive in this room winston sat up minutely straighter unconsciously signaling the sense of occasion he felt when past presidents were invoked within these walls nbspnbspnbsp the new president rocked in his leather chair nbspnbspnbsp with harriman and his whole sleek ivy league crowd telling poor harrythehaberdasher he had to nuke the japanese nbspnbspnbsp or not winston said in a small bow to the office nbspnbspnbsp oh i think einsteins group was the only or not the presidents dry tone glinted off the darker edge of a sense of humor familiar to his campaign staff jesus what the hell did he say nbspnbspnbsp winston searched his own mental archives nbspnbspnbsp a buttoneddown skull amp bones veteran of executivebranch politics he had experienced an extraordinary tenure having served at high levels in the nsa and on the national security council in both bush administrations his carryover appointment was both an olive branch across the aisle and a gesture of confidence toward intelligence a community beleaguered by scandal cold war excesses and spectacular failures now resurrected and seeking redemption through its mission against global terrorism nbspnbspnbsp winston their point man produced an answer nbspnbspnbsp yes wasnt it how much time do i have nbspnbspnbsp no how much time do i get the president said in harry trumans flat twang savoring the midwest inflection how much time do i get nbspnbspnbsp winston nodded composed and ramrod straight nbspnbspnbsp younger white house staffers had observed that he seemed to wear alertness like a mask as if some hardbitten mentor from the halls of spookdom had once cautioned him that blinking ones eyes was a sign of weakness and though word was passed down that the president regarded r cabot winston as a symbol of national unity many still referred to him inhouse as robobob it was cruel but fair nbspnbspnbsp well i guess thats my question too bob nbspnbspnbsp were a few days out from final testing sir nbspnbspnbsp days the presidents surprise was eloquent enough nbspnbspnbsp winston offered a thinlipped smile with a caveat which i will explain nbspnbspnbsp as if triggering a pair of explosive bolts the national security adviser loudly snapped open the bombproof briefcase handcuffed to his left wrist he then produced a file stamped project orionpotuseyes only and laid it flat on the oval office desk potus used reading glasses to inspect it as winston explained nbspnbspnbsp this is the executive order authorizing continuing funding of space shield research and testing the record enclosed represents decades of development and half a trillion dollars invested give or take each phase of publicly funded r amp d supplemented with discretionary monies by presidential eo the line for your initials has been flagged nbspnbspnbsp noting all the previous presidents initials displayed in succession the new commander in chief handled the documents like rare historical artifacts prepared for display at the smithsonian but hed have bet his campaign debt that this record would never see the light of day nbspnbspnbsp i guess star wars didnt just fade away when the wall came down he said leafing through the pages nbspnbspnbsp fortunately not sir nbspnbspnbsp classified above top secret the file in the presidents hands charted the progress of project orion from its cold war roots as part of reagans strategic defense initiative aka star wars to its post911 incarnation as a spacebased laser weapons system adroitly repositioned as a shield against rogue terrorist icbms nbspnbspnbsp ups the ante from a few missiles on the ground in alaska doesnt it nbspnbspnbsp the photon laser leapfrogs all other missile defense technology sir nbspnbspnbsp the president nodded his apprehensions intact spacebased weapons more than violated americas postabm strategic defense agreements with russia and september 11 no longer provided a free pass for whatever the us wanted in the name of national security nbspnbspnbsp so whats the damned caveat bob nbspnbspnbsp winston presented the facts unadorned like a nice neat hanging nbspnbspnbsp theres a hard window for deployment sir we have twentyone days nbspnbspnbsp thats ridiculous were still looking for the johns around here
