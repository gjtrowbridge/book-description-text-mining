 1 i don146t belong here i haven146t for years when i first came to capitol hill to work for congressman nelson cordell it was different but even mario andretti eventually gets bored driving two hundred miles an hour every single day especially when you146re going in a circle i146ve been going in circles for eight years time to finally leave the loop 147we shouldn146t be here148 i insist as i stand at the urinal 147what146re you talking about148 harris asks unzipping his fly at the urinal next to mine he has to crane his neck up to see my full lanky frame at six feet four inches i146m built like a palm tree and staring straight down at the top of his messy black hair he knows i146m agitated but as always he146s the perfect calm in the storm 147c146mon matthew no one cares about the sign out front148 he thinks i146m worried about the bathroom for once he146s wrong this may be the rest room right across from the floor of the house of representatives and it may have a sign on the door that says members only 151as in members of congress as in them as in not us 151but after all this time here i146m well aware that even the most formal members won146t stop two staffers from taking a whiz 147forget the bathroom148 i tell harris 147i146m talking about the capitol itself we don146t belong anymore i mean last week i celebrated eight years here and what do i have to show for it a shared office and a congressman who last week pressed himself up against the vice president to make sure he didn146t get cropped out of the photo for the next day146s newspaper i146m thirtytwo years old151it146s just not fun anymore148 147fun you think this is about fun matthew what would the lorax say if he heard that148 he asks motioning with his chin to the dr seuss lorax pin on the lapel of my navy blue suit as usual he knows just where the pressure points are when i started doing environmental work for congressman cordell my fiveyearold nephew gave me the pin to let me know how proud he was i am the lorax151i speak for the trees he kept saying reciting from memory the book i used to read to him my nephew146s now thirteen dr seuss is just a writer of kids146 books to him but for me even though it146s just a trinket when i look at the tiny orange lorax with the fluffy blond mustache some things still matter 147that146s right148 harris says 147the lorax always fights the good fight he speaks for the trees even when it146s not fun148 147you of all people shouldn146t start with that148 147that146s not a very lorax response148 he adds in full singsong voice 147don146t you think larue148 he says turning to the older black man who146s permanently stationed at the shoeshine chair right behind us 147never heard of the lorax148 larue responds his eyes locked on the small tv that plays cspan above the door 147always been a horton hears a who guy myself148 he looks off in the distance 147cute little elephant 148 before harris can add another mile to the guilt trip the swinging doors to the rest room bang open and a man with a gray suit and red bow tie storms inside i recognize him instantly congressman william e enemark from colorado151dean of the house and congress146s longestserving member over the years he146s seen everything from desegregation and the red scare to vietnam and watergate to lewinsky and iraq but as he hangs his jacket on the handcarved coatrack and rushes toward the wooden stall in back he doesn146t see us and as we zip up our flies harris and i barely make an attempt to see him 147that146s my point148 i whisper to harris 147what him148 he whispers back motioning to enemark146s stall 147the guy146s a living legend harris y146know how jaded we must be to let him walk by without saying hello148 147he146s going to the can 148 147you can still say hello right148 harris makes a face then motions over to larue who raises the volume on cspan whatever harris is about to say he doesn146t want it heard 147matthew i hate to break it to you but the only reason you didn146t throw him a hi congressman is because you think his environmental record is crap148 it146s hard to argue with that last year enemark was the number one recipient of campaign money from the timber oil and nuclear power industries he146d clearcut oregon hang billboards in the grand canyon and vote to pave over his own garden with baby seal skins if he thought it146d get him some cash 147but even so if i were a twentytwoyearold just out of college i still would146ve stuck my hand out for a quick hi congressman i146m telling you harris eight years is enough151the fun146s long gone148 still standing at the urinal harris stops his green eyes narrow and he studies me with that same mischievous look that once got me thrown in the back of a police car when we were undergrads at duke 147c146mon matthew this is washington dc151fun and games are being played everywhere148 he teases 147you just have to know where to find them148 before i can react his hand springs out and grabs the lorax pin from my lapel he glances at larue then over to the congressman146s jacket on the coatrack 147what146re you doing148 147cheering you up148 he promises 147trust me you146ll love it no lie148 there it is no lie harris146s favorite turn of phrase151and the first sign of guaranteed trouble i flush my urinal with my elbow harris flushes his with a fullon grip he146s never been afraid to get his hands dirty 147how much will you give me if i put it on his lapel148 he whispers holding up the lorax and moving toward enemark146s coat 147harris don146t 148 i hiss 147he146ll kill you148 147wanna bet148 there146s a hollow rumble of spinning toilet paper from within the stall enemark146s almost finished as harris shoots me a smile i reach for his arm but he sidesteps my grip with his usual perfect grace it146s how he operates in every political fight once he146s focused on a goal the man146s unstoppable 147i am the lorax matthew i speak for the trees 148 he laughs as he says the words watching him slowly tiptoe toward enemark146s jacket i can146t help but laugh with him it146s a dumb stunt but if he pulls it off i take that back harris doesn146t fail at anything that146s why at twentynine years old he was one of the youngest chiefs of staff ever hired by a senator and why at thirtyfive there146s no one151not even the older guys151who can touch him i swear he could charge for some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth lucky me old college friends get it for free 147how146s the weather look larue148 harris calls to mr shoeshine who from his seat near the tiled floor has a better view of what146s happening under the stall if it were anyone else larue would tattle and run but it isn146t anyone else it146s harris 147bright and sunny148 larue says as he ducks his head down toward the stall 147though a storm146s quickly approaching 148 harris nods a thankyou and straightens his red tie which i know he bought from the guy who sells them outside the subway as chief of staff for senator paul stevens he should be wearing something nicer but the way harris works he doesn146t need to impress 147by the way larue what happened to your mustache148 147wife didn146t like it151said it was too burt reynolds148 147i told you you can146t have the mustache and the trans am151it146s one or the other148 harris adds larue laughs and i shake my head when the founding fathers set up the government they split the legislative branch into two sides the house and the senate i146m here in the house which is in the south half of the capitol harris works in the senate which is all the way over on the north it146s a whole different world over there but somehow harris still remembers the latest update on our shoeshine guy146s facial hair i don146t know why i146m surprised unlike the monsters who walk these halls harris doesn146t talk to everyone as a political maneuver he does it because that146s his gift151as the son of a barber he146s got the gift of gab and people love him for it that146s why when he walks into a room senators casually flock around him and when he walks into the cafeteria the lunch lady gives him an extra ladle of chicken in his burrito reaching enemark146s gray suit jacket harris pulls it from the coatrack and fishes for the lapel the toilet flushes behind us we all spin back toward the stall harris is still holding the jacket before any of us can react the door to the stall swings open if we were brandnew staffers this is where we146d panic instead i bite the inside of my cheek and take a deep gulp of harris146s calm old instincts kick in as the door to the stall opens i go to step in front of the congressman all i have to do is buy harris a few seconds the only problem is enemark146s moving too quickly sidestepping me without even looking up enemark is someone who avoids people for a living leaving the stall he heads straight for the coatrack if harris is caught with his jacket 147congressman 148 i call out he doesn146t slow down i turn to follow but just as i spin around i146m surprised to see enemark146s gray coat hanging lifelessly on the coatrack there146s a sound of running water on the right side of the room harris is washing his hands by the sink across from him larue rests his chin in his palm studying cspan with his fingers covering his mouth see no evil hear no evil speak no evil 147excuse me148 enemark asks taking his coat from the rack the way it146s draped over his forearm i can146t see the lapel the pin146s nowhere in sight i glance over at harris who146s wearing a calm that146s almost hypnotic his green eyes disappear in a soft squint and his dark black eyebrows seem to take over his face japanese is easier to read 147son did you say something148 enemark repeats 147we just wanted to say hello sir148 harris interrupts leaping to my aid 147really it146s an honor to meet you isn146t that right matthew148 147aabsolutely148 i say enemark146s chest rises at the compliment 147much appreciated148 147i146m harris harris sandler 148 he says introducing himself even though enemark didn146t ask leaving the sink harris studies the congressman like a chessboard it146s the only way to stay ten moves ahead the congressman extends a handshake but harris pulls away 147sorry wet hands 148 he explains 147by the way congressman this is matthew mercer he does interior approps for congressman cordell148 147sorry to hear that148 enemark jabs with a fake laugh as he pumps my hand asshole without another word he opens his coat and slides an arm into the sleeve i check the lapel there146s nothing there 147have a good day sir148 harris says as enemark slides his other arm in enemark rotates his shoulder blades and pulls his suit jacket into place when the other half of the jacket hits his chest a tiny flash of light catches my eye there on his other lapel there146s a tiny american flag pin a little triangle with an oil well on it and the lorax whose big dr seuss eyes smile at me i motion to harris he looks up and finally grins when i was a freshman at duke harris was a senior he got me into the fraternity and years later got me my first job here on the hill mentor then hero now 147look at that148 harris says to the congressman 147i see you146re wearing the logging mascot148 i turn toward larue but he146s staring at the ground to keep himself from laughing 147yeah i guess148 enemark barks checking the lorax out for himself anxious to be done with the small talk the congressman leaves the bathroom and heads across the hallway to the house floor none of us moves until the door closes 147the logging mascot148 i finally blurt 147i told you there146s still fun going on148 harris says looking up at the small tv and checking out cspan just another day at work 147i gotta tell rosey this one 148 larue says rushing out of the room 147harris they146re gonna catch you sooner or later148 147only if they outthink us148 harris replies as the door again slams shut i continue to laugh harris continues to study cspan 147you notice enemark didn146t wash his hands148 he asks 147though that didn146t stop him from shaking yours148 i look down at my own open palm and head for the sink 147here we go here146s the clip for the highlight reel 148 harris calls out pointing up at cspan onscreen congressman enemark approaches the podium with his usual oldcowboy swagger but if you look real close151when the light hits him just right151the lorax shines like a tiny star on his chest 147i146m congressman william enemark and i speak for the people of colorado148 he announces through the television 147that146s funny148 i say 147i thought he spoke for the trees 148 to my surprise harris doesn146t smile he just scratches at the dimple in his chin 147feeling better148 he asks 147of course151why148 he leans against the inlaid mahogany wall and never takes his eyes off the tv 147i meant what i said before there really are some great games being played here148 147you mean games like this148 147something like this148 there146s a brandnew tone in his voice all serious 147i don146t understand148 147oh jeez matthew it146s right in front of your face148 he says with a rare glimpse of rural pennsylvania accent i give him a long hard look and rub the back of my sandyblond hair i146m a full head taller than him but he146s still the only person i look up to in this place 147what146re you saying harris148 147you wanted to bring the fun back right148 147depends what kinda fun you146re talking about148 pushing himself off the wall harris grins and heads for the door 147trust me it146ll be more fun than you146ve had in your entire life no lie148
