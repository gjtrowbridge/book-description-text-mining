 chapter one quotsift the sand to find the seeds of the universequot the voice that came to shan tao yuri through the night was like wind over grass quotlet them reach the original ground then plant themquot the lama said as shans gaze drifted from the white sand in his palm to the brilliant half moon he knew his teacher gendun meant shans original ground the seedbed of his soul what gendun called shans beginning place but on such a night he could not shake the sense that tibet itself was the true original ground that the vast remote land was the worlds beginning place where the planet and humankind never stopped shaping themselves where the highest mountains the strongest winds and the most rugged souls had always evolved together ten feet farther down the rivers edge shans old friend and former cellmate lokesh chanted quietly beads entwined in his fingers his mantra almost indistinguishable from the rustle of the water shan breathed in the fragrant smoke of the juniper branches they had brought to burn at the waters edge and watched as a meteor flew over a low distant shimmering in the sky the only hint of the snowcapped mountains that lined the horizon it seemed he could reach out and touch the moon if the earth had a place and a season for growing souls this was surely it the chill moonlit spring of the high tibetan wilderness shan watched as though from a distance as gendun gently opened shans fingers and lifted his hand toward the moon then lowered it and turned shans wrist to empty the sand into the small clay jar they had brought from their hermitage ten miles away quotlha gyal loquot a voice murmured on shans opposite side it was the caretaker of the hermitage shopo his voice cracking with emotion quotvictory to the godsquot they had arrived at the river at dusk and only now after the lamas and lokesh had spent two hours speaking with the nagas the water deities had gendun decided shan could begin collecting the special white sand quotlha gyal loquot an excited voice echoed halfway up the slope behind them it was one of the four dropka tibetan herders who had escorted them to the river and now stood guard nervously watching the darkened landscape gendun and shopo were outlawed monks engaged in an outlawed ritual and the patrols had grown aggressive without even sensing the movement shan found his hand back in the water and when he lifted it out it was full of the white sand again in the moonlight he saw lokeshs eyes widen and gleam with excitement as slowly repeating the motions gendun had shown him shan washed the sand in the moonlight then emptied his palm into the jar genduns face worn smooth as a river stone wrinkled with a smile quoteach of the grains is the essence of a mountainquot the lama said as shans hand dipped into the water once more quotall that is left when the mountain has shed its huskquot shan had heard the words a dozen times during the past two months as they had ventured into the night to collect sands from places known only to shopo and the herders in their turn each of the vast peaks that lined the horizon would be reduced to such a grain gendun explained and so it would be for all mountains all continents all planets it would all end as it began in such tiny seeds and humankind in all its glory could never match the power reflected in a single grain the words were a way of teaching impermanence shan knew and of showing respect for the nagas from whom they borrowed the sand shan sensed a distant drumming noise in his ears and the moon seemed to edge even closer as he gathered another handful for the jar his hand reached toward the clay jar then froze in midair as a frantic voice split the stillness quot mik tada watch out runquot it was one of the dropka sentinels on the ridge above quotthe fire dowse the firequot shan heard feet scrambling over the gravel of the slope above and looked up to see two men silhouetted in the moonlight realizing in the same moment that the drumming was not in his head it was a helicopter coming in low and fast the way public security operated when raiding tibetan camps one of the guards wearing a black wool cap darted to the waters edge futilely pulling on lokeshs shoulder then moving to shans side to tug on his collar quotyou have to go patch that godquot the man shouted quotwe must fleequot shan let himself be pulled to his feet his spine chilling as he looked first toward the helicopter then at the lamas who only smiled and continued their homage to the river gendun and shopo were accustomed to risking imprisonment for simple acts of reverence and though shan and the dropka might be disturbed by the increased pressure from public security there was only one mystery that ever concerned gendun the mystery of growing and strengthening souls quotif it is public security they will drop soldiers over the ridge to surround usquot the sentinel groaned as he kicked sticks from the small fire quotthey will have machine guns and devices to see in the nightquot shan studied the man in the black cap warily he had more than a mere herders grasp of chinese weapons and tactics shan suddenly realized that he had not seen the man before that he had not been part of their escort gendun replied by raising a finger to his lips then gestured toward the water quotthere are nagasquot he observed quietly quotthe sand will be useless if you are arrestedquot shan whispered his hand on genduns shoulder quotthere are nagasquot the lama repeated quotits only sandquot the stranger argued casting a tormented glance in the direction of the approaching helicopter public security had its own ways of teaching impermanence as gendun turned back to the water lokesh was suddenly at the strangers side pulling him away from the lama quotwe are creating something wonderful with that sandquot shans old friend whispered the white stubble of his whiskers glistening in the moonlight he placed his hands on the mans shoulders to be sure the young tibetan was listening and gazed into his face quotwhen we are donequot he explained in a solemn confiding tone quotit will change the worldquot the man in the black cap illuminated an electric lantern and aimed the beam into lokeshs face as if doubting he had heard the old tibetan correctly then as the sound of the helicopter surged to a crescendo he snapped off the light and dove to the ground a moment later the machine was gone it had skimmed the ridge above but had been traveling too fast to deploy troops the man in the cap lit his lantern and muttered under his breath casting an accusing glance at the other guards who had gathered behind lokesh with sheepish even embarrassed expressions he aimed the light beam into each mans face settling it on shans which he studied with a frown quotyou are supposed to be delivering an artifactquot he said to lokesh his voice heavy with impatience he did not move the light from shan quotwe arequot lokesh agreed quotwe are preparing for the journeyquot he added with a gesture toward the two lamas who continued to speak over the swift dark river quotpreparingquot the man scoffed quotwhat have you been doing for two months youre not preparing youre taking root you will ruin usquot shan stepped beside lokesh and pushed the mans lantern down quotthose who brought the artifact agreed that the lamas will decide the proper way to return itquot he knew now the stranger like those who had brought the sacred artifact to shopos hermitage was a purba a member of the secret tibetan resistance quotyou mean drakte agreedquot quotdrakte is one of youquot shan asserted he and lokesh had met drakte nearly a year earlier aiding prisoners in the gulag camp where they had served it had been drakte who had intercepted them two months ago and taken them to shopos hidden hermitage quotwe will go when the lamas and drakte are ready he is coming to show us the way a few more days at mostquot quotwe dont have a few more daysquot the purba groused quotand dont expect drakte hes not keeping his appointmentsquot quotmissingquot shan noticed a bulge under the mans jacket at the waist and looked back at gendun if the lamas thought the man had a gun they would insist he leave the purba shrugged quotnot where he was asked to bequot quotand youve come in his placequot quotno but i was hoping to find him at that hermitage there is news and i brought something he had asked forquot he added in a peevish tone quothe said the lamas needed it he said if we did not agree to retrieve it he would go himself all the way to india if necessaryquot the purba lowered a long narrow sack from his shoulder and produced an eighteeninchlong bamboo tube which lokesh eagerly accepted quotwhat newsquot shan asked before he replied the man pointed to one of the herders then to the top of the hill where the guards had been watching the road beyond the herder sprang up the slope quota man was killed an official in amdo townquot he said referring to the closest settlement of any size nearly a hundred miles away quotpublic security will sweep the hills and detain people when they interrogate they will learn of the hermitagequot he cast another frown toward the lamas quotyou may call it sacred what you are doing but they will call it a crime against the statequot he took a step toward gendun as though to try again to drag him away but a herder in a fleece vest stepped forward with a hand raised in warning quotdo you have any idea how dangerous this isquot the purbas hands clenched and unclenched repeatedly he seemed ready to do battle with them quotno one told us you would wander around the mountains like this you could go to prison all of you for what you cant fight the chinese with sand and prayersquot lokesh uttered a hoarse sound that shan recognized as a laugh quoti have known chinese prisonsquot the old tibetan said quotsometimes sand and prayers are the only wayquot the purba fixed shan with a bitter stare quotyou are the famous chinese who fixes things for tibetans you know better but still you let them do thisquot shan paused to study gendun and shopo quotif these lamas asked me to jump into this river with my pockets stuffed with rocksquot he said quietly quoti would thank them and leap inquot quotllia gyal loquot the herder in the vest whispered as if to cheer shan on lokesh touched the warriors arm quotit is difficult for one so young to understand these thingsquot the old tibetan said quotyou should return with us to the hermitage and seequot 8220unlike drakte i obey my ordersquot the man snapped quoti am needed elsewhere8221 lokesh raised the bamboo tube in his hand quotthen look nowquot he suggested extracting a roll of cloth from the tube as lokesh straightened it shan saw that it was an old thangka one of the cloth paintings used to depict the icons of tibetan buddhism when the purbas light hit the painting the man grimaced and retreated a step one of the dropka guards moaned loudly it was the image of a fierce demon with the head of a bull garlanded with human skulls surrounded by swords and spears and arrows holding a cup of blood the flayed skins of its victims lay at its feet lokesh studied the image with a satisfied grin then motioned the purba forward quotlook carefullyquot the old tibetan said pointing to the head of the terrifying image quotthis is what we are doing this is how we win without violence this is how the artifact will be returned how that deity is going to be repaired because this is what he is becomingquot quotwhoquot the purba asked the anger in his voice now tinged with confusion in the dim light shan thought he saw surprise on lokeshs face as though the answer were obvious then lokesh gestured from the skullclad demon to shan quotour friend our shanquot the spell cast by the words silenced the purba and the dropka all of whom stared uneasily at shan shan searched lokeshs face for an explanation but his friend just grinned back expectantly as if he had given shan a great gift suddenly another desperate cry split the air the guard at the top of the ridge frantically stumbled down the slope quota patrol knobsquot he cried meaning the soldiers of the public security bureau the purba and shan leapt up and moments later gazed down at a troop transport half a mile away edging its way slowly toward their position quotthat helicopter spotted usquot the purba said quotlast month they used infrared to find an old hermit who only came out at night to prayquot shan sensed the fierce determination rising in the warriors voice and shuddered at the river three of the dropka were in a cluster around the lamas facing outward as if preparing to engage the knobs with their staffs the fourth the man wearing the fleece vest stood apart staring into the black water as the purba marched purposefully toward the lamas the herder in the vest spun about and hurled himself on the purba shoving him to the ground then just as abruptly pulling away in his hand was a large automatic pistol quotyou foolquot the purba spat quotthey have to be taken away we cant fight those knobsquot shame crossed the herders face as he looked at the pistol in his hand and he held the weapon clumsily fingers around only the grip not touching the trigger quotyou see that onequot he said nodding toward gendun who still communed with the river quotmy mother stays at that tent by the hermitage she calls him the pure water lama you know why not just because he never registered with the bastards at the bureau of religious affairs but because he took his vows more than fifty years ago before the invasion before the chinese scoured our land and changed it forever he has never gone into exile never been captured his words are uncontaminated my mother says because they flow from a stream the chinese never discoveredquot the man spoke slowly with a tone of wonder as if he had forgotten the knob patrol beside him two of the herders knelt at the river and began collecting pebbles quoti need my gunquot growled the purba still sprawled on the ground he was scared shan saw sometimes traditional tibetans hated the purbas as much as the chinese quotwe need to get them out of herequot the herder shook his head quoti have never done anything with my lifequot he said in a hollow voice quotthe chinese would not let me go to school they wouldnt let me travel they wouldnt let me get a job im like a little stunted tree that can never grow and that one the pure water lama he is like the towering survivor of a forest where everything else was leveledquot he cast a smile toward gendun then looked at the purba his face hardening quothere is how we protect such menquot he said and he threw the gun into the black water the two herders at the rivers edge rose and stepped to his side pulling slings from their pockets quotwe have heard how to do this from others we will smash their searchlights and fill the air with stones if we are lucky they will not see us chinese soldiers get scared in the night they hear stories of demonsquot he glanced at the thangka still in lokeshs hand then at shan quotthe lamas must fill the jarquot he said to the purba quotand then you will take them back my younger brother knows the wayquot he said gesturing toward the remaining herder quotif we do not stop the patrol you are the one who best knows how to evade the soldiersquot when the man lifted his sling his hand shook quotpatch the deityquot he said in a rushed whisper to shan then faded into the shadows with his companions as shan helped the purba to his feet the man looked into the darkness in the direction the herders had gone a mixture of anger and awe on his face quotthat artifactquot he said in a hollow voice quoti hear its just a little piece of stonequot
