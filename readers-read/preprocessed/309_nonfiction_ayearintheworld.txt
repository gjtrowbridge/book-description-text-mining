right toward the new im for the newno mournful backward glance make tracks i write one night on the steamed kitchen window the year began with a breakin at my house while my husband and i were finishing dinner ed had just tipped the last of a vino nobile into our glasses laughing we were talking about the turn of the year with nina simone crooning quotthe twelfth of neverquot to us wed cleared the plates the candles were burning down and outside the dining room window we saw only our potted lemon trees swaying snapdragons and yellow carolina jasmine for january in california is a blessed season in a flash everything changed a man crashed through the living room window screaming that he wanted to die then loomed on the middle of the rug his bundled body in ski jacket droopy pants and homeboy hat pulled down around his moony face even as i write this my heart starts to pound quotgive me a knifequot he shouted quotive never done this before but im doing it nowquot i thought not does he have a gun will we die but hes goofy then terror pumped through every vein in my body t his cant be happening somehow wed stood up run my chair tipped over he lunged into the dining room i threw my glass of wine in his face and as he wiped his eyes we ran out the back door quoti want to diequot he shouted to us as we fled into a street darkened by conscientious neighbors in the middle of the latest corruptionengineered energy crisis our house was blazing like the titanic lights flared in every window our intruder had been drawn to us like a fluttering moth toward the screen door on a soft southern night ed grabbed a phone on the way out and somehow called 911 as he sprinted across the street we ran to separate neighbors hoping to find someone at home on saturday night startled new chinese neighbors brought me in and handed me the telephone though they must have thought i was mad while the intruder followed ed across the street to our neighbors arlene and dan interrupted in the middle of a dinner party they pulled ed in and slammed the door then our intruder broke through their doorjust as the police drove up that was the beginning the drugged young man was on the street again in a month i found his sunglasses in a flower bed expensive i threw them in the trash the year rolled on and doesnt bear thinking about suffice to say the words surgery hospitals deaths as the sublime september weather arrived we all experienced the mindaltering worldshaking attack on america go bad year may the stars realign now janus my friend i am going to spain for a winter month in andaluc237a andaluc237a land of the orange and the olive tree land of passionate poets and flamenco dancers and latenight dinners with guitar music in jasminescented gardens ed flew to italy a week ago because as always we have some complicated building project in progress en route to spain he has detoured to bramasole our house in cortona to see about the drilling of a well for a ninehundredyearold house we have bought in the mountains we want to accomplish a historic restoration on this stone house built by hermit monks who followed saint francis of assisi when i last talked to him the dowser had felt his stick bend in exactly the spot where i did not want a well and had drilled down a hundred meters without finding a drop we are planning to meet in madrid from san francisco i board a flight to paris and am happy to see my seatmate take out a book instead of a computer no white aura and taptapping for the tenhour flight she looks as if she could have been one of my colleagues at the university is she going to europe to research a fresco cycle or to join an archaeological team at a roman villa excavation i take out my own book ready to escape into silence for the duration she smiles and asks quotwhat are you readingquot quota biography of federico garc237a lorcagetting ready for spain what are you readingquot quotoh a book on john three thirteenquot quotthree thirteen i dont know that verse we used to sing john three sixteen john three sixteen in rounds at methodist sunday schoolquot the flight attendant comes by with champagne and orange juice quotjust waterquot my seatmate and i say in unison we begin to talk about travel and books chatting easily though i am at first waiting for a chance to retreat we know nothing of each other and will part when the scramble to exit at charles de gaulle begins she asks a lot of questions i tell her i am a former university teacher now a fulltime writer i tell her about living part of the year in italy and that italy has given me several books written with joy she probes are my books published are they popular and if so do i know why what do i try to accomplish with my writing how do i feel about peoples responses to my books on and on i tell her that im embarking on the first of many travels and that i hope to write a book about my experiences why what will i be looking for i am drawn into lengthy explanations i say im interested in the idea and fact of home im going to places where i have dreamed of living and will try to settle down in each read the literature look at the gardens shop for whats in season try to feel at home im talking more openly than usual with a stranger is she a psychiatrist quotand youve never felt gods hand on yoursquot she looks quizzically at me quotno ive felt lucky thoughquot quotmaybe you are bringing happiness to people through the will of god maybequot she smiles she answers my own questions evasively she is holding something back even in the basic exchanges such as whether she is on vacation that simple opening into conversation our little equation is out of balance finally i ask bluntly quotwhat do you doquot quoti i guess you could say im a speakerquot quoton what subjectsquot silence she is gazing out the window she is a very still person quotim part of a foundation we try to help in communities with severe problemsquot vague she sees my questioning look she frowns quotwere involved in education and orphanages and churchesquot quotoh so its a religious foundation what religion are youquot i assume she is a presbyterian or methodist a good volunteer for good works or is involved in catholic charities quoti know this is strange but i have a strong sense about you ill just tell you my journeyquot she then describes the surprise of her conversion her subsequent adoption of six children from all over the world her work in africa and russia her husband a prominent lawyer eventually had his own revelation and joins her in her missions dinner is served and we talk on quotyouve probably never met anyone like me anyone who hears the voice of godquot quoti think i havent you hear the voice of godquot oh mamma mia i think quotyes hes talking to me right now all the timequot quotwhat does he sound likequot i wonder if she is speaking metaphorically living out a grand as if she laughs quothes funny sometimes sometimes we dance hes telling me about you but i dont want you to think im a psychic with a neon sign in the windowquot i start to ask sarcastically if he is a good dancer and what kind of dances he leads her inrhumba but i dont as a doubter with strong spiritual interests im tantalized by her big holy spirit visitations i imagine it feels like a mewling kitten being lifted in the jaws of an enormous mother cat and taken to safety im ready myself but have never felt the slightest inkling that anything out there in the void is the least bit interested in the hairs on my head or the feathers of small sparrows quotif god is talking about me id like to hear what he says because ive never heard from him before tonightquot wheres the flight attendant id like a big glass of wine this is getting surreal im thirtyfive thousand feet above terra firma with someone who dances with god quotwell i will tell you that he says you have the gift of divine humility how did you get that its so rarequot quotmaybe its a lack of confidencequot quotno ive seen it in one priest someone i consulted when i felt the urge to prophesyquot whoa prophesy quotoh youre a prophetquot i toss this off casually as though it were oh youre from memphis she looks out the window sighs quoti know how it sounds its so simple quot i see her struggling to explain quoti just wait to speak i wait for god sometimes its just soundsquot quotglossolaliaquot she nods quotive seen that my friends and i used to peer in the windows at the holy roller and snakehandling churches way down in south georgiaquot i dont say that those people fell to the floor writhing and drooling that we ran away scared out of our socks this woman in her dana buchman suit and good haircut seems as sane as the united pilot of this plane quothave you ever heard of a charismatic prophet thats my calling i knew i was going to sit beside someone on this flight who would change my life i always wanted to write now i hear how you do it and it frees me to try god put me beside you someone he says with a holy approach to writingquot now im really fascinated someone who not only hears the voice of god but speaks in the tongues of angels and knows whats coming toward us and i like hearing gods perception that my approach to writing is holy no one ever has talked to me about the nature of my involvement with words ive heard plenty about the words themselves but not about the vocation i have turbulence starts to shake the overhead compartments a queasy flyer i begin to wonder if maybe she is an angel sent to accompany me to the afterlife when the plane spirals down into the atlantic but soon the seat belt light flicks off and the long flight across the waters black then leaden then streaked with sterling light continues as we start our descent into the rainy skies of paris she says quoti dont do this i dont like to debase my gift but i will tell you something you are travelling with three angels one is ministering one is protecting and i dont know what the other one is forquot quotoh noquot i say instantly pessimistic quotangel of deathquot she laughs quotgod tells me you are too fatalistic the third angel is something very goodquot maybe its the skipping across time zones or the cabin pressure or the lack of sleep but i willingly close my eyes and try to sense the presence of three angels privately im shaken because when i first went to italy and bought my house i had a dream that the house held one hundred angels and that i would discover them one by one metaphorically that came true starting my travels i have been given by a stranger three angels to go with me without a shred of belief i cant deny that i am touched i give her a list of books ive mentioned and a card with my first name printed on it i start to write my address but decide that if she wants to reach me god will direct her madrid all the connections worked i find ed waiting in baggage claim he looks forlornhe has arrived with a sinus infection exacerbated by the changes in pressure while landing i touch his forehead and find him hot and clammy quotwhen i left bramasole i was feverish but determined to go i had toyoud be waiting at the ticket counter in rome i discovered id left my passport at the house i wanted to climb into a luggage cart and go to sleep i couldnt face a twohour drive up to cortona and two hours backbesides giorgio had dropped me at the curb i asked about the next flight and it was in three hours i was totally screwed theni dont know whythe woman handed me a paper to sign and she said youre going on this flight quot quotyou mean you flew out of italy without a passportquot im so shocked i cant utter a whole sentence this seems impossible but here he is his steady eyes smiling at the thought that he slipped freely across international boundaries were waiting for my bag but the remaining ones looping around the claim belt are fewer and fewer quotscary isnt itquot quotafter september 11 they let a man on a plane with no papersquot quotmaybe it was because i was wearing an italian suit another guy badly dressed was trying to get on and they didnt let himquot my bag has definitely stayed behind in san francisco or paris and i cant find the envelope with the claim check tacked on wheres my damn ministering angel i have been travelling twenty hours we queue with a dozen others because i changed carriers in paris the poutymouthed air france clerk assures me they have no responsibility for my lost bag especially since i have no proof that i even checked a bag a big spanish man with a zapata mustache takes my side and two australian boys start chanting quotair chance air chancequot finally miss cool decides shell take my hotel number and send out a tracer as our taxi spins out of the airport on two wheels ed says quotnot for nothing is that etymological connection between travel and travail quot the rain looks sooty falling on leadgray buildings suddenly the driver swings around a circle with an enormous fountain then were on a treelined street along an esplanade lined with one grand building after another ah madrid the hotel lights blurry in the rain look festive and welcoming in our room we find a chilled cava spanish sparkling wine sent by lina a thoughtful italian friend ed falls into bed after stoking himself with various antihistamines i pop open the cava pour a glass empty both little bottles of bubble bath into the tub and immerse myself since dinner is late in spain we planned to drift out at tenthirty but were exhausted and instead decide to order room service ed feels dizzy at eleven the miracle of my suitcase occursthere it is wet dirty but delivered i want comfort food my first meal in spain spaghetti with bolognese sauce
