the table from jim neyland chief of the tampa branch of the jacksonville district of the internal revenue service it was afterhours his tie was loose around his neck and his shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows he was about fifty with thinning saltandpepper hair and a bushy black mustache i had just turned twentyeight and was wearing a tenyearold suit with a tendayold dark blue tie the interview had been scheduled to begin an hour earlier but i had waited in the reception area of the branch office while his secretary fussed at her desk and his loud voice boomed throughout the office as he made dinner arrangements on the phone there were no magazines to read no television to stare blankly at while i waited in one corner sat a dusty plastic palm tree the carpeting was dark blue the divider separating the secretarys workstation from the waiting area was white the ceiling was white on the white wall directly opposite me were two large framed photographs one of the sunshine skyway bridge and another of the space shuttle challenger the bridge had collapsed into tampa bay in 1980 killing thirtyfive people challenger had exploded in 1986 seconds after the photograph was taken jim neyland did not want chinese he wanted barbecue he had been thinking about it all day and his heart was set on barbecue he hated chinese he was always hungry again thirty minutes later he wanted some barbecue pork and some beans and corn on the cob and some coleslaw and he didnt give a good goddamn what everybody else wanted no not italian either there would be no compromise where he was concerned it was barbecue or nothing the secretary flashed an apologetic smile in my direction and buzzed him again mr yancey is here for his interview he apparently didnt hear her i examined my new tie for any picks stains or hitherto unnoticed blotches i had to urinate but knew the moment i bolted for the bathroom jim neyland would turn the corner from the inner recesses of his office looking for me i stared at the picture of challenger like most americans i could remember exactly where i was and what i was doing when i heard the news how long ago that seemed a lifetime or two and now i was here four months after answering an ad in the newspaper more on a whim than design my destination my mission was not as clearly defined as challengers but in its own way was no less perilous i need the job i answered i had decided not to repeat the preface i had used in my second interview which had taken place two weeks prior to this one well i never dreamed of being a tax collector when i grew up this had not gone over well with one of my interrogators and it sounds like very interesting work well youll never be bored jim neyland said he picked up a folder and opened it i could see my name printed on its face in large black letters yancey john richard inside were my application and notes from the first two interviews i folded my hands in my lap rubbing the tips of my thumbs against my slick palms there was a motelroom quality print of a beach scene on the wall behind jim neyland with a lone seagull perched on a picket fence staring out over the dark ocean so you went to law school his hair was thinning at the crown a perfectly round bald spot about the size of a golf ball curly black hair carpeted his forearms for a year what happened i left you dropped out i dropped out why did you drop
