 1 london it was ali massoudi who unwittingly roused gabriel allon from his brief and restless retirement massoudi the great europhile intellectual and freethinker who in a moment of blind panic forgot that the english drive on the left side of the road the backdrop for his demise was a rainswept october evening in bloomsbury the occasion was the final session of the first annual policy forum for peace and security in palestine iraq and beyond the conference had been launched early that morning amid great hope and fanfare but by dayrsquos end it had taken on the quality of a traveling production of a mediocre play even the demonstrators who came in hope of sharing some of the flickering spotlight seemed to realize they were reading from the same tired script the american president was burned in effigy at ten the israeli prime minister was put to the purifying flame at eleven at lunchtime amid a deluge that briefly turned russell square into a pond there had been a folly having something to do with the rights of women in saudi arabia at eightthirty as the gavel came down on the final panel the two dozen stoics who had stayed to the end filed numbly toward the exits organizers of the affair detected little appetite for a return engagement next autumn a stagehand stole forward and removed a placard from the rostrum that read gaza is liberatedmdashwhat now the first panelist on his feet was sayyid of the london school of economics defender of the suicide bombers apologist for alqaeda next was the austere chamberlain of cambridge who spoke of palestine and the jews as though they were still the quandary of graysuited men from the foreign office throughout the discussion the aging chamberlain had served as a sort of separation fence between the incendiary sayyid and a poor soul from the israeli embassy named rachel who had drawn hoots and whistles of disapproval each time shersquod opened her mouth chamberlain tried to play the role of peacekeeper now as sayyid pursued rachel to the door with taunts that her days as a colonizer were drawing to an end ali massoudi graduate professor of global governance and social theory at the university of bremen was the last to rise hardly surprising his jealous colleagues might have said for among the incestuous world of middle eastern studies massoudi had the reputation of one who never willingly relinquished a stage palestinian by birth jordanian by passport and european by upbringing and education professor massoudi appeared to all the world like a man of moderation the shining future of arabia they called him the very face of progress he was known to be distrustful of religion in general and militant islam in particular in newspaper editorials in lecture halls and on television he could always be counted on to lament the dysfunction of the arab world its failure to properly educate its people its tendency to blame the americans and the zionists for all its ailments his last book had amounted to a clarion call for an islamic reformation the jihadists had denounced him as a heretic the moderates had proclaimed he had the courage of martin luther that afternoon he had argued much to sayyidrsquos dismay that the ball was now squarely in the palestinian court until the palestinians part company with the culture of terror massoudi had said the israelis could never be expected to cede an inch of the west bank nor should they sacrilege sayyid had cried apostasy professor massoudi was tall a bit over six feet in height and far too good looking for a man who worked in close proximity to impressionable young women his hair was dark and curly his cheekbones wide and strong and his square chin had a deep notch in the center the eyes were brown and deeply set and lent his face an air of profound and reassuring intelligence dressed as he was now in a cashmere sport jacket and creamcolored rollneck sweater he seemed the very archetype of the european intellectual it was an image he worked hard to convey naturally deliberate of movement he packed his papers and pens methodically into his welltraveled briefcase then descended the steps from the stage and headed up the center aisle toward the exit several members of the audience were loitering in the foyer standing to one side a stormy island in an otherwise tranquil sea was the girl she wore faded jeans a leather jacket and a checkered palestinian kaffiyeh round her neck her black hair shone like a ravenrsquos wing her eyes were nearly black too but shone with something else her name was hamida altatari a refugee she had said born in amman raised in hamburg now a citizen of canada residing in north london massoudi had met her that afternoon at a reception in the student union over coffee she had fervently accused him of insufficient outrage over the crimes of the americans and jews massoudi had liked what he had seen they were planning to have drinks that evening at the wine bar next to the theater in sloane square his intentions werenrsquot romantic it wasnrsquot hamidarsquos body he wanted it was her zeal and her clean face her perfect english and canadian passport she gave him a furtive glance as he crossed the foyer but made no attempt to speak to him keep your distance after the symposium he had instructed her that afternoon a man in my position has to be careful about who hersquos seen with outside he sheltered for a moment beneath the portico and gazed at the traffic moving sluggishly along the wet street he felt someone brush against his elbow then watched as hamida plunged wordlessly into the cloudburst he waited until she was gone then hung his briefcase from his shoulder and set out in the opposite direction toward his hotel in russell square the change came over himmdashthe same change that always occurred whenever he moved from one life to the other the quickening of the pulse the sharpening of the senses the sudden fondness for small details such as the balding young man walking toward him beneath the shelter of an umbrella whose gaze seemed to linger on massoudirsquos face an instant too long or the newsagent who stared brazenly into massoudirsquos eyes as he purchased a copy of the evening standard or the taxi driver who watched him thirty seconds later as he dropped the same newspaper into a rubbish bin in upper woburn place a london bus overtook him as it churned slowly past massoudi peered through the fogged windows and saw a dozen tiredlooking faces nearly all of them black or brown the new londoners he thought and for a moment the professor of global governance and social theory wrestled with the implications of this how many secretly sympathized with his cause how many would sign on the dotted line if he laid before them a contract of death in the wake of the bus on the opposite pavement was a single pedestrian oilskin raincoat stubby ponytail two straight lines for eyebrows massoudi recognized him instantly the young man had been at the conferencemdashsame row as hamida but on the opposite side of the auditorium hersquod been sitting in the same seat earlier that morning when massoudi had been the lone dissenting voice during a panel discussion on the virtue of barring israeli academics from european shores massoudi lowered his gaze and kept walking while his left hand went involuntarily to the shoulder strap of his briefcase was he being followed if so by whom mi5 was the most likely explanation the most likely he reminded himself but not the only one perhaps the german bnd had followed him to london from bremen or perhaps he was under cia surveillance but it was the fourth possibility that made massoudirsquos heart bang suddenly against his rib cage what if the man was not english or german or american at all what if he worked for an intelligence service that showed little compunction about liquidating its enemies even on the streets of foreign capitals an intelligence service with a history of using women as bait he thought of what hamida had said to him that afternoon ldquoi grew up in toronto mostlyrdquo ldquoand before thatrdquo ldquoamman when i was very young then a year in hamburg irsquom a palestinian professor my home is a suitcaserdquo massoudi made a sudden turn off woburn place into the tangle of side streets of st pancras after a few paces he slowed and looked over his shoulder the man in the oilskin coat had crossed the street and was following after him he quickened his pace made a series of turns left and right here a row of mews houses here a block of flats here an empty square littered with dead leaves massoudi saw little of it he was trying to keep his orientation he knew londonrsquos main thoroughfares well enough but the backstreets were a mystery to him he threw all tradecraft to the wind and made regular glances over his shoulder each glance seemed to find the man a pace or two closer he came to an intersection looked left and saw traffic rushing along the euston road on the opposite side he knew lay kingrsquos cross and st pancras stations he turned in that direction then a few seconds later glanced over his shoulder the man had rounded the corner and was coming after him he began to run he had never been much of an athlete and years of academic pursuits had robbed his body of fitness the weight of the laptop computer in his briefcase was like an anchor with each stride the case banged against his hip he secured it with his elbow and held the strap with his other hand but this gave his stride an awkward galloping rhythm that slowed him even more he considered jettisoning it but clung to it instead in the wrong hands the laptop was a treasure trove of information personnel surveillance photographs communications links bank accountshellip he stumbled to a stop at the euston road glancing over his shoulder he saw his pursuer still plodding methodically toward him hands in his pockets eyes down he looked to his left saw empty asphalt and stepped off the curb the groan of the lorry horn was the last sound ali massoudi ever heard at impact the briefcase broke free of him it took flight turned over several times as it hovered above the road then landed on the street with a solid thud the man in the oilskin raincoat barely had to break stride as he bent down and snared it by the strap he slipped it neatly over his shoulder crossed the euston road and followed the evening commuters into kingrsquos cross 2 jerusalem the briefcase had reached paris by dawn and by eleven it was being carried into an anonymouslooking office block on king saul boulevard in tel aviv there the professorrsquos personal effects were hastily inspected while the hard drive of his laptop computer was subjected to a sustained assault by a team of technical wizards by three that afternoon the first packet of intelligence had been forwarded to the prime ministerrsquos office in jerusalem and by five a manila file folder containing the most alarming material was in the back of an armored peugeot limousine heading toward narkiss street a quiet leafy lane not far from the ben yehuda mall the car stopped in front of the small apartment house at number 16 ari shamron the twice former chief of the israeli secret service now special adviser to the prime minister on all matters dealing with security and intelligence emerged from the backseat rami the blackeyed chief of his personal security detail moved silently at his heels shamron had made countless enemies during his long and turbulent career and because of israelrsquos tangled demographics many were uncomfortably close shamron even when he was inside his fortresslike villa in tiberias was surrounded always by bodyguards he paused for a moment on the garden walkway and looked up it was a dowdy little building of jerusalem limestone three floors in height with a large eucalyptus tree in front that cast a pleasant shadow over the front balconies the limbs of the tree were swaying in the first cool wind of autumn and from the open window on the third floor came the sharp odor of paint thinner shamron as he entered the foyer glanced at the mailbox for apartment number three and saw it was absent a nameplate he mounted the stairs and tramped slowly upward he was short of stature and was dressed as usual in khaki trousers and a scuffed leather jacket with a tear in the right breast his face was full of cracks and fissures and his remaining fringe of gray hair was cropped so short as to be nearly invisible his hands were leathery and liverspotted and seemed to have been borrowed from a man twice his size in one was the file the door was ajar when he arrived on the thirdfloor landing he placed his fingers against it and gently pushed the flat he entered had once been meticulously decorated by a beautiful italianjewish woman of impeccable taste now the furniture like the beautiful italian woman was gone and the flat had been turned into an artistrsquos studio not an artist shamron had to remind himself gabriel allon was a restorermdashone of the three or four most soughtafter restorers in the world he was standing now before an enormous canvas depicting a man surrounded by large predatory cats shamron settled himself quietly on a paintsmudged stool and watched him work for a few moments he had always been mystified by gabrielrsquos ability to imitate the brushstrokes of the old masters to shamron it was something of a parlor trick just another of gabrielrsquos gifts to be utilized like his languages or his ability to get a beretta off his hip and into firing position in the time it takes most men to clap their hands ldquoit certainly looks better than when it first arrivedrdquo shamron said ldquobut i still donrsquot know why anyone would want to hang it his homerdquo ldquoit wonrsquot end up in a private homerdquo gabriel said his brush to the canvas ldquothis is a museum piecerdquo ldquowho painted itrdquo shamron asked abruptly as though inquiring about the perpetrator of a bombing ldquobohnams auction house in london thought it was erasmus quellinusrdquo gabriel said ldquoquellinus might have laid the foundations but itrsquos clear to me that rubens finished it for himrdquo he moved his hand over the large canvas ldquohis brushstrokes are everywhererdquo ldquowhat difference does it makerdquo ldquoabout ten million poundsrdquo gabriel said ldquojulian is going to do very nicely with this onerdquo julian isherwood was a london art dealer and sometime secret servant of israeli intelligence the service had a long name that had very little to do with the true nature of its work men like shamron and gabriel referred to it as the office and nothing more ldquoi hope julian is giving you fair compensationrdquo ldquomy restoration fee plus a small commission on the salerdquo ldquowhatrsquos the totalrdquo gabriel tapped his brush against his palette and resumed working ldquowe need to talkrdquo shamron said ldquoso talkrdquo ldquoirsquom not going to talk to your backrdquo gabriel turned and peered at shamron once more through the lenses of his magnifying visor ldquoand irsquom not going to talk to you while yoursquore wearing those things you look like something from my nightmaresrdquo gabriel reluctantly set his palette on the worktable and removed his magnifying visor revealing a pair of eyes that were a shocking shade of emerald green he was below average in height and had the spare physique of a cyclist his face was high at the forehead and narrow at the chin and he had a long bony nose that looked as though it had been carved from wood his hair was cropped short and shot with gray at the temples it was because of shamron that gabriel was an art restorer and not one of the finest painters of his generationmdashand why his temples had turned gray virtually overnight when he was in his early twenties shamron had been the intelligence officer chosen by golda meir to hunt down and assassinate the perpetrators of the 1972 munich massacre and a promising young art student named gabriel allon had been his primary gunman he spent a few moments cleaning his palette and brushes then went into the kitchen shamron sat down at the small table and waited for gabriel to turn his back before hurriedly lighting one of his foulsmelling turkish cigarettes gabriel hearing the familiar clickclick of shamronrsquos old zippo lighter pointed toward the rubens in exasperation but shamron made a dismissive gesture and defiantly raised the cigarette to his lips a comfortable silence settled between them while gabriel poured bottled water into the teakettle and spooned coffee into the french press shamron was content to listen to the wind moving in the eucalyptus trees outside in the garden devoutly secular he marked the passage of time not by the jewish festivals but by the rhythms of the landmdashthe day the rains came the day the wildflowers exploded in the galilee the day the cool winds returned gabriel could read his thoughts another autumn and wersquore still here the covenant had not been revoked ldquothe prime minister wants an answerrdquo shamronrsquos gaze still was focused on the tangled little garden ldquohersquos a patient man but he wonrsquot wait foreverrdquo ldquoi told you that irsquod give him an answer when i was finished with the paintingrdquo shamron looked at gabriel ldquodoes your arrogance know no bounds the prime minister of the state of israel wants you to be chief of special operations and you put him off over some fivehundred yearold piece of canvasrdquo ldquo four hundredrdquo gabriel carried the coffee to the table and poured two cups shamron scooped sugar into his and gave it a single violent stir ldquoyou said yourself the painting is nearly finished what is your answer going to berdquo ldquoi havenrsquot decidedrdquo ldquomay i offer you a piece of helpful advicerdquo ldquoand if i donrsquot want your advicerdquo ldquoirsquod give it to you anywayrdquo shamron squeezed the life out of his cigarette butt ldquoyou should accept the prime ministerrsquos offer before he makes it to someone elserdquo ldquonothing would make me happierrdquo ldquoreally and what will you do with yourselfrdquo greeted by silence shamron pressed on ldquoallow me to paint a picture for you gabriel irsquoll do the best i can irsquom not gifted like you i donrsquot come from a great germanjewish intellectual family irsquom just a poor polish jew whose father sold pots from the back of a handcartrdquo shamronrsquos murderous polish accent had grown thicker gabriel couldnrsquot help but smile he knew that whenever shamron played the downtrodden jew from lvov something entertaining was certain to follow ldquoyou have nowhere else to go gabriel you said it yourself when we offered you the job the first time what will you do when yoursquore finished with this rubens of yours do you have any more work lined uprdquo shamronrsquos pause was theatrical in nature for he knew the answer was no ldquoyou canrsquot go back to europe until yoursquore officially cleared in the bombing of the gare de lyon julian might send you another painting but eventually that will end too because the packing and shipping costs will cut into his already tenuous bottom line do you see my point gabrielrdquo ldquoi see it very clearly yoursquore trying to use my unfortunate situation as a means of blackmailing me into taking operationsrdquo ldquoblackmail no gabriel i know the meaning of blackmail and god knows irsquove been known to use it when it suits my needs but this is not blackmail irsquom trying to help yourdquo ldquohelprdquo ldquotell me something gabriel what do you plan to do for moneyrdquo ldquoi have moneyrdquo ldquoenough to live like a hermit but not enough to live rdquo shamron lapsed into a momentary silence and listened to the wind ldquoitrsquos quiet now isnrsquot it tranquil almost itrsquos tempting to think it can go on like this forever but it canrsquot we gave them gaza without demanding anything in return and they repaid us by freely electing hamas to be their rulers next theyrsquoll want the west bank and if we donrsquot surrender it in short order therersquos going to be another round of bloodletting much worse than even the second intifada trust me gabriel one day soon it will all start up again and not just here everywhere do you think theyrsquore sitting on their hands doing nothing of course not theyrsquore planning the next campaign theyrsquore talking to osama and his friends too we now know for a fact that the palestinian authority has been thoroughly penetrated by alqaeda and its affiliates we also know that they are planning major attacks against israel and israeli targets abroad in the very near future the office also believes the prime minister has been targeted for assassination along with senior advisersrdquo ldquoyou includedrdquo ldquoof courserdquo shamron said ldquoi am after all the prime ministerrsquos special adviser on all matters dealing with security and terrorism my death would be a tremendous symbolic victory for themrdquo he looked out the window again at the wind moving in the trees ldquoitrsquos ironic isnrsquot it this place was supposed to be our sanctuary now in an odd way itrsquos left us more vulnerable than ever nearly half the worldrsquos jews live in this tiny strip of land one small nuclear device thatrsquos all it would take the americans could survive one the russians might barely notice it but us a bomb in tel aviv would kill a quarter of the countryrsquos populationmdash maybe morerdquo ldquoand you need me to prevent this apocalypse i thought the office was in good hands these daysrdquo ldquothings are definitely better now that lev has been shown the door amos is an extraordinarily competent leader and administrator but sometimes i think he has a bit too much of the soldier in himrdquo ldquohe was chief of both the sayeret matkal and aman what did you expectrdquo ldquowe knew what we were getting with amos but the prime minister and i are now concerned that hersquos trying to turn king saul boulevard into an outpost of the idf we want the office to retain its original characterrdquo ldquoinsanityrdquo ldquoboldnessrdquo countered shamron ldquoaudacity i just wish amos would think a little less like a battlefield commander and a little more like rdquo his voice trailed off while he searched for the right word when he found it he rubbed his first two fingers against his thumb and said ldquolike an artist i need someone by his side who thinks more like caravaggiordquo ldquocaravaggio was a madmanrdquo ldquoexactlyrdquo shamron started to light another cigarette but this time gabriel managed to stay his hand before hersquod struck his lighter shamron looked at him his eyes suddenly serious ldquowe need you now gabriel two hours ago the chief of special operations handed amos his letter of resignationrdquo ldquowhyrdquo ldquolondonrdquo shamron looked down at his captured hand ldquomay i have that backrdquo gabriel let go of the thick wrist shamron rolled the unlit cigarette between his thumb and forefinger ldquowhat happened in londonrdquo gabriel asked ldquoirsquom afraid we had a bit of a mishap there last nightrdquo ldquoa mishap when the office has a mishap someone usually ends up deadrdquo shamron nodded in agreement ldquowell at least therersquos something to be said for consistencyrdquo ldquodoes the name ali massoudi mean anything to yourdquo ldquohersquos professor of something or other at a university in germanyrdquo gabriel replied ldquolikes to play the role of an iconoclast and a reformer i actually met him oncerdquo shamronrsquos eyebrows went up in surprise ldquoreally whererdquo ldquohe came to venice a couple of years ago for a big middle east symposium as part of their stipend the participants got a guided tour of the city one of their stops was the church of san zaccaria where i was restoring the bellini altarpiecerdquo for several years gabriel had lived and worked in venice under the name mario delvecchio six months earlier he had been forced to flee the city after being discovered there by a palestinian masterterrorist named khaled alkhalifa the affair had ended at the gare de lyon and in the aftermath gabrielrsquos name and secret past had been splashed across the french and european press including an exposeacute in the sunday times that referred to him as ldquoisraelrsquos angel of deathrdquo he was still wanted for questioning by the paris police and a palestinian civil rights group had filed a lawsuit in london alleging war crimes ldquoand you actually met massoudirdquo shamron asked incredulously ldquoyou shook his handrdquo ldquoas mario delvecchio of courserdquo ldquoi suppose you didnrsquot realize that you were shaking hands with a terroristrdquo shamron stuck the end of the cigarette between his lips and struck his zippo this time gabriel didnrsquot intervene ldquothree months ago we got a tip from a friend at the jordanian gid that professor ali massoudi that great moderate and reformer was actually a talent scout for alqaeda according to the jordanians he was looking for recruits to attack israeli and jewish targets in europe peace conferences and antiisrael demonstrations were his favorite hunting grounds we werenrsquot surprised by that part wersquove known for some time that the peace conferences have become a meeting place for alqaeda operatives and european extremists of both the leftwing and rightwing variety we decided it would be wise to put professor massoudi under watch we got to the telephone in his apartment in bremen but the yield was disappointing to put it mildly he was very good on the phone then about a month ago london station chipped in with a timely piece of information it seems the cultural section of the london embassy had been asked to provide a warm body for something called the policy forum for peace and security in palestine iraq and beyond when cultural asked for a list of the other participants guess whose name appeared on itrdquo ldquoprofessor ali massoudirdquo ldquocultural agreed to send a representative to the conference and special ops set its sights on massoudirdquo ldquowhat kind of operation was itrdquo ldquosimplerdquo shamron said ldquocatch him in the act compromise him threaten him turn him around can you imagine an agent inside the alqaeda personnel department with massoudirsquos help we could have rolled up their european networksrdquo ldquoso what happenedrdquo ldquowe put a girl on his plate she called herself hamida altatari her real name is aviva and shersquos from ramat gan but thatrsquos neither here nor there she met massoudi at a reception massoudi was intrigued and agreed to meet her again later that evening for a more lengthy discussion of the current state of the world we followed massoudi after the last session of the conference but massoudi apparently spotted the watcher and started to run he looked the wrong way while crossing the euston road and stepped in front of a delivery truckrdquo gabriel winced ldquofortunately we didnrsquot come away completely emptyhandedrdquo shamron said ldquothe watcher made off with massoudirsquos briefcase among other things it contained a laptop computer it seems professor ali massoudi was more than just a talent spotterrdquo shamron placed the file folder in front of gabriel and with a terse nod of his head instructed gabriel to open the cover inside he found a stack of surveillance photographs st peterrsquos square from a dozen different angles the faccedilade and interior of the basilica swiss guards standing watch at the arch of bells it was clear the photos had not been taken by an ordinary tourist because the cameraman had been far less interested in the visual aesthetics of the vatican than the security measures surrounding it there were several snapshots of the barricades along the western edge of the square and the metal detectors along berninirsquos colonnademdashand several more of the vigilanza and carabinieri who patrolled the square during large gatherings including closeups of their side arms the final three photographs showed pope paul vii greeting a crowd in st peterrsquos square in his glassenclosed popemobile the camera lens had been focused not on the holy father but on the plainclothes swiss guards walking at his side gabriel viewed the photos a second time based on the quality of the light and the clothing worn by the crowds of pilgrims it appeared that they had been taken on at least three separate occasions repeated photographic surveillance of the same target he knew was a hallmark of a serious alqaeda operation he closed the file and held it out to shamron but shamron wouldnrsquot accept it gabriel regarded the old manrsquos face with the same intensity hersquod studied the photographs he could tell there was more bad news to come ldquotechnical found something else on massoudirsquos computerrdquo shamron said ldquoinstructions for accessing a numbered bank account in zurichmdashan account wersquove known about for some time because itrsquos received regular infusions of money from something called the committee to liberate alqudsrdquo alquds was the arabic name for jerusalem ldquowhorsquos behind itrdquo gabriel asked ldquosaudi arabiardquo said shamron ldquoto be more specific the interior minister of saudi arabia prince nabilrdquo inside the office nabil was routinely referred to as the prince of darkness for his hatred of israel and the united states and his support of islamic militancy around the globe ldquonabil created the committee at the height of the second intifadardquo shamron continued ldquohe raises the money himself and personally oversees the distribution we believe he has a hundred million dollars at his disposal and hersquos funneling it to some of the most violent terror groups in the world including elements of alqaedardquo ldquowhorsquos giving nabil the moneyrdquo ldquounlike the other saudi charities the committee for the liberation of alquds has a very small donor base we think nabil raises the money from a handful of saudi multimillionairesrdquo shamron peered into his coffee for a moment ldquocharityrdquo he said his tone disdainful ldquoa lovely word isnrsquot it but saudi charity has always been a two edged sword the muslim world league the international islamic relief organization the alharamayn islamic foundation the benevolence international foundationmdashthey are to saudi arabia what the comintern was to the old soviet union a means of propagating the faith islam and not just any form of islam saudi arabiarsquos puritanical brand of islam wahhabism the charities build mosques and islamic centers around the world and madrassas that churn out the wahhabi militants of tomorrow and they also give money directly to the terrorists including our friends in hamas the engines of america run on saudi oil but the networks of global islamic terrorism run largely on saudi moneyrdquo ldquocharity is the third pillar of islamrdquo gabriel said ldquo zakat rdquo ldquoand a noble qualityrdquo shamron said ldquoaccept when the zakat ends up in the hands of murderersrdquo ldquodo you think ali massoudi was connected to the saudis by more than moneyrdquo ldquowe may never know because the great professor is no longer with us but whomever he was working for clearly has his sights set on the vaticanmdash and someone needs to tell themrdquo ldquoi suspect you have someone in mind for the jobrdquo ldquoconsider it your first assignment as chief of special opsrdquo shamron said ldquothe prime minister wants you to step into the breach immediately rdquo ldquoand amosrdquo ldquoamos has another name in mind but the prime minister and i have made it clear to him who we want in the jobrdquo ldquomy own record is hardly free of scandal and unfortunately the world now knows about itrdquo ldquothe gare de lyon affairrdquo shamron shrugged ldquoyou were lured into it by a clever opponent besides irsquove always believed that a career free of controversy is not a proper career at all the prime minister shares that viewrdquo ldquomaybe thatrsquos because hersquos been involved in a few scandals of his ownrdquoitalian soilmdashrdquo ldquotherersquos no need for you to go to romerdquo shamron said cutting him off ldquorome is coming to yourdquo ldquodonatirdquo shamron nodded ldquohow much did you tell himrdquo ldquoenough for him to ask alitalia if he could borrow a plane for a few hoursrdquo shamron said ldquohersquoll be here first thing in the morning show him the photographs tell him as much as you need to in order to impress upon him that we think the threat is crediblerdquo ldquoand if he asks for helprdquo shamron shrugged ldquogive him whatever he needsrdquo
