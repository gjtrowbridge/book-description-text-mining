 chapter one how does it feel to be one of the beautiful people from baby youre a rich man 1967 by john lennon and paul mccartney though id caught only the briefest glimpse from the corner of my eye i knew immediately that the brown creature darting across my warped hardwood floors was a water bug the largest meatiest insect id ever seen the superbug had narrowly avoided skimming across my bare feet before it disappeared under the bookcase trembling i forced myself to practice the chakra breathing id learned during an involuntary week at an ashram with my parents my heart rate slowed slightly after a few concentrated breaths of re on the inhale and lax on the exhale and within a few minutes i was functional enough to take some necessary precautions first i rescued millington who was also cowering in terror from her hiding place under the couch then in quick succession i zipped on a pair of kneehigh leather boots to cover my exposed legs opened the door to the hallway to encourage the bugs departure and began spraying the extrastrong blackmarket vermin poison on every available surface in my minuscule onebedroom i gripped the trigger as though it were an assault weapon and was still spraying when the phone rang nearly ten minutes later the caller id flashed with penelopes number i almost screened her before i realized that she was one of only two potential refuges should the water bug manage to live through the fumigation and cruise through my living room again id need to crash with her or uncle will unsure where will was tonight i decided itd be wise to keep the lines of communication intact i answered pen im under attack by the largest roach in manhattan what do i do i asked the second i picked up the phone bette i have news she boomed back clearly indifferent to my panic news more important than my infestation avery just proposed penelope shrieked were engaged goddammit those two simple words were engaged could make one person so happy and another so miserable autopilot quickly kicked in reminding me that it would be inappropriate to say the least if i were to verbalize what i really thought hes a loser p hes a spoiled stoner little kid in the body of a big boy he knows youre out of his league and is putting a ring on your finger before you realize it as well worse by marrying him you will be merely biding your time until he replaces you with a younger hotter version of yourself ten years down the line leaving you to pick up the pieces dont do it dont do it dont do it ohmigod i shrieked right back congratulations im so happy for you oh bette i knew you would be i can barely even speak its just all happening so fast so fast hes the only guy youve dated since you were nineteen its not like this wasnt expected its been eight years i just hope he doesnt catch herpes at his bachelor party in vegas tell me everything when how ring i rattled off questions playing the best friend role fairly believably i thought all things considered well i cant talk too long because were at the st regis right now remember how he insisted on picking me up for work today before waiting for my answer she raced breathlessly ahead he had a car waiting outside and told me it was just because he couldnt get a cab and said that we were expected for dinner at his parents house in ten minutes of course i was a little annoyed that he hadnt even asked if i wanted to go to dinner there hed said hed made reservations at per se and you know how tough it is to get in there and we were having predrinks in the library when in walked both our parents before i knew what was happening he was down on one knee in front of all your parents he did the public proposal i knew i sounded horrified but i couldnt help it bette it was hardly public it was our parents and he said the sweetest things in the world i mean we never wouldve met if it werent for them so i can see his point and get this he gave me two rings two rings two rings a sevencarat flawless round in platinum that was his greatgreatgrandmothers for the real ring and then a very pretty threecarat aschercut with baguettes thats much more wearable wearable its not as though you can roam the streets of new york in a sevencarat rock you know i thought it was really smart two rings bette youre incoherent we went from there to per se where my father even managed to turn off his cell phone for the duration of dinner and make a reasonably nice toast and then we went for a carriage ride in central park and now were at a suite in the st regis i just had to call and tell you where oh where had my friend gone penelope whod never even shopped for engagement rings because she thought they all looked the same who had told me three months earlier when a mutual college friend had gotten engaged in the back of a horsedrawn carriage that it was the tackiest thing on earth had just morphed into a very close approximation of a stepford wife was i just bitter of course i was bitter the closest id come to getting engaged was reading the wedding announcements in the new york times aka the single girls sports page every sunday at brunch but that was beside the point im so glad you did and i cant wait to hear every last detail but youve got an engagement to consummate get off the phone with me and go make your fiance happy how weird does that sound fiance oh averys on a call from work i keep telling him to hang up she announced this loudly for his benefit but he just keeps talking and talking how has your night been ah another stellar friday lets see millington and i took a walk over to the river and some homeless guy gave her a biscuit along the way so she was really happy and then i came home and hopefully killed what must be the largest insect in the tristate area i ordered vietnamese but i threw it out when i remembered reading that some vietnamese place near me was shut down for cooking dog and so now im about to dine on reheated rice and beans and a packet of stale twizzlers oh christ i sound like a lean cuisine commercial dont i she just laughed clearly having no words of comfort at that particular moment the other line clicked indicating that she had another call oh its michael i have to tell him do you care if i threeway him in she asked sure id love to hear you tell him michael would undoubtedly commiserate with me over the entire situation once penelope hung up since he hated avery even more than i did there was a click which was followed by a brief silence and then another click everyone there penelope squealed this was not a girl who normally squealed michael bette you guys both on michael was a colleague of mine and penelopes at ubs but since hed made vp one of the youngest ever wed seen much less of him though michael had a serious girlfriend it took penelopes engagement to really drive the point home we were growing up hi girls michael said sounding exhausted michael guess what im engaged there was the tiniest beat of hesitation i knew that like me michael wasnt surprised but he would be trying hard to formulate a believably enthusiastic response pen thats fantastic news he all but shouted into the phone his volume did much to compensate for the lack of any genuine joy in his voice and i made a mental note to remember that for next time i know she sang back i knew you and bette would be so happy for me it just happened a few hours ago and im so excited well well obviously have to celebrate he said loudly black door just the three of us multiple shots of something strong and cheap definitely i added happy for something to say a celebration is most definitely in order okay honey penelope called into the distance our drinking plans understandably of little interest guys averys off the phone and is pulling on the cord avery stop ive got to run but ill call you both later bette see you at work tomorrow love you both there was a click and then michael said you still there sure am do you want to call me or should i call you wed all learned early on that you couldnt trust that the third line had disconnected and therefore always took the precaution of starting a new call before talking shit about the person whod hung up first i heard a highpitched voice in the background and he said dammit i just got paged i cant talk now can we talk tomorrow sure say hi to megu for me okay and michael please dont go and get engaged anytime soon i dont think i can handle you too he laughed you dont have to worry about that i promise ill talk to you tomorrow and bette chin up he might be one of the worst guys either of us has ever met but she seems happy and thats all you can ask for you know we hung up and i stared at the phone for a few minutes before twisting my body out the window in a futile attempt to see a few inches of comforting river landscape the apartment wasnt much but it was thankfully all mine i hadnt shared it in the nearly two years since cameron had moved out and even though it was so long and narrow that i could stretch my legs out and almost touch the opposite wall and even though it was located in murray hill and even though the floorboards were warping slightly and the water bugs had taken over i had reign over my own private palace the building was a cement monstrosity on thirtyfourth and first a multiwinged behemoth that housed such illustrious tenants as one teenage member of a dismantled boy band one professional squash player one blist porn star and her stable of visitors one average joe one former childhood actress who hadnt worked in two decades and hundreds upon hundreds of recent college graduates who couldnt quite handle the idea of leaving the dorm or the fraternity house for good it had sweeping east river views as long as ones definition of sweeping views includes a construction crane a couple of dumpsters a brick wall from the building next door and a patch of river approximately three inches wide that is only visible through unfathomable acts of contortion all of this glory was mine for the equivalent monthly cost of a fourbedroom twoandahalfbath singlefamily home upstate while still twisted on the couch i reviewed my reaction to the news i thought id sounded sincere enough if not downright ecstatic but penelope knew ecstatic wasnt in my nature id managed to ask about the rings plural and to state that i was very happy for her of course i hadnt mustered up anything truly heartfelt or meaningful but she was probably too giddy to notice overall a solid bplus performance my breathing had normalized enough to smoke another cigarette which made me feel slightly better the fact that the water bug hadnt resurfaced yet helped too i tried to assure myself that my unhappiness stemmed from my genuine concern that penelope was marrying a truly terrible guy and not from some deeprooted envy that she now had a fiance when i didnt have so much as a second date i couldnt it had been two years since cameron had moved out and though id cycled through the requisite stages of recovery job obsession retail obsession and food obsession and had gone on the usual round of blind dates drinksonly dates and the rarer fulldinner dates only two guys had made thirddate status and none had made fourth i told myself repeatedly that there wasnt anything wrong with me and regularly made penelope confirm this but i was seriously beginning to doubt the validity of that statement i lit a second cigarette off the first and ignored millingtons disapproving doggy stare the selfloathing was beginning to settle upon my shoulders like a familiar warm blanket what kind of evil person couldnt express genuine sincere happiness on one of the happiest days of her best friends life how conniving and insecure does one have to be to pray that the whole thing turns out to be a giant misunderstanding how did i get to be so wretched i picked up the phone and called uncle will looking for some sort of validation will aside from being one of the brightest and bitchiest people on the planet was my perpetual cheerleader he answered the phone with the slightest ginandtonic slur and i proceeded to give him the short lesspainful version of penelopes ultimate betrayal it sounds as though you feel guilty because penelope is very excited and youre not as happy for her as you should be yeah thats right well darling it could be far worse at least its not some variation on the theme where penelopes misery is providing you with happiness and fulfillment right huh schadenfreude youre not emotionally or otherwise benefiting from her unhappiness right shes not unhappy shes euphoric im the unhappy one well there you have it see youre not so terrible and you my dear are not marrying that spoiled little brat whose only godgiven talents appear to be spending his parents money and inhaling large quantities of marijuana am i mistaken no of course not it just feels like everythings changing penelopes my life and now shes getting married i knew it would happen eventually but i just didnt think eventually would be so soon marriage is for the bourgeoisie you know that bette this triggered a series of mental images of sunday brunches through the years will simon the essex me and the sunday styles section wed dissect the weddings for the duration of brunch never failing to collapse into evil giggles as we creatively read between the lines will continued why on earth are you eager to enter into a lifelong relationship the only purpose of which is to strangle every iota of individuality out of you i mean look at me sixtysix years old never married and im perfectly happy youre gay will and not only that but you wear a gold band on the ring finger of your left hand so whats your point you think id actually marry simon even if i could those samesex san francisco city hall weddings arent exactly my scene not on your life youve been living with him since before i was born you do realize that you are essentially married negative darling either one of us is free to leave at any point without any messy legal or emotional ramifications and thats why it works but enough of that im not telling you anything you dont already know tell me about the ring i filled him in on the details he really cared about while munching the remaining twizzlers and didnt even realize i had fallen asleep on the couch until close to 3 am when millington woofed her desire to sleep in a real bed i dragged us both to my room and buried my head under the pillow reminding myself over and over that this was not a disaster not a disaster not a disaster
