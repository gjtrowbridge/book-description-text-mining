 prologue november 16 1985 glienicke bridge between west berlin and east germany the darkness seemed colder more bitter at glienicke bridge when a spy exchange was about to begin jay tice shoved his hands deep into his topcoat pockets in a futile attempt to warm them as he scanned the forested hills and the steelandiron bridge black and forbidding in the first rays of dawn dusted with snow two stone centaurs flanked the long expanse towering over tices armored sedan and the two battered us army trucks on high alert a dozen soldiers carrying m16s and wearing pistols over their belted overcoats moved like shadows across the road and among the skeletal trees the nights snowfall had been light still it muffled the sounds of distant traffic tice missed nothing not the tension in his peoples faces certainly not the kalashnikovtoting east german soldiers on the far side of the bridge who patrolled slowly menacingly in the gray light they guarded pavel abendroth the renowned dissident and jewish refusenik and his warden stasi officer raina manhardt tice moved his gaze away he was a rumpled man of thirtyfour just shy of six feet tall his nose was straight his hair brown and of average length his mouth wide and implacable depending on the light his eyes were blue or brown his one distinctive feature was the deep cleft that notched his chin which was dramatic still tice had perfected the art of appearing almost bloodless clearly boring seldom did anyone remember him or his cleft chin unless he wanted them to quotissaa kaemquot the voice beside him demanded with a sharp movement of his head tice peered at his half of the predawn swap faisal alhadi a twentyyearold muslim militant caught in an arms deal tice had busted standing motionless and straight as a knife he was tices height but narrow with a highbridged nose and bony features dressed in american jeans and a duffel coat according to his dossier he spoke english but no one in the command had heard him use it oddly alhadi had yet to look at the bridge those waiting to be traded tended to stare across it with raw hunger tice checked his wristwatch quotissaa 512 daayi hidasharquot the trade must begin in just eleven minutes so it would be finished by 542 am sunrise this was glienicker brcke quotbridge of spiesquot witness to many of the cold wars most crucial exchanges it was a bridge leading nowhere unused except for the infrequent official vehicle on a military mission between the free west and the communist east and the occasional vital spy swap some exchanges were notorious and covered by the press others were secret as was this one before alhadi could respond a cars motor pierced the silence tice spun rifles lashed around the engine was a deep purr large and expensive its timing impeccable a mercedes as soon as tice read the license plate he waved an arm backward in a wide swing that those on both sides of the bridge could see signaling everyone to stand down wearing a camelhair overcoat palmer westwood stepped from the luxury car his hair was thick and pepper gray his features angular and grave fiftytwo years old westwood was the cias new associate deputy director of operations the addo just in from langley he was late as westwood hurried toward them he pulled out his pocket watch the fob was a small gold triangle flat with two jagged edges he checked the time then glanced at the terrorist quotany troublequot quotquiet so farquot tice told him quotwe should goquot westwood nodded and tice signaled the soldiers closed in they advanced as a group passing the sign that warned ominously in four languages you are leaving the american sector the old steel bridge was radiant ablaze in arc lights stretching ahead more than four hundred feet for the first time alhadi looked across then he stared as if he could not tear his gaze away his black eyes burning with fury he could no longer hide as tice followed his line of sight he began to understand the terrorists silence and apparent lack of interest quotcome over herequot tice ordered as they stopped at the edge quotstay on my leftquot the terrorist was righthanded tice turned away so alhadi could not see as he unbuttoned his coat pulled his pistol from the holster and slid it into his waistband he put another item into his left pocket when he turned back alhadi was in place on either side the dark forest was hushed still almost predatory tice checked his watch again and gazed across just as raina manhardt peered up from hers they nodded and stepped forward alone two enemy intelligence officers doing their duty alhadi caught up with tice while raina manhardt slowed for abendroth to join her jailed nine years in the gulag the jewish doctor had lost a third of his body weight from starvation rations and illness dressed in baggy clothes he pressed his earmuffs close and smiled as he matched manhardts steps the walk had begun as an icy wind gusted off the river tice moved close to alhadi and spoke in english quotyoure damn lucky if dr abendroth werent a cause clbre you wouldnt be going homequot alhadis eyes snapped his molten gaze was locked on the small man in the distance he said nothing quotthats it isnt itquot tice said softly quota jew is saving your life worse a humanrights jewish activist the west reveresquot quotmabahibish khanzeereenquot alhadi sneered his right hand twitched immediately tice used both hands to slap a handcuff on the wrist and squeeze it tight enough to inhibit circulation quotkeep walking now ive got a gun pointed at you under my coat too dammit dont pull away you dont want anyone to see this ala tool ala ikobriquot quotkufr infidels the jews are the enemies of islam jews are the source of all conflicts they are liars murderers if i am defending my home no one can call me a terrorist all infidels must diequot quotif you hadnt behaved yourself in lockup i never wouldve been able to talk langley into letting you go even for someone of abendroths stature up to now youve been smart but youll never make it home alive if you dont drop whatever youre carrying in your right handquot alhadis head jerked around quotwhat how did you knowquot his pinched face showed the pain caused by the handcuff for the past month ever since his capture in the shootout in west berlin alhadi had tried to hide his intelligence behind a mask of indifference but tice had noted his watchful gaze the small advantages he created for himself and his ability to perceive routine in an apparently randomized interrogation schedule his intelligence would argue against selfdestruction quotexperience keep walkingquot tice tightened the handcuff quotget rid of the weapon or youll never see damascus againquot for the first time doubt flickered in the young mans face quotdrop it sonquot tice said quotyoud be insane not to want to go home and this is the only chance youll get drop itquot the fire that had burned so feverishly in alhadis eyes died his fingers opened and a razored metal file fell silently into the snow a weapon of close assassination alhadi peered away but not before tice saw his humiliation he had failed then alhadis lips thinned he seemed to gather himself quotrelease mequot he ordered tice considered then reached over and unlocked the handcuff alhadi gave no acknowledgment instead he lifted his chin defiantly neither spoke as they closed in on the bridges center a gust of bitter wind needled tices face following protocol he stopped a yard from the fourinchwide white line that marked the border between west and east but his prisoner bolted toward it quothaltquot tice made a show of grabbing for his arm quotlaaquot without a glance at dr abendroth alhadi hurtled past as clouds of brittle snow exploded from the youths heels tice focused on raina manhardt a halfhead taller than the diminutive doctor she wore a fur hat and a stern expression quoti wish i could say it was a pleasurequot he spoke in german the stasi officers eyes flashed she responded in english with a perfect american accent quotso we meet again comrade ticequot she spun on her boot heel and followed her charge tice stared after her a few seconds then greeted dr abendroth quotits an honor sirquot quotspaseebaquot abendroth was excited he took two large steps into the west and pumped tices hand quotmy knees ache or i would fall down and kiss this old bridgequot they turned in unison and strode off the cold seemed to settle into tices bones he inhaled a deep breath quotyou were worriedquot dr abendroth asked curiously he had the wrinkled skin of a seventyyearold although he was only in his forties quotof course and youquot quoti gave that up long agoquot the dissidents smile deepened quoti prefer to think of pleasant thingsquot the return trip seemed longer to tice ahead the dawn rose slowly almost reluctantly above the bleak hills the waiting party of armed americans resembled a still life from some military album only palmer westwood seemed real in his camelhair overcoat he stalked back and forth furiously smoking a cigarette as soon as they stepped onto land tice introduced the two men the small shabby pediatrician took the hand of the tall genteel cia official quotyou came just to welcome me mr westwood you are so civilized i have shaken no ones hand in friendship in years other than another prisoners and now i have done it twice within minutesquot he gestured toward the stately mercedes where the driver stood at the open rear door waiting quotmy chariotquot tice gazed at it quotyesquot with a crisp nod dr abendroth marched off alone his head turning as if he were memorizing the world while palmer westwood followed tice paused and glanced over his shoulder on the other end of the bridge raina manhardt and alhadi were approaching their zil limousine when tice looked back westwood had stopped to grind out his cigarette beneath the toe of his wing tip tice shifted his focus to abendroth monitoring his approach to the open door of the sedan it was time taking a small step backward tice squared his shoulders and gave an almost imperceptible nod the percussive noise of a single rifle shot splintered the quiet blood and bone fragments exploded into the air and pavel abendroth pitched forward the back of his skull shattered by the bullet his right arm bounced off the doorframe and landed hard inside the sedan for an instant the escort of american soldiers froze their faces stunned then their rifles slashed up and moved violently searching for a target at the same time raina manhardt shoved a grinning faisal alhadi into the limo and dove in after him tice ran to abendroth bellowing at his people to alert headquarters and find the sniper with the stench of hot blood filling his nostrils tice crouched the pediatrician lay crumpled on a patch of dirty snow tice picked up the hand that had fallen inside the car thick calluses and ragged scars covered the palm showing the brutal labor and torture abendroth had endured tice found a faint pulse in the frail wrist growing weaker when it stopped he closed the dead mans staring eyes and lifted his head to watch across the length of glienicke bridge tires spinning on the snow the communist limo shot off toward east berlin part one i grew accustomed to walking on a knifes edge and could imagine no other life

all moments gerhard shoutens hurtled down an expert ski run that paralleled a razorback ridge following his friend kristoph maas sunlight drenched the snowmantled alps and the wide sky was a vault of sapphire blue gerhard reveled in the soaring exhilaration of speeding through the crisp new powder quotdas ist wahnsinnquot he shouted into the wind kristoph whooped in agreement quotsuper tollquot they flashed through a hushed stand of pines and into an open area their velocity increasing their skis hissing as the trail took them along the winding rim of a couloir on one side spread a slope of pristine snow gerhard glanced down the other a spectacular gorge so deep that housesize boulders at the bottom appeared to be mere pebbles it was breathtaking quotsieh dir das mal anquot he yelled but before his friend could admire the view his entire body seemed to recoil as if he had struck some obstacle hidden in the snow he gave an outraged bellow his skis lifted off the track and he was airborne gerhard leaned low into his skis frantically trying to reach him but kristoph shot off the edge and into the void two days later allenwood federal correctional complex allenwood pennsylvania at 640 am ten minutes past morning call at the crowded federal penitentiary in the susquehanna valley a stranger in civilian clothes marched down a gray cellblock staring straight ahead a bureau of prisons lieutenant led two guards followed all looked uneasy the man paused at a cell as soon as the door opened he moved inside and glared down at the solitary cot the blanket had been yanked aside to reveal blue prison trousers and shirt stuffed with crumpled newspapers and arranged to mimic a man lying on his side there was also a fake wood arm covered with fleshcolored upholstery from the prison factory with the pillow pounded high as if it covered a head and the blanket on top exposing part of the arm not even the obligatory flash of a guards light during nighttime checks would reveal that no one slept there quotclever bastardquot the stranger jerked a cell phone from his pocket he punched in a number and kept his voice low quothes gone all right im in his cell now ill quot quotseal it offquot the voice on the other end of the line ordered quotno ones to search it understand and for gods sake make sure no one tells the press that jay tice has escapedquot langley virginia at 906 am laurence litchfield the cias deputy director of operations the ddo handcarried a sealed white envelope down from the seventh floor to the staff operations center the soc which was responsible for casemanagement support to colleagues in the field in his midforties litchfield was lean with a runners wiry body and a lanky gait his eyes were carved deep into his face above them wide brows formed an inkblack line across his forehead the soc chief looked up from her desk quotgood morning mr litchfield we got some overnight requests from our people in yemen and qatar i was going to memo you about our progress with the intelligence summit but i can fill you in nowquot quotfirst i need to talk to one of your people elaine cunninghamquot she noted the envelope in his hand quotcunningham you know shes sidelinedquot quoti know show me where she isquot she nodded and led him out the door and down two long corridors and into a room crammed with gray modular cubicles which someone long ago had cynically dubbed the parking lot here a glacially changing landscape of some three dozen field officers waited like used cars collecting dust futures uncertain their covers had been irrevocably blown or they had proved inept or they had run into langley politics for many the next stop was the tedium of personnel or recruitment or curriculum or worst case dismissal the chief pointed out cunninghams cubicle among the maze and litchfield thanked her quotgo up to my office ill meet you therequot she left and he turned down the narrow aisle and found elaine cunningham in her cramped enclosure marching back and forth beside her desk arms crossed her shoulder propping her phone against her ear as she talked quietly into it she was a small woman twentynine years old and blond dressed in an unbuttoned black jacket white tshirt and belted black pants as he leaned against the frame of her cubicle to study her she glanced up and recognized him she winked one large blue eye in greeting and continued talking into the phone quotso your missing source is a broker in brussels hes a morose dane unmarried follows soccer he didnt show up for a blind date yesterday and missed the alternate meet this morning now you have word hes in the wind and copenhagen cant find himquot she pursed her lips her pace quickened quotall scandinavians tend to be stereotyped as morose but there are real national differences its the swedes who are mostly angstridden while the danes are more happygolucky so your morose dane may actually be swedish and if hes driving home he probably didnt stop in copenhagen but took the resund fixed link across the sound into malm when amateurs change identities they usually create legends based on what they already know if hes swedish especially if he comes from the malm area its possible he knows copenhagen well enough to fake it as his hometown and if he does its a good bet he speaks danish like a nativequot cunningham paused listening quotmy pleasure no this is the end of the langley road for me hey its been great working with you too you always give me interesting questionsquot as she hung up she grabbed the single sheet of paper in her printer tray quotmorning mr litchfield this is my lucky day who wouldve thought id get to resign to the ddo himself just to make it official heres my letterquot litchfield was unsurprised quotyoull make your psychologist happyquot he took the letter folded it into his pocket and sat in the only side chair quotthats what im all about making cia clinicians happyquot her smile did not involve her eyes quoti suspect you dont really want to quit people who excel seldom doquot as litchfield continued to watch she blinked then sank into her desk chair dressed in her simple black and white clothes her hair smoothed back into a ponytail at the nape of her neck and wearing little makeup she could pass as a cop or the leader of a gang of thieves this flexibility of affect would be easier for her than for some because she was neither beautiful nor ugly still she was pretty enough that she could use her looks her face was slender her cheekbones good her classic features slightly irregular and her golden hair shone litchfield had studied her file now he had seen her so far she was perfect quotwhat you say has a certain truth to itquot she acknowledged quotbut ive also heard it said that a rut is just like a grave only longer im in a rut im not doing langley any good and im not doing myself any good its time to get on with my life such as it isquot she gazed at the white envelope in his hand then peered up at him curiously quotbut i think you have something else in mindquot he inclined his head quoti have a job tailored to your talents and to your limitations to do it youll be in the field alone which you seem to prefer anywayquot quotnot necessarily its just that the bodies langley kept sending to partner with me turned out to be less than stellarquot quotyou dont trust anyone do youquot quotmy mother im fond of my mother i trust her unfortunately she lives far away in californiaquot quotyou trusted your husband too but hes dead afghanistan rightquot for a moment she appeared speechless she seemed to shrink grow calcified as hard as a tombstone he pushed her again quotyouve had a problem working with people since he died your psychologist has recommended langley let you goquot instead of exploding she nodded her expression was grim quotyou were one of our best huntersquot litchfield said quotright now i need the bestquot as a hunter her specialty was locating missing spies assets gone to ground quotlostquot foreign agents anyone in the covert world of interest to langley who had vanished and doing it in such a way that the public never knew he watched a reflective look cross her face it was time to change the subject quotwhy do you think you were so successfulquot quotprobably because i simply have a knack for itquot she said quoti steep myself in the psychology of my target until the physical evidence and clues take on new meaning thats all there is to itquot for the first time he smiled quotno theres far more than thatquot she was modest and she had not lost her temper all things considered she was clearly his best choice eyeing him speculatively she said quotwhen the ddo comes to call i figure something important has happened and when im on the verge of being fired and he still comes to call i figure it could be crucial so let me help you out if you think i can do the job tell me what it is and ill tell you whether i can or want to take it onquot he looked around quotnot here the assignment is with one of our special units and its mclassifiedquot quotmquot indicated an extraordinarily sensitive covert operation among the highest the united states bestowed singleletter security clearances meant the information was so secret it could be referred to only by initials her blue eyes snapped with excitement it had been a long time since shed had such an opportunity quotgive me back my resignation letter as long as i dont have to mommy fools ill deliverquot he handed it to her along with his envelope quotheres the address and the name of your contact plus my phone number its the usual protocol you hunt our regular people capture read memorize then shred everything including my number good luckquot the catoctin mountains maryland dense forests flowed dark and primeval down the ridged sides of the maryland mountains to where a roadside stop had been built on a green basin of land off busy highway 15 a cool breeze typical of the early hour at this time of year blew around the twopump gas station and parking lot and caf jay tice stood utterly still in shadows his bloody clothes announced he should be considered dangerous but there was something else about him that was perhaps even more sinister it was in his aging face where intelligence and violence warred just beneath the skin his hair was short the color of iron shavings two crevices curved down from either side of his nose to his mouth his chin was as firm as ever marked by the dramatic cleft he moved off through the trees at the rear of the caf142 he dropped to his haunches there were four windows on the back wall one was opaque glass two displayed customers eating and the fourth next to the doorway showed a desk and file cabinets that was the office just where he remembered the back door was open from it drifted the greasy odors of fried sausage and bacon tice looked around then sprinted to the doorway he peered cautiously inside quottwo eggs easyquot a voice yelled from the end of the cluttered hall quothalf stackquot within seconds he slipped unnoticed into the office he locked the door and activated the computer and while it booted up opened the window from somewhere inside the caf a newscast described a terrorist bombing by a group thought to be connected to alqaeda he sat down at the computer and created a new yahoo email account from which he opened a blank email addressed it and typed into the message window dogs run away call home as soon as he hit send he addressed another email with a different message unexpected storm forced evacuation in touch soon deleting all copies saved to the computer he turned it off he slid out the window stifling a groan as his hip grazed the lip furious that he was not as agile as he once was he closed the window and seconds later was in the forest again moving swiftly away chapter two washington dc controlling her excitement elaine cunningham drove her jaguar stype sport 30 red sleek and sumptuous across the potomac river and into the district as the beat of headshears quotwalking tapestryquot pounded from her speakers she reveled in the jags power and balance the seventeeninch herakles alloy wheels the birdseye maple dashboard and the softerthanskin leather upholstery she knew her love affair with this lump of luxury was shallow and she did not care it whispered when it cruised and it growled when poked awake who could resist that dupont circle was just a mile northwest of the white house as she drove around it she maintained her usual secondstage alert studying buildings the mass of cars the mobs of pedestrians a towering water fountain sparkled in the center of the parklike circle while beneath it people jogged drank caffe lattes and played chess the world looked safe and innocent but it was not which was why she always carried a weapon since rafes death she turned the jag up a hilly street its gears sweetly adjusting and found the address of the special unit an old twostory victorian with a wide front porch a brass plate proclaimed institute of international concerns a think tank for the new millennium it was a busy neighborhood people filled the sidewalks and cars lined the curbs duponts parking was nearly impossible only georgetowns was worse she rounded streets until she found a slot in which to wedge the jag carrying her shoulder bag she headed back wondering again what was so vital that the ddo himself had personally interviewed her as she hurried up the victorians brick walk the front door opened and an old woman stepped out she was slumped and lined silver hair wreathed her wrinkles she wore a black dress opaque support hose and hush puppies quotwelcome weve been expecting youquot the womans voice carried easily a tremor in it convincing to anyone passing by quotthanks good to be here im looking forward to working at the institutequot cunningham climbed the steps to the porch noting the womans hair was a wig and the cobweb of wrinkles only makeup so finely done that only an expert would know passing the woman she moved indoors and in a single practiced sweep took in the needlenose cameras embedded almost invisibly in the ceiling and the pinheadsize spots on the flocked wallpaper indicating motion detectors as expected the security was well cloaked and impressive she felt herself relax and yet her alertness increased she turned quotyoure hannah barculoquot according to her assignment letter from litchfield her contact was barculo chief of unit the unit was codenamed whippet quoti am this hornets nest has been mine for five yearsquot the woman closed the door a series of firm clicks sounded indicating electronic locks had snapped into place quotour gatekeepers on assignment sorry for the getup but ive been working just got in lets go to my officequot as they strode through a long foyer decorated with fake antiques barculos posture straightened and her movements grew fluid and athletic she was a good thirty years younger than she first appeared probably in her midforties quotlitchfield says youre good to goquot barculo said quotthat rightquot cunningham felt her chest tighten then she shook it off quotabsolutelyquot quotill be frank i didnt want youquot barculos expression was worried cunningham had not expected to be greeted with open arms quotill be frank too we both know the hunters considered firsttier are on assignment overseas but now theres some big emergency here that means im the best choice of the lesser lot if there were someone else without my checkered history the ddo wouldve chosen him or herquot barculo nodded quotlitchfield said we needed someone who could think without a book in this case thats you its also one of the qualities our quarrys known forquot they turned down a hall all doors were shut and no one was in sight as their footsteps sounded on the hardwood floor the old house creaked otherwise it seemed eerily quiet but safe headquarters were sometimes soundproofed completely barculo opened an unmarked door as she walked through she sighed peeled off her wig and shook out her short walnutbrown hair she sat behind a massive desk where two steaming ceramic mugs waited the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the office it was spacious with an elegant cove ceiling arching above there were chairs side tables shelves of books and a tv in another era it had probably been a sitting room as cunningham closed the door barculo said quotgrab some caffeine and a seatquot cunningham took a mug and chose a weathered armchair she dropped her shoulder bag quotanytime youre ready id like to know whats going onquot barculo stirred her coffee gazing into it when she looked up she appeared to have reconciled something in her mind quotdid you ever meet charles jay ticequot quoti heard him talk but i was never close enough to be introduced does this have to do with one of his old operationsquot quotmaybe what do you rememberquot quothe was a cold war icon of course a legend in the company supposed to have been a genius at running individuals and teamsquot quotright one way or another he had a hand in a lot of our most critical actions in europe you mustve studied some of them at the farmquot quotwe never knew which were his but i was told he was so devious he could outwit even markus wolfquot she asked curiously quotis that truequot quoti have no direct knowledge but i wouldnt be surprisedquot quoti also heard that one of the moles moscow executed had intel that mightve stopped 911 but because of tices betrayal it died with himquot the words alone appalled her quottruequot cunningham digested that quoti read about his milliondollar numbered account in switzerland and the liedetector tests he failed but in my experience theres always more how was he really uncoveredquot quotafter we got rick ames in 94 and the fbi arrested bob hanssen in 01 there was a feeling we were safe from traitors because wed put away our top two but langley wanted to be certain so we invited the fbi to help us create a computerized master grid of known and suspected leaks and breaches dating back into the early eighties the grids deep black by the way its existence not to be repeatedquot quotand the program turned up ticequot cunningham drank coffee quotexactly some of the worst violations couldnt be attributed to either ames or hanssen or any of the lesser traitors wed uncovered so we fed in the names of officers assignments and schedules tices name came up redflagged remember that blank between 1991 and 1999 when russian intelligence had no record of hanssen spying for them at all by then tice was selling out the storequot even after the cold war and the intense ideological rivalry ended the kremlins primary espionage target remained the united states as she sipped coffee she thought about jay tice when he was arrested in 2002 he was ddo second in power only to the director of central intelligence the dci he had access to many of the nations most closely held secrets his arrest had exploded in a spy scandal of global proportions blaring from headlines around the world for a year adrenaline shot through her quotwait a minute you need a hunter its an emergency for ticequot barculo sighed worriedly and sat back quothe escaped from prison early today with an inmate named frank theosopholis because this is national security the us marshals have no jurisdiction the dci cut a deal with the fbi so it still gets to conduct the prison investigation but the cia gets apprehension responsibility the dci handed it off to laurence litchfield and litchfield assigned it to us whippet we have a high success rate in underthetable missions plus were so covert were not even listed in langleys directories weve got only two days thats it if we fail the fbi takes over we must put tice and theosopholis back behind bars quickly and quietlyquot quotonly two daysquot quotgod knows what damage tice can do now that hes out again and langley needs no more black eyes with the public or congressquot quotagreedquot cunningham put confidence into her voice quotwell have to meet the deadline sooner would be better what have you done so farquot quotive sent people to surveil the russian embassy and tices old haunts were watching airports and train stations and car rental agencies weve staked out the storage locker he rented for the things he kept after he sold his house and were monitoring his last remaining bank account were following the same protocols for theosopholisquot quottheosopholis isnt a familiar name someone tice turned overseasquot quothes not in any of our active databases ive sent a request for copies of the old discs theosopholis has been serving time for killing a dea asset as soon as we have a dossier on theosopholis youll get a copy heres jay ticesquot she slid a fat file folder across the desk quothow did they escape from allenwoodquot quotwe dont know yet all weve got is that their prison cells were empty and both were missing they slipped past the guards the security cameras and the gates without tripping a single damn alarmquot the folder was two inches thick cunningham opened it inside were printouts photos and copies of clippings there was also a cd with tices name on it quotboth of them wouldve had phone access what about our ferret and rhyolite satellites the keyhole satellitesquot orbiting several thousand miles above the planet the football field150size antennae of the ferret and rhyolite satellites picked up talk flowing through ground lines all over the globe keyhole satellites could read a newspapers headlines from outer space as well as the thermal signatures of cars tanks buildings and people some had imaging lasers and could produce threedimensional replicas of what was on the ground right down to a wristwatch or a flight ticket quotwell have those reports todayquot barculo assured her quotif one of the keyholes had an orbit in the right position we might have images of them bunking out of allenwoodquot quotwe can hope but we cant wait ive got a plane standing by at andrews to fly you therequot quotgood do you have foretellquot based on promis software created in the late 1970s foretell was revolutionary the most sophisticated organizing and tracking and analytic program on the planet highly secret and possessed only by us intelligence and the military it could collate data at a speed beyond human capacity eliminate superfluous lines of inquiry then group it into patterns for analysis quotwe doquot quoti need to get some analysis started before i leavequot quotno go to allenwood firstquot barculo frowned quotweve lost enough timequot hunters were independents a difficult concept for some who were accustomed to issuing orders controlling her irritation cunningham stood up and said calmly quoti understand and thanks for the advice nevertheless my first stop has to be data analysisquot hannah barculo remained behind her desk a full ten seconds then she slapped the flats of her hands onto the top and pushed herself erect quotall right ill take youquot the hallway was still deserted and the house silent cunningham peered at the closed unmarked doors quotis the unit out looking for tice and theosopholis or is the whole place soundproofedquot quotbothquot barculo indicated a wide staircase quotyour office is on the second floor the last singleoccupancy i figured youd want to be alonequot she ignored the remark quotdid you know ticequot the whippet chief glanced at her surprised quotas a matter of fact i did a long time ago in the mideighties in west berlin my first overseas assignmentquot quotwhat did you think of himquot quothe was a hard one i never did meet anyone who felt like he truly knew him of course many of our people admired him really enjoyed him he had a way about him that was pure charm at the same time there were those who hated himquot she hesitated then confided quothe could be unreasonably demanding he always thought he knew best i have no idea how his poor wife put up with himquot she opened a door quotthis is itquot the room was as large as barculos office a continuous shelflike desk rimmed three walls on it were phones and keyboards and flatscreen monitors only one person was at work a man in his thirties wearing wirerimmed glasses and dressed in casual shirt and pants he peeled off headphones and looked up with a friendly smile barculo introduced them quotelaine cunningham meet mark silliphantquot quotyoure the hunterquot he asked quotsure am and i need your help can you access jay tices personnel recordsquot she set her purse and the dossier on the desk beside him as he started to shake his head barculo said quotill authorize itquot she leaned over his shoulder and whispered instructions silliphants fingers drummed the keyboard as cunningham paced across the parquet floor arms crossed planning at last he said quotokay im inquot she smiled quotgoodquot on the screen were jay tices name photo social security number and bureau of prisons register number quotextract every proper noun names cities countries buildings corporations that sort of thing and their descriptors then crossreference then organize by date and crossreference organize by location and crossreference again im looking for connections for instance maybe tice had a favorite caf142 in rome thats known for a certain dish or spice but that caf142 has moved to richmond virginia or he found a caf142 in richmond with that dish or spice next isolate people living or dead wherever tice was i want to know who was nearby but not necessarily or apparently in touch and what they were doing if possible i especially want to know where they are now and crossreference againquot silliphant did not look up quoti can sort for interactions they had on their own too away from tice if the informations available that isquot quotplease do there should also be a list of the various government and public databases in which he or his missions appear integrate thosequot foretell could integrate innumerable databases without requiring reprogramming no matter the code language used she looked at barculo quotwhatever you get on theosopholis id like mark to run the same sort of questions about himquot when barculo nodded she continued quotdo you have a wireless laptop i can borrow that way mark can send me his results and i can view the cd in tices filequot barculo opened a closet and removed a notebook computer and a titanium case she put the computer inside the case quotanything elsequot quotthanks thats itquot cunningham stowed the file folder on top and lowered the lid keyed in a code and locked it quoti wish i could stick around to work with mark but i agree with you i should get to allenwoodquot barculos grave eyes softened quotill lead you outquot they returned to the hall cunningham had not forgotten their earlier conversation she picked it up again quotwhy exactly did people dislike ticequot barculo thought about it quotsomething happened in 83 thatll give you an idea that summer he was running an undercover team i was on one of the new men got a tip that johannes weinrich was up to something in case you dont remember weinrich was one of carloss top lieutenants and in those days carlos the jackal was the worlds most wanted terrorist he was europes osama bin ladenquot quotso a bloodbath was likelyquot quotexactlyquot barculo opened what looked like an ordinary office door but inside was a deep broom closet with a vacuum cleaner and shelves loaded with cleaning supplies quotfollow mequot at the far end she opened a second door and walked out onto a stairwell landing lit by a single bulb the air smelled of mold and dust quotso what happenedquot cunningham prodded quotour new man slipped across into east berlin to follow weinrich but tice got wind of it and chased him down in some alley tice didnt believe him and he threatened to fire him for leaving without permission then he took him back to west berlin which left no one to keep tabs on weinrich a day later weinrich picked up nitropenta explosives and passed them on to two other terrorists they planted them in the maison de france in west berlin the blast was devastating it was a miracle only one person was killed the final tragedy was that the damn terrorists got away clean they escaped back into east berlin where the stasi protected themquot cunningham stared quotgood god how horriblequot quotyes an outrageous attack on civilians and the new man mightve been able to stop it if it hadnt been for jay ticequot barculo descended wood stairs into a dank cellar lined with brick cunningham followed quotwho was the new manquot at the bottom barculo turned nothing showed on her lined face quotlarry litchfieldquot quotlaurence litchfield our ddoquot the

careerquot she cracked open a door and a line of sunlight seeped in quotthis is our backup entrance use it whenever possible ive programmed a code for you and youll have to press your left thumb on

parked cars the morning light bathed the vehicles and houses in a deceptively rosy glow quotsee you soon hannahquot there was the briefest of smiles quotid rather see tice back in prison dont try anything fancy elaine remember you hunt we capture youre not trained to the degree we are and we dont want you to get hurt find him fast then phone mequot gripping the handle of the computers carrying case her purse slung over her shoulder elaine cunningham nodded and looked around carefully pulse racing she slipped outdoors and nonchalantly walked away
