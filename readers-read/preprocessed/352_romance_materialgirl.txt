 so this was what the proverbial rock bottom looked like and robin had splattered herself all over it it was humiliating enough to have been brought in at all much less wearing handcuffs but then they took all of her belongings including her belt made her spread her legs so a female guard could pat her down and when she was completely traumatized they took her picture fingerprinted her and told her to quit whining she was not going to see the sheriff she was going to see a judge okay she had said then fully contrite for her folly i give let me out they said they wouldif and when a judge said so and then they showed her the holding cell in which they had managed to defy physics and force at least a dozen women her bathroom was bigger than that cell it was a nightmare a bonafide unmistakable nightmare complete with bodies under the benches and scary monstertype looking humans and damn it robin could not stop shiveringthey had turned the air conditioning on to a full metal jacket high undoubtedly to keep the stench down how long she sat there she had no idea and wouldnt have been the least surprised if days had passed maybe even weeks until the door was at last pushed open and a guard came waddling in all right ladiestime to go you know the drill everyone on their feet well no she didnt know the drill but robin surged to her feet nonetheless crowding with the others to get out of that stuffy little room they were lead to an open area with chairs and a bank of phones along one wall and told to make their calls robin went to a phone picked up the receiver grimaced at the greasy feel of it and debated who to call oh hi this is robin and im in jail her attorney seemed logical but noshe was also evans attorney mia rightshe didnt answer the phone before noon lucy well sure if she wanted it spread all over houston kelly mariah linda ceciliagod no her cpa hed probably have a heart attack that left only one viable option grimacing robin dialed her grandparents number praying to high heaven they hadnt gone off on some trailer trip grandma answered the phone on the first ring hellooh she sang grandma its me she said low oh hi honey grandma said cheerfully grandma now dont freak out okay i need you to come pick me up or get a lawyernot my lawyer butoh hell im not sure what i need you to do a lawyer grandma gasped why on earth would you need a lawyer and what is all that racket its a really long and stupid story grandma butokay listen im sort of in a bind you shouldnt panic or anything because like i said its really really stupid where are you robbie grandma asked her voice becoming shriller ugh there was no good way to say this was there she forced a laugh you wont believe this grandma ha haaaa imimin jail they probably heard her grandmothers shriek throughout the entire retirement community jail she cried out jail oh no not jail elmer robbie is in jaaaail robin heard the receiver on her grandmothers end bounce on the phone table grandma she cried into the phone robbie is that you thank god grandpa yes yes its me grandpa is grandma all right are you really in jail yes i oh yea whatd you do i didnt really do drugs grandpa of course it wasnt drugs well then what murder he chuckled appreciatively at his own jest robin stared at the phone cradle in front of her why hadnt she realized before this crucial moment that her grandparents were insane oh dear it wasnt murder was it he asked his voice suddenly anxious of course not she snapped its too long to explain now but grandpa please come get me this place is horrible everyone smells and who knows why they are here and the guards are justjust mean and i have no idea how long they will hold me or anything but please please come get me she said feeling suddenly and dangerously close to tears well of course well come get you robbiegirl you just hold tight were gonna come get you thanks grandpa she whispered tearfully and heard him shout at grandma to hurry up as the phone clicked off feeling a little better having called in the cavalry robin endured another interminable wait until they were led single file into another long room where a judges bench was elevated above the rows of wooden benches they formed two groups men and women on opposite sides of the room now robin was feeling particularly slimy the last 72 hours had been a personal trip through hell and all she wanted was outshe had never felt so alone or so vulnerable in her life she shivered they waited she wondered what time it was had that lightheaded feeling of having flown through too many time zones on a long transatlantic flight slow and thick when at last the judge did arrive robin was surprised the diminutive africanamerican probably didnt reach five feet the bailiff announced judge vaneta jobe and told them all to rise judge jobe climbed up onto her big black highback leather chair and with her head barely visible and her feet probably swinging a foot above ground let her gaze travel the crowd all right then she said slipping on a pair of round silverframed glasses listen up everyone yall have some rights youll need to know about she proceeded to inform them in a booming voice that belied her size of their rights and the different types of bonds available to them then she announced she would bring them forward to hear the charges being made against them and when she had finished her speech she asked is that just clear as mud lets begin mr peeples the bailiff picked up a sheet and squinted at it rodney trace a man from the third row of benches stood and came forward his head hung low when he approached the bench judge jobe glared down at him seems like you gone and done a stupid thing mr trace how many times are you gonna be stupid until you kill someone or until they send you down to the farm rodney trace shrugged judge jobe sighed bail set at 25000 whos next on our hit parade mr peeples horrified robin watched as judge jobe and a long string of people who alternately tried to argue their charge or took whatever bond she set with a shrug she was beginning to feel less and less optimistic about what would happen to her and started like a jumping bean when the bailiff finally called her name she hurried forward clasped her hands tightly in front of her and tried very hard not to shiver the judge leaned over the bench to have a better look at her shaking her head um um umdont know whats got into you girlfriend she said and picked up a vanilla folder do you think this town belongs to you was she supposed to answer that robin glanced uneasily at the bailiff uhno she stammered no of course not of course not hmmm that why you were so nasty to officer denton i uhi ddidnt know that i was the judge peered over the tops of her round glasses at robin you trying to tell me that you didnt know you were mouthing off to him or that you were being nasty or that by refusing to give him your name or provide your license or proof of insurance that you were being disrespectful is that the way you do people ms lear no no uh yeswell no robin stuttered the judge snorted looked at the bailiff ms lear got herself an attitude problem mr peeples that superior attitude got her into a little bit of trouble didnt it it sure did your honor im surprised ms lear managed to make it this long before someone knocked her down a notch or two the judge tossed the file down and bestowed a fierce frown on robin that sent another shiver down her spine now look here you need to wake up and smell the coffee girl how many of your fine and fancy friends get themselves thrown in jail for talking trash ii dont know any robin answered truthfully maybe thats cause they dont go around thinking they are better than everyone else if youre gonna walk around thinking you are youre gonna keep making trouble for yourself do you understand me i dont think im better i said do you understand me judge jobe demanded yes maam robin answered softly im gonna accept your plea of guilty for driving without a license or insurance and fine you 750 for wasting my time robin blinked wondered when exactly she had pled guilty now follow the deputy here and try not to be annoying the judge said and handed the deputy a piece of paper he pointed toward the door robin walked head down and found herself waiting in another large room after she had received her personal property which consisted of a belt a cartier watch an emerald ring and a halfempty purse in which fortunately there had been a lone credit card in the side pocket the very helpful deputies also gave her a paper with the location of her car and pointed to the window where she would pay her fine along with everyone else in houston robin made the mistake of asking the clerk when she could pay which earned her a reprimand to be seated while the clerk and her friend chatted away as if they had nothing else to do dejected exhausted and feeling terribly low robin sat wondering if it was possible to get a bazooka in there to break up their little coffee club her head ached her back ached even her butt ached from sitting for so many hours on rock hard benches like the one on which she was sitting now she felt grimy in clothes she had now worn for almost twentyfour hours her mouth tasted rank and her stomach was in knots all she wanted to do was go home and burrow under the covers of her bed for the next five months miserable feeling sorrier for herself with each passing minute she waited it wasnt until someone sat hard next to her jostling her almost off the bench that she realized she must have been drifting on the edge of sleep with a jump robin blinked looked to her left a man with impossibly broad shoulders had fallen onto the bench next to her he was wearing a weathered leather jacket and faded jeans had a crop of thick dark brown hair and when he turned to look at robin he smiled and said with a wink hey exhausted all robin saw was someone rude enough to knock into her and seeing as how she had endured enough for one span of twenty four hours thank you very much she did not appreciate it in the least get real she muttered shooting him an icecold look and scooched over god whatd i say hey she snapped oh come on it cant be that bad he remarked as if they were sitting in a park somewhere what would you know okay so im sorry i didnt mean to bump into you truce oh no oh nononooo she wasnt about to engage excuse me she said coolly but im really not in the mood to make friends just now with her hand she gestured for him to move justgo away believe me lady id love to oblige you he said his voice less friendly but in case you havent noticed its pretty crowded in here you can find another seat maybe youd like to find another seat ive been waiting two hours two hours how did he get out so fast that infuriated robinshe had to wait all night and this dude was out in two hours i was here first she insisted petulantly ah he said nodding clearly i misunderstood but instead of moving he just settled in robin glared at him what do you think you are doing like i said the room is full so unless you can produce a deed or something that proves you own this bench im not going anywhere oh my god robin exclaimed indignantly and abruptly stood up nice talking to you miss congeniality he said as she started to push her way down the row shut up she barked over her shoulder three or four seats down she glared at two hispanic men who after exchanging a wary glance with one another moved to make a seat for her she squished in between them like a sardine then glanced down the row just as the jailbird got up and sauntered off bastard but lordwhat a saunter that bastard had even in her dejected repulsed and generally miserable state robin could not help noticing how fine he was in his ancient denim jeans and briefly wondered what he might have done to land himself in hell but quickly stopped when he turned abruptly and caught her staring at his backside he flashed her a lopsided knewit smile robin frowned deeply turned her attention forward and did not look again except once maybe twice by the time they finally called her name she had definitely lost sight of him and was in such a hurry to get out of that stinking hellhole that she almost collided with him when she turned from the window clutching her freedom on a receipt marked paid he was standing in line just behind her robin gave a little shriek of surprise and quickly jumped back a foot or more oh man well hello again sunshine he drawled jesus she exclaimed heatedly holding the hand with the receipt over her flailing heart as she glared up at him cant you take a hint hey your majesty im just waiting in line like everyone else uhhuh right robin responded irritably and wondered for a split second why men thought women were so ignorant of their motives you know if i were you id be worrying about my new cellmate instead of trying to get a date the man all but choked he stared down at her his copper brown eyes wide with surprise and then he laughed laughed laughed so roundly as if that was so hilariously preposterous that several heads turned in their direction but he didnt seem to carehe leaned forward bent his head until his mouth was just an inch or two from her cheek and said sunshine youre cute he paused lingered there for a tiny moment his breath warm on her face so close that she could smell his cheap but not altogether unpleasant cologne but no way are you that cute and youre mean he straightened up you know if i were you he said mimicking her voice id see someone about that rod stuck up my butt with that he calmly stepped around her to the payment window okay well she was now officially in hell some jail guy had just dissed her and it was so unbearably humiliating that robin beat a hasty retreat out the double glass doors into the lobby of the processing center clutching her purse and her receipts like a mad escapee frantically searching the milling crowd for her grandparents fortunately her mothers parents were easy to spot there was her grandfather who had the distinct misfortune to have been named elmer and the even greater misfortune in his declining years of actually resembling elmer he was round and squat with hugely enormous feet typically encased in white easy spirits which heralded his arrival a good city block before him and in fact it was mr fudds shoes robin saw in the lobby before she saw him her grandmother lil was the physical opposite of elmer she was tall and reed thin and wore big pinkrimmed octagonal glasses that covered her cheeks and eyebrows and made her eyes look like big blue stop signs she also wore easy spirits the taupe ones grandma spotted robin and came hurrying like a squirrel across the lobby darting in and around people in her haste to get to her granddaughter robbie she exclaimed and grabbed her in a bear hold nearly squeezing the breath from her oh my god sweet pea what has happened robbiegirl you all right grandpa asked rescuing her from grandmas grip im fine robin insisted its really so stupid ill tell you all about it in the car but please lets just get out of here she urged ushering them in the direction of the door grandpa had scored a prime parking spot into which he had maneuvered his chevy expedition an suv the size of a small condo robin gratefully crawled into the cavernous back seat buckle in hon now are we going to hear what you did grandma insisted fastening her seat belt best to get it over i got stopped for speeding speeding where grandpa insisted on 610 well now 610 thats just a death trap and i guess i sort of mouthed off a little i mean i wasnt doing any faster than anyone else and i told the cop so thats my girl grandpa said proudly as he coasted out of the parking lot so he asked me for my license and registration but the thing is i had left them on my desk at workby the way grandpa i need to go by my office and get my wallet okay anyway i didnt have my license or registration and suddenly im a criminal so the cop told me to step out of the car andwell i just thoughti just thought that he was overreacting and i shouldnt have to step out of the car well he should have taken your word for it grandma said with an indignant nod of her head surely when you told him your name he ran some sort of check or whatever they do in their cars to make sure you werent lying robin squirmed grandma swiveled sharply to look at her well demanded grandma didnt he robin sighed leaned her head against a headrest covered with a pink baby tshirt i was really tired and really cranky and i didnt exactly tell him who i was i just sort of thought it wasnt his business so he arrested me grandpa gave a shout of laughter but grandma threw a hand over her mouth and stared at robin in horror for a moment can they do that apparently she answered dryly he arrested me for failure to identify myself driving without a license and driving without insurance oh my goodness what does this mean grandma asked robin grimaced at her grandmothers look of shock and turned away to the window where cars where swerving from behind grandpa and whizzing past as he pushed the suv up to 60 it means they convicted me of a class c misdemeanor took 750 dollars for their trouble and told me to go home elmer this is no joking matter i didnt think that was joking grandpa dont forget to go by my office okay grandpa acknowledged her request by putting his blinker on a good two or three miles before their exit well you cant work today grandma said in a huff you dont want everyone knowing why you were lateaaron wouldnt like that at all honestly robin didnt know anymore maybe dad would think she deserved to be publicly humiliated i just need to get my things and a couple of files thats all maybe grandpa can go in for me robin said absently i just cant believe you have been arrested grandma said and shook her head again too exhausted to think robin stared out the window felt her eyelids growing heavy the next thing she heard was grandpa saying uhoh looks like a fire robin opened her eyes and glanced out the front windshield as her mind began to grasp that they were on the street of her office she suddenly grabbed the back of grandpas seat oh my god she cried it couldnt be couldnt be robin quickly counted the floors of her office building and felt her heart sink to her toes oh yes it could be and it was the lti offices were on fire her office was on fire in front of her grandpa shook his head some fool probably left a cigarette burning or a computer on or something like that he opined disgusted left something on the suggestion was suddenly clawing at robins throat choking her the coffeepot she had left the coffeepot on
