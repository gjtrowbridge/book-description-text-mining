 fairy tales are more than true not because they tell us that dragons exist but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten gk chesterton chapter one coraline discovered the door a little while after they moved into the house it was a very old house it had an attic under the roof and a cellar under the ground and an overgrown garden with huge old trees in it coralines family didnt own all of the house it was too big for that instead they owned part of it there were other people who lived in the old house miss spink and miss forcible lived in the flat below coralines on the ground floor they were both old and round and they lived in their flat with a number of ageing highland terriers who had names like hamish and andrew and jock once upon a time miss spink and miss forcible had been actresses as miss spink told coraline the first time she met her you see caroline miss spink said getting coralines name wrong both myself and miss forcible were famous actresses in our time we trod the boards luvvy oh dont let hamish eat the fruit cake or hell be up all night with his tummy its coraline not caroline coraline said coraline in the flat above coralines under the roof was a crazy old man with a big moustache he told coraline that he was training a mouse circus he wouldnt let anyone see it one day little caroline when they are all ready everyone in the whole world will see the wonders of my mouse circus you ask me why you cannot see it now is that what you asked me no said coraline quietly i asked you not to call me caroline its coraline the reason you cannot see the mouse circus said the man upstairs is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed also they refuse to play the songs i have written for them all the songs i have written for the mice to play go oompah oompah but the white mice will only play toodle oodle like that i am thinking of trying them on different types of cheese coraline didnt think there really was a mouse circus she thought the old man was probably making it up the day after they moved in coraline went exploring she explored the garden it was a big garden at the very back was an old tennis court but noone in the house played tennis and the fence around the court had holes in it and the net had mostly rotted away there was an old rose garden filled with stunted flyblown rosebushes there was a rockery that was all rocks there was a fairy ring made of squidgy brown toadstools which smelled dreadful if you accidentally trod on them there was also a well miss spink and miss forcible made a point of telling coraline how dangerous the well was on the first day coralines family moved in and warned her to be sure she kept away from it so coraline set off to explore for it so that she knew where it was to keep away from it properly she found it on the third day in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court behind a clump of trees a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass the well had been covered up by wooden boards to stop anyone falling in there was a small knothole in one of the boards and coraline spent an afternoon dropping pebbles and acorns through the hole and waiting and counting until she heard the plop as they hit the water far below coraline also explored for animals she found a hedgehog and a snakeskin but no snake and a rock that looked just like a frog and a toad that looked just like a rock there was also a haughty black cat who would sit on walls and tree stumps and watch her but would slip away if ever she went over to try to play with it that was how she spent her first two weeks in the house exploring the garden and the grounds her mother made her come back inside for dinner and for lunch and coraline had to make sure she dressed up warm before she went out for it was a very cold summer that year but go out she did exploring every day until the day it rained when coraline had to stay inside what should i do asked coraline read a book said her mother watch a video play with your toys go and pester miss spink or miss forcible or the crazy old man upstairs no said coraline i dont want to do those things i want to explore i dont really mind what you do said coralines mother as long as you dont make a mess coraline went over to the window and watched the rain come down it wasnt the kind of rain you could go out in it was the other kind the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed it was rain that meant business and currently its business was turning the garden into a muddy wet soup coraline had watched all the videos she was bored with her toys and shed read all her books she turned on the television she went from channel to channel to channel but there was nothing on but men in suits talking about the stock market and schools programmes eventually she found something to watch it was the last half of a natural history programme about something called protective coloration she watched animals birds and insects which disguised themselves as leaves or twigs or other animals to escape from things that could hurt them she enjoyed it but it ended too soon and was followed by a programme about a cake factory it was time to talk to her father coralines father was home both of her parents worked doing things on computers which meant that they were home a lot of the time each of them had their own study
