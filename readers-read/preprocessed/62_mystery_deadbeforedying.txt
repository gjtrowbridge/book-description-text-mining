 1 in the afternoon hush of the last day of the year mat joubert thought about death mechanically his hands were busy cleaning his service pistol the z88 he sat in his sitting room leaning forward in the armchair the parts of the pistol lying on the coffee table in front of him among rags brushes and an oil can a cigarette in the ashtray sent up a long thin plume of smoke above him at the window a bee flew against the glass with monotonous regularity in an irritating attempt to reach the summer afternoon outside where a light southeaster was blowing joubert didn8217t hear it his mind wandered aimlessly through memories of the past weeks among chronicles of death his bread and butter the white woman on her back on the kitchen floor spatula in her right hand omelet burnt on the stove the blood an added splash of color in the pleasant room in the living room the boy nineteen in tears 3240 rand in the pocket of his leather jacket saying over and over his mother8217s name the man among the flowers an easier memory death with dignity he recalled the detectives and the uniformed men on the open industrial site between the gray factory buildings they stood in a circle kneedeep in the wildflowers thrusting up yellow and white and orange heads in the center of this judicial circle lay the body of a middleaged man small in stature an empty bottle of meths was gripped in one hand he was facedown cheek against the soil but his eyes were closed and his other hand clutched a few flowers now faded it was the hands that mat joubert remembered most vividly on macassar beach three people the stench of burning rubber and charred flesh still hanging in the air the group of the law and the media forming a barrier downwind against the horror of multiple necklace murders the hands claws reaching up to the heavens in a petrified plea for deliverance mat joubert was tired of living but he didn8217t want to die like that using thumb and forefinger he placed the fifteen stubby 9 mm bullets into the magazine one by one the last one flashed briefly in the afternoon sun he held the bullet at eye level balanced between thumb and forefinger and stared at the rustcolored lead point what would it be like if you pressed the dark mouth of the z88 softly against your lips and you pulled the trigger carefully slowly respectfully would you feel the lead projectile pain would thoughts still flash through the undamaged portions of the brain accuse you of cowardice just before the night enveloped you or did it all happen so quickly that the sound of the shot wouldn8217t even travel from gun to ear to brain he wondered had it been like that for lara what was it like8212her light being switched off and watching the hand on the switch what did she think about in that last fleeting moment life him perhaps she felt remorse and wanted to give a last mocking laugh he didn8217t want to think about it a new year would start the following day there were people out there with resolutions and dreams and plans and enthusiasm and hope for this new era and here he sat tomorrow everything at work would be different the new man the political appointment the others could talk about nothing else joubert didn8217t really care he no longer wanted to know either about death or life it was simply one more thing to survive to take account of to squeeze the spirit out of life and lure the great predator even closer he banged the magazine into the stock with the flat of his left hand as if violence would give his thoughts a new direction he thrust the weapon into its leather sheath the oil and the rags went back into the old shoebox he dragged on the cigarette blew the smoke in the direction of the window then he saw the bee heard exhaustion diminishing the sound of the wings joubert got up pulled the lace curtain aside and opened the window the bee felt the warm breeze outside but still tried to find a way out through the wrong panel joubert turned picked up an oily rag and carefully swiped it past the window the insect hovered briefly in front of the opening then flew outside joubert closed the window and straightened the curtain he could also escape he thought if he wanted to deliberately he let this perception fade as well but it was enough to have him make an impulsive decision he8217d walk across to the neighborhood barbecue this evening just for a while for the old year
