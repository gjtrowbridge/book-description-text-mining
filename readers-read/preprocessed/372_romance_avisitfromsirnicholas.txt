lady elizabeth effington stared at the words shed just written and grimaced no affectionately was entirely too personal and lizzie too informal hed never called her lizzie and she doubted hed start now indeed with one signifi cant exception hed never been anything other than completely proper with her it was most annoying she crossed out the line just as she had the previous three attempts that was truly wonderful behind her her younger sister juliana sighed with heartfelt satisfaction i knew you would like it lizzie said absently and stared at the sheet of white velum lying on the desk in front of her in the sitting room she shared with jules it was so so jules thought for a moment wonderful quite lizzie murmured and wrote with sincere best wishes lady elizabeth effington no more than wonderful i daresay its the best story about christmas no the best story about anything i have ever read that wasnt right either with sincere best wishes had an obligatory ring as if one were writing to an elderly relative one didnt particularly like but was required to be pleasant to nonetheless besides while lizzie might be too personal lady elizabeth effington was far and away too formal for her purposes she slashed a pen stroke through the bothersome phrase in point of fact jules continued in a tone that sounded far more like a literary critic than a mere girl of sixteen years i think its quite the best story mr dickens has written of those ive read of course but i do think ive read most of his stories as he is possibly my favorite author its not as amusing as nicholas nickleby but a far better ending to my mind than the old curiosity shop although i do so love stories about girls having adventures jules paused even if little nells were rather dreadful yes well dying at the end of ones story does tend to make ones adventures a bit less than cheery lizzie said under her breath with eternal friendship elizabeth i dislike books that dont end well mothers books always end well this one does too in a fashion although it is something of a pity scrooge did not discover the error of his ways until he was old he would have had a rather wonderful life if he had married belle dont you think so um hmm friendship was good not the least bit improper and elizabeth had the right tone perhaps lizzie sighed and crossed out her latest effort why on earth was this so blasted diffi cult all she was trying to do was come up with an appropriate inscription for a book to give as a gift still her words were as important as the book itself even more so i think my very favorite part though jules said slowly was at the end when tiny tim sprouted wings and flew off with fezziwig and the ghost of christmas past dont you agree yes of course i lizzie jerked her head up swiveled in her chair and stared at her sister what did you say i suspected as much jules narrowed her eyes suspiciously you werent listening to a word i said were you i most certainly was you said lizzie searched her mind she did so hate to admit that her sister was right at least in part you said you liked a christmas carol better than any of mr dickenss other works jules snorted in a most unladylike manner that was the very least of what i said she sat upright on the chaise and craned her neck to see around her sister whatever are you doing anyway lizzie shifted to shield the paper on the desk and adopted a casual tone nothing of importance really just trying to find the right words jules raised a brow for what for none of your concern thats what lizzie said firmly is it something for charles jules fluttered her lashes in an exaggerated manner lizzie laughed no its not and even if it was i wouldnt tell you why not indignation sounded in the younger girls voice id tell you what iwas giving the gentleman who was about to ask for my hand in marriage nonsense lizzie said quickly charles is not about to ask for my hand jules smirked would you care to wager on that lizzie stared at her sister unease settling in the pit of her stomach do you know something i should know perhaps jules settled back on the chaise and smiled at her sister in that irritating way younger girls refine for the express purpose of torturing their older sisters i might know that charles spoke to father privately this morning and i might further know when charles came out of fathers library he had a look of relief and excitement on his face lizzie waved off her sisters comments that could mean anything oh come now lizzie you cant be the least bit surprised by this jules studied her sister curiously for as long as i can remember everyone in both our families has expected a match between you i rather thought you expected to marry him as well charles is a good man and an excellent match and any woman would be honored to be his wife indeed it seems to me there are any number of young women wishing to do just that lizzie smiled in a noncommittal manner and hoped her comments would satisfy her sister i know i would charles is wonderful jules heaved a heartfelt sigh hes so handsome with the brightest blue eyes and the merriest smile and the most charming manner indeed i fear i have a penchant for men with blond wavy hair one is hardpressed to keep from running ones fingers through it
