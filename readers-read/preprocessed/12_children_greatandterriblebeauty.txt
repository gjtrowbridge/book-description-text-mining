 chapter one june 21 1895 bombay india quotplease tell me thats not going to be part of my birthday dinner this eveningquot i am staring into the hissing face of a cobra a surprisingly pink tongue slithers in and out of a cruel mouth while an indian man whose eyes are the blue of blindness inclines his head toward my mother and explains in hindi that cobras make very good eating my mother reaches out a whitegloved finger to stroke the snakes back quotwhat do you think gemma now that youre sixteen will you be dining on cobraquot the slithery thing makes me shudder quoti think not thank youquot the old blind indian man smiles toothlessly and brings the cobra closer its enough to send me reeling back where i bump into a wooden stand filled with little statues of indian deities one of the statues a woman who is all arms with a face bent on terror falls to the ground kali the destroyer lately mother has accused me of keeping her as my unofficial patron saint lately mother and i havent been getting on very well she claims its because ive reached an impossible age i state emphatically to anyone who will listen that its all because she refuses to take me to london quoti hear in london you dont have to defang your meals firstquot i say were moving past the cobra man and into the throng of people crowding every inch of bombays frenzied marketplace mother doesnt answer but waves away an organgrinder and his monkey its unbearably hot beneath my cotton dress and crinolines sweat streaks down my body the fliesmy most ardent admirersdart about my face i swat at one of the little winged beasts but it escapes and i can almost swear i hear it mocking me my misery is reaching epidemic proportions overhead the clouds are thick and dark giving warning that this is monsoon season when floods of rain could fall from the sky in a matter of minutes in the dusty bazaar the turbaned men chatter and squawk and bargain lifting brightly colored silks toward us with brown sunbaked hands everywhere there are carts lined with straw baskets offering every sort of ware and ediblethin coppery vases wooden boxes carved into intricate flower designs and mangos ripening in the heat quothow much farther to mrs talbots new house couldnt we please take a carriagequot i ask with what i hope is a noticeable annoyance quotits a nice day for a walk and ill thank you to keep a civil tonequot my annoyance has indeed been noted sarita our longsuffering housekeeper offers pomegranates in her leathery hand quotmemsahib these are very nice perhaps we will take them to your father yesquot if i were a good daughter id bring some to my father watch his blue eyes twinkle as he slices open the rich red fruit then eats the tiny seeds with a silver spoon just like a proper british gentleman quothell only stain his white suitquot i grumble my mother starts to say something to me thinks better of it sighsas usual we used to go everywhere together my mother and ivisiting ancient temples exploring local customs watching hindu festivals staying up late to see the streets bloom with candlelight now she barely takes me on social calls its as if im a leper without a colony quothe will stain his suit he always doesquot i mumble in my defense though no one is paying me a bit of attention except for the organgrinder and his monkey theyre following my every step hoping to amuse me for money the high lace collar of my dress is soaked with perspiration i long for the cool lush green of england which ive only read about in my grandmothers letters letters filled with gossip about tea dances and balls and who has scandalized whom half a world away while i am stranded in boring dusty india watching an organgrinders monkey do a juggling trick with dates the same trick hes been performing for a year quotlook at the monkey memsahib how adorable he isquot sarita says this as if i were still three and clinging to the bottoms of her sari skirts no one seems to understand that i am fully sixteen and want no need to be in london where i can be close to the museums and the balls and men who are older than six and younger than sixty quotsarita that monkey is a trained thief who will be begging for your wages in a momentquot i say with a sigh as if on cue the furry urchin scrambles up and sits on my shoulder with his palm outstretched quothow would you like to end up in a birthday stewquot i tell him through clenched teeth the monkey hisses mother grimaces at my ill manners and drops a coin in its owners cup the monkey grins triumphantly and leaps across my head before running away a vendor holds out a carved mask with snarling teeth and elephant ears without a word mother places it over her face quotfind me if you canquot she says its a game shes played with me since i could walka bit of hideandseek meant to make me smile a childs game quoti see only my motherquot i say bored quotsame teeth same earsquot mother gives the mask back to the vendor ive hit her vanity her weak point quotand i see that turning sixteen is not very becoming to my daughterquot she says quotyes i am sixteen sixteen an age at which most decent girls have been sent for schooling in londonquot i give the word decent an extra push hoping to appeal to some maternal sense of shame and propriety quotthis looks a bit on the green side i thinkquot shes peering intently at a mango her fruit inspection is allconsuming quotno one tried to keep tom imprisoned in bombayquot i say invoking my brothers name as a last resort quothes had four whole years there and now hes starting at universityquot quotits different for menquot quotits not fair ill never have a season ill end up a spinster with hundreds of cats who all drink milk from china bowlsquot im whining its unattractive but i find im powerless to stop quoti seequot mother says finally quotwould you like to be paraded around the ballrooms of london society like some prize horse there to have its breeding capabilities evaluated would you still think london was so charming when you were the subject of cruel gossip for the slightest infraction of the rules londons not as idyllic as your grandmothers letters make it out to bequot quoti wouldnt know ive never seen itquot quotgemma quot mothers tone is all warning even as her smile is constant for the indians mustnt let them think we british ladies are so petty as to indulge in arguments on the streets we only discuss the weather and when the weather is bad we pretend not to notice sarita chuckles nervously quothow is it that memsahib is now a young lady it seems only yesterday you were in the nursery oh look dates your favoritequot she breaks into a gaptoothed smile that makes every deeply etched wrinkle in her face come alive its hot and i suddenly want to scream to run away from everything and everyone ive ever known quotthose dates are probably rotting on the inside just like indiaquot quotgemma that will be quite enoughquot mother fixes me with her glassgreen eyes penetrating and wise people call them i have the same large upturned green eyes the indians say they are unsettling disturbing like being watched by a ghost sarita smiles down at her feet keeps her hands busy adjusting her brown sari i feel a tinge of guilt for saying such a nasty thing about her home our home though i dont really feel at home anywhere these days quotmemsahib you do not want to go to london it is gray and cold and there is no ghee for bread you wouldnt like itquot a train screams into the depot down near the glittering bay bombay good bay it means though i cant think of anything good about it right now a dark plume of smoke from the train stretches up touching the heavy clouds mother watches it rise quotyes cold and grayquot she places a hand on her throat fingers the necklace hanging there a small silver medallion of an allseeing eye atop a crescent moon a gift from a villager mother said her goodluck charm ive never seen her without it sarita puts a hand on mothers arm quottime to go memsahibquot mother pulls her gaze away from the train drops her hand from her necklace quotyes come well have a lovely time at mrs talbots im sure shell have lovely cakes just for your birthdayquot a man in a white turban and thick black traveling cloak stumbles into her from behind bumping her hard quota thousand pardons honorable ladyquot he smiles offers a deep bow to excuse his rudeness when he does he reveals a young man behind him wearing the same sort of strange cloak for a moment the young man and i lock eyes he isnt much older than i am probably seventeen if a day with brown skin a full mouth and the longest eyelashes i have ever seen i know im not supposed to find indian men attractive but i dont see many young men and i find im blushing in spite of myself he breaks our gaze and cranes his neck to see over the hordes quotyou should be more carefulquot sarita barks at the older man threatening him with a blow from her arm quotyou better not be a thief or you will be punishedquot quotno no memsahib only i am terribly clumsyquot he drops his smile and with it the cheerful simpleton routine he whispers low to my mother in perfectly accented english quotcirce is nearquot it makes no sense to me just the ramblings of a very clever thief said to distract us i start to say as much to my mother but the look of sheer panic on her face stops me cold her eyes are wild as she whips around and scans the crowded streets like shes looking for a lost child
