the wild child of parrish mississippi had come back to the town shed left behind forever sugar beth carey gazed from the rainslicked windshield to the horrible dog who lay beside her on the passenger seat i know what youre thinking gordon so go ahead and say it how the mighty have fallen right she gave a bitter laugh well screw you just she blinked her eyes against a sting of tears just screw you gordon lifted his head and sneered at her he thought she was trash not me pal she turned up the heater on her ancient volvo against the chill of the late february day griffin and diddie carey ruled this town and i was their princess the girl most likely to set the world on fire she heard an imaginary howl of basset hound laughter like the row of tinroofed houses shed just passed sugar beth had grown a little shabby at the edges the long blond hair that swirled to her shoulders didnt gleam as brightly as it once had and the tiny gold hearts at her earlobes no longer skipped in a carefree dance her pouty lips had lost the urge to curl in flirtatious smiles and her baby doll cheeks had given up their innocence three husbands ago thick lashes still framed a pair of amazing clear blue eyes but a delicate tracing of lines had begun to make tiny fishtails at the corners fifteen years earlier shed been the bestdressed girl in parrish but now one of her calfhigh stilettoheeled boots had a small hole in the sole and her scarlet bodyhugging knit dress with its demure turtleneck and notsodemure hemline had come from a discount store instead of a pricey boutique parrish had begun its life in the 1820s as a northeastern mississippi cotton town and later escaped the torches of the occupying union army thanks to the wiles of its female population whod showered the boys in blue with such unrelenting charm and indefatigable southern hospitality that none of them had the heart to strike the first match sugar beth was a direct descendant of those women but on days like this she had a tough time remembering it she adjusted the windshield wipers as she approached shorty smith road and gazed toward the twostory building empty on this sunday afternoon that still sat at the end thanks to her fathers economic blackmail parrish high school stood as one of the deep souths few successful experiments with integrated public education once shed ruled those hallways she alone had decided who sat at the best table in the cafeteria which boys were acceptable to date and whether an imitation gucci purse was okay if your daddy wasnt griffin carey and you couldnt afford the real thing blond and divine shed reigned supreme she hadnt always been a benevolent dictator but her power had seldom been challenged not even by the teachers one of them had tried but sugar beth had made short work of that as for winnie davis what chance did a clumsy insecure geek have against the power and might of sugar beth carey as she gazed through the february drizzle at the high school the old music began to drum in her head inxs miami sound machine prince in those days when elton john sang candle in the wind hed only been singing of marilyn high school the last time shed owned the world gordon farted god i hate you you miserable dog gordons scornful expression told her he didnt give a damn these days neither did she she checked the gas gauge she was running on fumes but she didnt want to waste money filling the tank until she had to looking on the bright side who needed gas when shed reached the end of the road she turned the corner and saw the empty lot marking the place where ryans house had once stood ryan galantine had been ken to her barbie the most popular boy the most popular girl luv u 4ever shed broken his heart their freshman year at ole miss when shed screwed around on him with darren tharp the star athlete whod become her first husband sugar beth remembered the way winnie davis used to look at ryan when she didnt think anyone was watching as if a clumsy outcast had a chance with a dazzler like ryan galantine sugar beths group of friends the seawillows had wet their pants laughing at her behind her back the memory depressed her even further as she drove toward the center of town she saw that parrish had capitalized on its newfound fame as the setting and leading character of the nonfiction bestseller last whistlestop on the nowhere line the new visitors bureau had attracted a steady stream of tourists and she could see the town had spruced itself up the sidewalk in front of the presbyterian church no longer buckled and the ugly streetlights shed grown up with had been replaced with charming turnofthecentury lampposts along tyler street the historic antebellum victorian and greek revival homes sported fresh coats of paint and a jaunty copper weathervane graced the cupola of miss eulie bakers italianate monstrosity sugar beth and ryan had made out in the alley behind that house the night before theyd gone all the way she turned onto broadway the towns fourblock main street the courthouse clock was no longer frozen at ten past ten and the fountain in the park had shed its grime the bank along with a half dozen other businesses sported maroon and green striped awnings and the confederate flag was nowhere in sight
