 1 coffee break on a friday morning in early december naomi wechsler walked up seventh avenue head bent slightly forward umbrella positioned in front of her like a shield it was wet and sleety and the umbrella kept getting pulled inside out by gusts brief but sharp of winter wind still naomi prevailed she was on her way to holy name of jesus hospital for her morning in the pediatric ward and she didnt want to get soaked the three mornings a week she spent at holy name had become the scaffolding on which her days were precariously balanced naomi was scrupulous about honoring her commitment there in some small way it was what kept her going rick her husband didnt understand why she wanted no needed to go to holy name he had asked her about it repeatedly and when her answers failed to satisfy him he had begun a quiet but penetrating campaign of reproach small exasperated sighs and looks a certain clipped tone when he asked if she was going up there again but then it seemed that there were so many ways in which she had failed rick these days so many ways she could hardly count them and he had failed her too still she had resolved not to think about that today she would not let herself as naomi came to the corner of sixth street she checked her watch only a little past nine she was not due to arrive until ninethirty she decided to duck into barnes noble to buy a cup of coffee from the caf there was free coffee on the ward and coffee sold in the hospital cafeteria but naomi knew from experience that the former was flavorless and cold the latter flavorless and hot she had a little extra time this morning she could indulge shaking the excess water from her umbrella she folded it up before stepping inside the double doors of the bookstore quickly she made her way to the caf and got on line to her left was a table with a large display of godiva chocolates gold boxes tied with red ribbon and adorned with pinecones the same gold boxes tied with blue ribbon and adorned with silver stars christmas and hanukkah the december twins had arrived in new york there were also foilcovered chocolate santas with rouged cheeks and abundant white hair meant to resemble confections of a hundred years ago and mesh sacks of chocolate coins wrapped in silver and gold foil naomi picked up six sacks of coins and six santas she knew that several of the children on the ward had dietary restrictions forbidding them to eat chocolate but surely there would be some who would be allowed to have it and there were always the nurses her hands full she stood patiently in line waiting for her turn there was a man ahead of her wearing a greenishgray raincoat and a ridiculouslooking yellow rain hat the kind of thing fishermen wore and was now found in j crew and ll bean catalogs the hat seemed to be too large for him and resembled in some vague way a hen that had come to roost on his head when he ordered his coffee a double hazelnut latte with whipped cream and cinnamon she thought she could detect something familiar about his voice when he turned around she recognized him michael mcbride the head of the pediatric unit at holy name the man who last summer had told her that her sevenyearold daughter dahlia was dead mcbride stood there a cup of steaming fragrant liquid in his hand she saw at once that he knew who she was mrs wechsler it was not a question its been a while only five months two days and about ten hours she wanted to say but she didnt i hope everything has been all right with you and your husband were fine naomi said and moved past him she could sense him still standing there as she ordered but she didnt turn around again instead she paid for the coffee and the chocolate and accepted the bags with which to carry them all without looking at him a second time she went over to a high circular table to retrieve napkins a stirrer and a packet of sugar it wasnt strange to run into him of course he worked in the hospital and now she did too the only strange thing about the encounter was that it hadnt happened sooner back outside the wind was still blowing the sleet around in wet angry gusts naomi reached the hospitals wide automatic doors with relief as she stepped inside she opened the lid of the coffee took a sip and then another she saw mcbride yellow hat now collapsed under his arm talking to a doctor right next to the large lavishly decorated christmas tree in the hospitals lobby she stayed out of sight so that she wouldnt have to speak to him but even mcbrides presence painful as it was to her wouldnt stop her from coming here if she ran into him again and she knew she would she would find some way of being or acting that didnt rip her heart out she knew she would be able to do it hadnt she managed to live through the last five months if she could do that she could do anything although they had never discussed it naomi suspected that rick avoided the hospital entirely she could imagine him walking along seventh avenue toward that wellstocked secondhand bookshop that had opened on seventh street or toward two little hens the bakery he liked up on eighth avenue always making sure that he was on the other side of the street naomi herself wasnt entirely certain why she was drawn here she told herself it was better than spending her days on the couch her eyes tracking the progress of the light as it filtered into the front windows of the house in the morning and later in the day through the dining room windows in back but that was only part of it this was the year she had planned to return to graduate school for her phd in english literature dahlia was getting older naomi thought that she could comfortably leave her with rick when she took her classes or spent time in the library after dahlia had died though naomi lost interest in pursuing an advanced degree yet she didnt want to go back to teaching either for the last three years she had been employed at a small tony private school in brooklyn heights the neighborhood elegantly maintained homes of brick brownstone and limestone tall graceful windows with a glimpse of a chandelier through one a sheer patterned curtain at another was lovely she liked the other teachers and the headmaster the orderly routine of her days that included classes in the mornings prep periods in the afternoons and lunch with her husband when he could take a break between his appointments and dahlia had been enrolled there as well in the lower school so that naomis morning and afternoon commute dovetailed nicely with the dropping off and picking up of her daughter but the teaching itself had worn her down the room of jaded fifteenyearolds surreptitiously making calls or playing games on their cell phones the girls exchanging notes or examining their hair for split ends and what girls they were the leader of the pack cordelia cox was tall and thinfaced with a cascade of black hair a jeweled navel ring and an uncanny ability to cow both her friends and enemies once naomi had found her in the girls bathroom taunting meg stanton one of her less popular classmates with a handful of tampons cordelia had used lipstick to color their tips red when naomi had walked in cordelia was holding one of the besmeared tampons aloft by its short white string the other girls were visibly frightened when they saw naomi not cordelia the tampon was swaying a bit as if she had been shaking or flicking it with her finger whats going on here naomi had said looking back and forth from cordelias cool composed face to megs tense uncomfortable one are you conducting a hygiene class i was just explaining to meg about the differences in tampon sizes she pointed to her selection fanned out on the sink super regular light some of the other girls couldnt help snickering and the lipstick to make them seem more realistic arent you always telling us to use realistic details mrs wechsler to make our writing come alive well class is over naomi said in a clipped furious voice she abruptly knocked all the tampons off the sink clean this up now the other girls quickly knelt down and began gathering tampons theres lipstick on the floor and on the sink someone will have to clean that up too cordelia hadnt moved though meg had managed to inch away toward the door naomi looked over at her thats all right meg you can go when the room was tidied again naomi dismissed the other girls but asked cordelia to remain behind the audacity of that girl and the cowardice of the others throw that out naomi said indicating the tampon cordelia still held cordelia complied but nothing seemed to penetrate or to alter the controlled condescending look on her face was that fun naomi asked when the tampon was at last in the trash was what fun tormenting meg meg cordelia looked bored meg can take care of herself evidently so can you naomi sent cordelia back to class with the others had she stayed any longer naomi thought she might have actually slapped her instead she ran the cold water and splashed it on her wrists and face she was so angry she was shaking later she mentioned the incident to the headmaster who commiserated and called cordelia into his office there had been a detention and some community service that the girl had been asked to perform but somehow naomi didnt feel vindicated only disgusted she had had enough of these entitled girls this school this work she needed to immerse herself in something altogether different and after dahlia had died she found that something at holy name here was a place a world really where time was told by the intravenous drip that administered medication the distance from a room to an operating lab the buzz and whir of the xray machines as they recorded their mysterious internal data naomi did a little bit of everything she wheeled picture books around on rolling carts read curious george goes to the fire station six times to a boy waiting his turn for the dialysis machine held the basin into which a fourteenyearold girl vomited after her chemotherapy treatment good morning said pat ryan the volunteer coordinator as naomi came into the volunteer services office and hung her wet coat and umbrella on a hook on the back of a door hi pat did any new toys come in since wednesday now that the holiday season was here naomi had been put in charge of wrapping and labeling gifts for the children on the ward most of which had been donated by local schools and businesses theres a bag over there see it the big brown one with the handles naomi found the bag and peered inside on top were three beanie babies a whale a kitten and an elephant adorable but hard to wrap below she saw several boxes of crayola crayons some thick pads of paper a coloring book featuring the power puff girls do you have wrapping paper naomi nodded then you can work in here im at a meeting for most of the morning god help me pat walked by and eyed naomis coffee that smells good you didnt get it here did you no naomi smiled at pat who lingered for a moment in the doorway but when your meeting is over ill run over and get you a cup its so miserable outside the store is just across the street naomi shrugged off the minor inconvenience what do you take in it milk sugar the works pat smiled back thanks naomi youre an angel an angel naomi repeated the phrase in her mind rick wouldnt think so neither would her mother estelle whom she had not long ago placed in that riverdale nursing home how was it that she managed to disappoint each of them in such different yet equally damning ways but here at holy name she was effective competent in control everyone seemed to like her and to her own grateful amazement she liked everyone she had encountered here pat ryan the beleaguered parents overworked nurses the army of physicians the technicians and janitors and the children the children were what made the whole thing worth doing naomi went to a cupboard behind pats desk where she had stored the wrapping paper and ribbons she had purchased there were two packages of red tissue good she could use some of the sheets to wrap the beanies then she would find a way to secure the lumpy bundles with ribbon pulling the long tubes out of the bag she surveyed paper with snowmen with dreidels with candy canes paper that was nothing but a roll of shining metallic green pat kept a small radio in her office naomi turned it on to an oldies station and the strains of the beach boys that creamy california sound filled the office for over an hour naomi unfurled and snipped wrapped and labeled mets monopoly and scrabble junior a plasticboxed kit containing four bottles of nail polish a nail buffer polish remover and ten snowflake decals one for each fingernail as she looped a length of gold ribbon around the wrapped kit naomi found herself thinking that dahlia would have loved such a thing she could endure this thought only within the confines of holy name had she been at home or anywhere else such an observation would have caused her to convulse with sadness with weeping but here she was relatively safe she thought of the girl who might well receive this gift holly munsford a little younger than naomis former students holly was someone they nonetheless would have dubbed all that which meant that holly seemed to have everything a lithe athletic body a blond braid that dipped down to her waist a straighta average a boyfriend who was a high school senior oh and lymphatic cancer she had that too pat naomi looked up there stood michael mcbride again she had been working at holy name since the end of september and had not run into him until today when she happened to see him twice pats in a meeting she told me i could use her office i see mcbride stood in the doorway he was as disheveled as she remembered with the buttons on his white doctors coat fastened incorrectly and several creases in his tie youre volunteering here now since september naomi was still holding a pair of scissors in one hand the spool of gold ribbon in the other i hadnt realized why would you her voice sounded colder than she meant it to still why was he here taking up her time im sorry mcbrides face reddened slightly i just meant that if i had known if you had known then what naomi put down the scissors the ribbon this man should not be here talking to her stirring things up that she didnt want stirred i would have talked to you sooner his voice was firm authoritative she wasnt surprised he was the head of a department after all she couldnt have been the first mother of a dead child with whom he had spoken and what would you have said an angel pat had called her an angel but would an angel have used such a bitchy voice to someone who was in his fashion trying to be kind i would have told you how sorry i was am you said that already in july i would have said it again why it wont change anything because its true im always sorry when we lose a patient dahlia was never your patient it was a good thing she had put the scissors down she had a mad but electrifying impulse to hurl them across the room as if she were a turbaned and bejeweled knife thrower with deadly aim as soon as she came through the doors of this facility she was our patient said michael mcbride they all are every single one of them despite the wrinkled tie naomi saw there was a blurred dark smear on it too and the crooked buttons he seemed in that moment enormously dignified now im the one whos sorry her anger suddenly dissipated and left her drained and even a little weak coffee she wanted another cup of coffee and she had promised to get one for pat who would be back in the office any time now naomi stood and reached for her coat are you leaving michael mcbride fixed his dark blue eyes on her face just for another coffee then ill be back ill come with you but you dont have a coat it doesnt matter its not far he took her elbow and guided her through the corridor and toward the doors on sixth street as the doors slid open naomi saw that although the wind still whipped the wet leaves and bits of debris up the street the rain itself had stopped and the heavy gray clouds showed an improbable streak of sunlight between their large and threatening shapes it was only when they reached the barnes noble store and his hand left her elbow to open the door that she noticed she had not once recoiled from his touch
