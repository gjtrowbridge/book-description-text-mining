 the air still smelled of charcoal when i arrived in venice three days after the fire as it happened the timing of my visit was purely coincidental i had made plans months before to come to venice for a few weeks in the offseason in order to enjoy the city without the crush of other tourists if there had been a wind monday night the watertaxi driver told me as we came across the lagoon from the airport there wouldnt be a venice to come to how did it happen i asked the taxi driver shrugged how do all these things happen it was early february in the middle of the peaceful lull that settles over venice every year between new years day and carnival the tourists had gone and in their absence the venice they inhabited had all but closed down hotel lobbies and souvenir shops stood virtually empty gondolas lay tethered to poles and covered in blue tarpaulin unbought copies of the international herald tribune remained on newsstand racks all day and pigeons abandoned sparse pickings in st marks square to scavenge for crumbs in other parts of the city meanwhile the other venice the one inhabited by venetians was as busy as everthe neighborhood shops the vegetable stands the fish markets the wine bars for these few weeks venetians could stride through their city without having to squeeze past dense clusters of slowmoving tourists the city breathed its pulse quickened venetians had venice all to themselves but the atmosphere was subdued people spoke in hushed dazed tones of the sort one hears when there has been a sudden death in the family the subject was on everyones lips within days i had heard about it in such detail i felt as if i had been there myself it happened on monday evening january 29 1996 shortly before nine oclock archimede seguso sat down at the dinner table and unfolded his napkin before joining him his wife went into the living room to lower the curtains which was her longstanding evening ritual signora seguso knew very well that no one could see in through the windows but it was her way of enfolding her family in a domestic embrace the segusos lived on the third floor of ca capello a sixteenthcentury house in the heart of venice a narrow canal wrapped around two sides of the building before flowing into the grand canal a short distance away signor seguso waited patiently at the table he was eightysixtall thin his posture still erect a fringe of wispy white hair and flaring eyebrows gave him the look of a kindly sorcerer full of wonder and surprise he had an animated face and sparkling eyes that captivated everyone who met him if you happened to be in his presence for any length of time however your eye would eventually be drawn to his hands they were large muscular hands the hands of an artisan whose work demanded physical strength for seventyfive years signor seguso had stood in front of a blazinghot glassworks furnaceten twelve eighteen hours a dayholding a heavy steel pipe in his hands turning it to prevent the dollop of molten glass at the other end from drooping to one side or the other pausing to blow into it to inflate the glass then laying it across his workbench still turning it with his left hand while with a pair of tongs in his right hand pulling pinching and coaxing the glass into the shape of graceful vases bowls and goblets after all those years of turning the steel pipe hour after hour signor segusos left hand had molded itself around the pipe until it became permanently cupped as if the pipe were always in it his cupped hand was the proud mark of his craft and this was why the artist who painted his portrait some years ago had taken particular care to show the curve in his left hand men in the seguso family had been glassmakers since the fourteenth century archimede was the twentyfirst generation and one of the greatest of them all he could sculpt heavy pieces out of solid glass and blow vases so thin and fragile they could barely be touched he was the first glassmaker ever to see his work honored with an exhibition in the doges palace in st marks square tiffany sold his pieces in its fifth avenue store archimede seguso had been making glass since the age of eleven and by the time he was twenty he had earned the nickname mago del fuoco wizard of fire he no longer had the stamina to stand in front of a hot and howling furnace eighteen hours a day but he worked every day nonetheless and with undiminished pleasure on this particular day in fact he had risen at his usual hour of 430 am convinced as always that the pieces he was about to make would be more beautiful than any he had ever made before in the living room signora seguso paused to look out the window before lowering the curtain she noticed that the air had become hazy and she mused aloud that a winter fog had set in in response signor seguso remarked from the other room that it must have come in very quickly because he had seen the quarter moon in a clear sky only a few minutes before the living room window looked across a small canal at the back of the fenice opera house thirty feet away rising above it in the distance some one hundred yards away the theaters grand entrance wing appeared to be shrouded in mist just as she started to lower the curtain signora seguso saw a flash she thought it was lightning then she saw another flash and this time she knew it was fire papa she cried out the fenice is on fire signor seguso came quickly to the window more flames flickered at the front of the theater illuminating what signora seguso had thought was mist but had in fact been smoke she rushed to the telephone and dialed 115 for the fire brigade signor seguso went into his bedroom and stood at the corner window which was even closer to the fenice than the living room window between the fire and the segusos house lay a jumble of buildings that constituted the fenice the part on fire was farthest away the chaste neoclassical entrance wing with its formal reception rooms known collectively as the apollonian rooms then came the main body of the theater with its elaborately rococo auditorium and finally the vast backstage area flaring out from both sides of the auditorium and the backstage were clusters of smaller interconnected buildings like the one that housed the scenery workshop immediately across the narrow canal from signor seguso signora seguso could not get through to the fire brigade so she dialed 112 for the police the enormity of what was happening outside his window stunned signor seguso the gran teatro la fenice was one of the splendors of venice it was arguably the most beautiful opera house in the world and one of the most significant the fenice had commissioned dozens of operas that had premiered on its stageverdis la traviata and rigoletto igor stravinskys the rakes progress benjamin brittens the turn of the screw for two hundred years audiences had delighted in the sumptuous clarity of the fenices acoustics the magnificence of its five tiers of giltencrusted boxes and the baroque fantasy of it all signor and signora seguso had always taken a box for the season and over the years they had been given increasingly desirable locations until they finally found themselves next to the royal box signora seguso had no luck getting through to the police either and now she was becoming frantic she called upstairs to the apartment where her son gino lived with his wife and their son antonio gino was still out at the seguso glass factory in murano antonio was visiting a friend near the rialto signor seguso stood silently at his bedroom window watching as the flames raced across the entire top floor of the entrance wing he knew that for all its storied loveliness the fenice was at this moment an enormous pile of exquisite kindling inside a thick shell of istrian stone lined with brick the structure was made entirely of woodwooden beams wooden floors wooden wallsrichly embellished with wood carvings sculpted stucco and papiermch all of it covered with layer upon layer of lacquer and gilt signor seguso was aware too that the scenery workshop just across the canal from his house was stocked with solvents and most worrisome of all cylinders of propane gas that were used for welding and soldering signora seguso came back into the room to say she had finally spoken with the police they already knew about the fire she said they told me we should leave the house at once she looked over her husbands shoulder and stifled a scream the flames had moved closer in the short time she had been away from the window they were now advancing through the four smaller reception halls toward the main body of the theater in their direction archimede seguso stared into the fire with an appraising eye he opened the window and a gust of bittercold air rushed in the wind was blowing to the southwest the segusos were due west of the theater however and signor seguso calculated that if the wind did not change direction or pick up strength the fire would advance toward the other side of the fenice rather than in their direction now nandina he said softly stay calm were not in any danger the segusos house was only one of many buildings close to the fenice except for campo san fantin a small plaza at the front of the theater the fenice was hemmed in by old and equally flammable buildings many of them attached to it or separated from it by only four or five feet this was not at all unusual in venice where building space had always been at a premium seen from above venice resembled a jigsaw puzzle of terracotta rooftops passages between some of the buildings were so narrow one could not walk through them with an open umbrella it had become a specialty of venetian burglars to escape from the scene of a crime by leaping from roof to roof if the fire in the fenice were able to make the same sort of leap it would almost certainly destroy a sizable swath of venice the fenice itself was dark it had been closed five months for renovations and was due to reopen in a month the canal along its rear faade was also closedemptyhaving been sealed off and drained so work crews could dredge the silt and sludge from it and repair its walls for the first time in forty years the canal between the segusos building and the back of the fenice was now a deep muddy gulch with a tangle of exposed pipes and a few pieces of heavy machinery sitting in puddles at the bottom the empty canal would make it impossible for fireboats to reach the fenice and worse than that it would deprive them of a source of water venetian firemen depended on water pumped directly from the canals to put out fires the city had no system of fire hydrants the fenice was now ringed by a tumult of shouts and running footsteps tenants routed from their houses by the police crossed paths with patrons coming out of the ristorante antico martini a dozen bewildered guests rolled suitcases out of the hotel la fenice asking directions to the hotel saturnia where they had been told to go into their midst a wildeyed woman wearing only a nightgown came stumbling from her house into campo san fantin screaming hysterically she threw herself to the ground in front of the theater flailing her arms and rolling on the pavement several waiters came out of the antico martini and led her inside two fireboats managed to navigate to a waterfilled canal a short distance from the fenice their hoses were not long enough to reach around the intervening buildings however so the firemen dragged them through the kitchen window at the back of the antico martini and out through the dining room into campo san fantin they aimed their nozzles at flames burning furiously in a topfloor window of the theater but the water pressure was too low the arc of water barely reached the windowsill the fire went on leaping and taunting and sucking up great turbulent currents of air that set the flames snapping like brilliant red sails in a violent wind several policemen struggled with the massive front door of the fenice but to no avail one of them drew his pistol and fired three shots at the lock the door opened two firemen rushed in and disappeared into a dense white wall of smoke moments later they came running out its too late said one its burning like straw the wail of sirens now filled the air as police and firemen raced up and down the grand canal in motorboats spanking up huge butterfly wings of spray as they bounced through the wakes of other boats about an hour after the first alarm the citys big fire launch pulled up at the landing stage behind haigs bar its highpowered rigs would at last be able to pump water the two hundred yards from the grand canal to the fenice dozens of firemen ran hoses from the fire launch into campo santa maria del giglio feverishly coupling sections together but it was immediately apparent that the hoses were of different gauges leaks sprayed from the couplings but the firemen carried the linked hoses such as they were up to the rooftops around the fenice anyway they directed half the water onto the theater in an attempt to contain the fire and the rest of it onto adjacent buildings fire commandant alfio pini had already made a momentous strategic decision the fenice was lost save the city when the lights went out count girolamo marcello was midsentence in a conversation over dinner with his son on the top floor of his palace less than a minutes walk from the front of the fenice earlier in the day count marcello had learned that the exiled russian poet and nobel laureate joseph brodsky had died suddenly of a heart attack at fiftyfive in new york brodsky had been a passionate lover of venice and a friend and houseguest of marcellos it was while he was staying in marcellos palace in fact that brodsky had written his last book watermark a lyrical reflection on venice that afternoon marcello had spoken by phone with brodskys widow maria and they had discussed the possibility of burying brodsky in venice marcello knew that this would not be easily arranged every available plot on the burial island of san michele had been spoken for years ago it was generally understood that any new arrival even a native venetian would be dug up in ten years and moved to a common burial site farther out in the lagoon but for a nonvenetian jewish atheist gaining approval for even a temporary burial would be a quest fraught with obstacles still there had been notable exceptions igor stravinsky had been buried on san michele and so had sergei diaghilev and ezra pound they had all been buried in the anglican and greek orthodox section and all would be allowed to remain there in perpetuity so there was reason to hope that brodsky could be buried there too and this was on marcellos mind when the lights went out father and son sat in darkness for a while expecting the lights to come back on then they heard the sirens lots of them many more than usual lets go up and see whats happened said marcello they headed upstairs to the wooden deck on the roof the altana and as soon as they opened the door they saw the raging fire marcello decided they should leave the house at once they descended the stairs feeling their way in the darkness marcello wondering if the sixhundredyearold palace was doomed if it was the most impressive private library in venice would disappear with it marcellos library occupied most of the second floor it was an architectural delight a highceilinged space complete with a wraparound wooden gallery that could be reached only by climbing a secret stairway hidden behind a panel in the wall the floortoceiling shelves held forty thousand volumes of private and state papers some of them more than a thousand years old the collection amounted to a treasure trove of venetian history and marcello regularly made it available to scholars he himself spent long hours sitting in a thronelike black leather armchair perusing the archives especially the papers of the marcello family which was one of the oldest in venice marcellos ancestors included a fifteenthcentury doge or head of state the marcellos had in fact been among the families that built the fenice and owned it until just before world war ii when the municipality of venice took it over
