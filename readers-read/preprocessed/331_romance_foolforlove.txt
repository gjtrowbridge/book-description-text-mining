 chapter one in which simon darby receives undesirable news 28 park lane london some men turn into walruses when theyre angry all bushy and blowing air others resemble pigs with pillowy cheeks and small eyes simon darby turned into a cossack his eyes took on a slanted look high cheekbones that spoke of generations of darbys turned formidable angular and altogether foreign to gerard bunges mind the man looked positively savage the last time the honorable gerard bunge himself could remember being so enraged was when his doctor informed him that he had caught the pox even remembering the moment made him queasy there was that uneasy sense of heavenly retribution not to mention the unpleasant treatment lying ahead but even less would he like to be told that his inheritance had disappeared after all diseases come and go but life is so expensive even handkerchiefs are prohibitive darby was probably in shock so bunge repeated himself theres no question about it your aunt is increasing when darby still didnt answer bunge strolled over to the litter of china dogs lining the mantelpiece and thought about poverty versus the pox again definitely syphilis was preferable i said lady rawlings is enceinte i mean to say the countess of trent paid her a visit in the country and described the lady as waddling did you hear me darby they likely heard you in norfolk silence bunge couldnt stand silence himself but it wasnt every day that a man had his inheritance snatched out from under his nose by an unborn babe tossing back his deep cuffs he pushed the china dogs into a neat row there had to be fourteen or fifteen of the lolling garishly painted little things i suppose these belong to one of your sisters he said over his shoulder the thought of darbys sisters made bunge feel a bit uncomfortable after all if esme rawlingss child was male they had just lost their dowries actually the dogs belonged to my stepmother darby remarked quite the mortality rate in darbys family bunge reflected father stepmother uncle gone in under one year i wish your aunt werent increasing damned if i dont he said displaying a rare flash of generosity he swallowed a curse as the sharp edge of his starched linen collar nipped him in the neck he had to remember not to turn his head so quickly the new high collars were the devil to wear it could hardly be construed as your fault i gather my uncle and aunt had an unexpected rapprochement before his death startled me to the gills when i heard he died in his wifes chamber bunge agreed not that lady rawlings isnt a beautiful woman but your uncle hadnt lived with his wife for years he was snug in lady childes pocket when i saw him last i thought rawlings and his wife werent even on speaking terms as far as i know they rarely spoke presumably they engaged in heirmaking without speech some are saying the child isnt rawlingss you know given that my uncle died in his wifes bedchamber he and his wife likely engaged in activities that led to this child you will please me by squashing any such rumors darbys eyes now wore their customary expression of detached amusement youre going to have to get married bunge pointed out course that wont be too difficult for you catching a rich one heard that theres a wool merchant putting his daughter on the market this season everyones saying shes a woolly breeder he erupted in a cascade of highpitched laughter but darbys eyes hardened into distaste an unappetizing possibility he gave a little half bow much though i adore your company bunge i have an appointment this afternoon cool bastard bunge thought to himself but he let himself be propelled toward the door are you going to tell your stepsisters naturally their esteemed aunt is going to have a baby josephine will be delighted does she know that the babe will do her out of a fortune i fail to see why inheritance issues should disturb a child still in the nursery and you never know lady rawlings might have a girl a pleasing thought under the circumstances youre a cool one dont know what id do if i had two girls to get off on the market and you would do admirably darby rang the bell and his butler fanning appeared with bunges coat hat and cane as he walked back into his study the mask of detached amusement fell from darbys face he had choked back his rage in front of the painted popinjay who had so delighted in telling him of his aunts pregnancy but anger swelled in his throat goddamned bitch the words burned like poison in his mouth whatever his uncle was doing in his wifes bedchamber it didnt involve fornication rawlings had told him last july just before he died that the doctor had ruled out connubial acts and since hed been a little in his cups hed added that lady childe was agreeable no need to mention his wife and he hadnt his mistress lady childe was the only person remotely interested in miless ability to shake the bedsheets and yet he died in esme rawlingss bedchamber a week or so later suffered a heart attack in his wifes bedchamber and now the woman was increasing waddling even doubtless the child would be born on the early side the house party took place last july if the child were miless his wife was six months along at the most and why would the elegantly slim lady rawlings be waddling at only six months with three long months to go
