 what i saw made me catch my breath i instantly knew that i wouldnt have any trouble finding the gate again thats because looming up in front of me was the hugest tree i had ever seen im not talking big i mean immense colossal impossible the trunk at the base must have been thirty yards across did you ever see a picture of those trees in california that have a tunnel cut through the base you could drive a car through well if there were a tunnel cut into the base of this tree you could drive four eighteen wheelers through side by side and still have room for a couple of hummers it was like a skyscraper covered with bark looking up the branches didnt even begin for about fifty yards up then the tree spread out into a canopy that could shade yankee stadium i dont know why but being next to giant things like that makes my palms sweat and they were definitely sweating thats how awesome it was i looked to the base of the tree and saw the small opening that i had crawled out of it was so small compared to this monster tree that if i didnt know it was there id have missed it sure enough carved in the bark just above the opening was the star symbol that marked it as a gate to the flume unbelievable now the hanging vines in the cavern below made sense they were the root system of this immense tree i walked along the base running my hand across the rough bark you could live in this treewith all of your friends and their families and still have room for a keebler cookie factory i took a step back looked up and laughed the impossible kept proving itself to be possible what was i going to see next the answer came quickly and it wasnt a good one i felt something hit the back of my leg i looked down and instantly wished i hadnt because lying on the ground next to my leg was an arm a bloody human arm i quickly looked up to the direction it came from and felt like the wind was knocked out of me if the big tree hadnt been there to catch me i would have fallen back on my butt standing ten yards away from me was a beast it was like nothing i had ever seen before the first thing i thought of wasdinosaur it stood upright on two legs with a long thick tail that whipped back and forth angrily it looked to be around seven feet tall with powerful arms and hands that were threefinger talons same with its feet its entire body was bright green like a lizard with scales covering it but what i couldnt take my eyes off of was its head it was reptilian with a snoutlike nose it had bright green hair that swept back from its forehead and fell halfway down its back but most hideous was its mouth it looked like a sharkmouth with multiple rows of sharp teeth that were all about tearing flesh and thats exactly what it was doing because clasped in its jaws was another human arm blood ran into the beasts mouth and down its chin if i werent so scared i would have gotten sick we held eye contact i could feel this monster sizing me up its eyes were red and angry without looking away it closed its jaws crunching the arm like a dry twig the sound made my stomach turn the monster flipped out a green tongue and sucked the shattered arm into its mouth one gulp later the arm was gone swallowed bone and all gross it turned back to me as its mouth twisted into a bloody grin i was next on the menu welcome to eelong
