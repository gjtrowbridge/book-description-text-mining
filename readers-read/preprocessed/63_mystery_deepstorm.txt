 it looked peter crane thought like a stork a huge white stork rising out of the water on ridiculously delicate legs but as the helicopter drew closer and the distant outline sharpened against the sea horizon the resemblance gradually fell away the legs grew sturdier became tubular pylons of steel and pre8211stressed concrete the central body became a multi8211level superstructure studded with flare stacks and turbines festooned with spars and girders and the thin neck8211like object above resolved into a complex craneandderrick assembly rising several hundred feet above the superstructure the pilot pointed at the approaching platform held up two fingers crane nodded his understanding it was a brilliant cloudless day and crane squinted against the bright ocean stretching away on all sides he felt tired and disoriented by travel commercial flight from miami to new york private gulfstream g150 charter to reykjavik and now helicopter but the weariness hadn8217t blunted his deep8212and growing8212curiosity it wasn8217t so much that amalgamated shale was interested in his particular expertise that he thought he could understand it was the hurry with which they8217d wanted him to drop everything and rush out to the storm king platform that surprised him then there was the fact that amshale8217s forward headquarters in iceland had rather oddly been bustling with technicians and engineers rather than the usual drillers and roughnecks and then there was the other thing the helicopter pilot wasn8217t an amshale employee he wore a navy uniform8212and a sidearm as the chopper banked sharply around the side of the platform heading for the landing zone crane realized for the first time just how large the oil rig was the jacket structure alone had to be eight stories high its upper deck was covered with a bewildering maze of modular structures here and there men in yellow safety uniforms checked couplings and worked pump equipment dwarfed by the machinery that surrounded them far far below the ocean frothed and worried around the pillars of the substructure where it vanished beneath the surface to run the thousands of feet to the sea floor itself the chopper slowed turned and settled down onto the green hexagon of the landing zone as crane reached back for his bags he noticed that someone was standing at the edge of the lz waiting a tall thin woman in an oilskin jacket he thanked the pilot opened the passenger door and stepped out into frigid air ducking instinctively under the whirring blades the woman held out her hand at his approach 8220dr crane8221 crane shook the hand 8220yes8221 8220this way please8221 the woman turned and led the way off the landing platform down a short set of stairs and along a metal catwalk to a closed submarine8211style hatch she did not give her name a uniformed seaman stood guard outside the hatch rifle at his side he nodded as they approached opened the hatch then closed and secured it behind them beyond lay a spacious brightly8211lit corridor studded along both sides with open doors there was no frantic hum of turbines no deep throbbing of derrick equipment the smell of oil though detectable was faint almost as if efforts had been made to remove it crane followed the woman bags slung over his shoulder glancing curiously into the rooms as he passed once again curiosity pricked at him there were laboratories full of whiteboards and workstations computer centers communications suites topside had been quiet but there was plenty of activity here crane decided he8217d venture a question 8220are the divers in a hyperbaric chamber8221 he asked 8220can i see them now8221 8220this way please8221 the woman repeated they turned a corner descended a staircase and entered another hallway even wider and longer than the first the rooms they passed were larger here machine shops storage bays for high8211tech equipment crane didn8217t recognize crane frowned although storm king resembled an oil rig in all outward appearances it was clearly no longer in the business of pumping crude what the hell is going on here 8220have any vascular specialists or pulmonologists been flown in from iceland8221 he asked the woman didn8217t answer and crane shrugged he8217d come this far8212he could stand to wait another couple of minutes up ahead the woman had stopped before a closed door of gray metal 8220mr lassiter is waiting for you8221 she said lassiter crane wondered that wasn8217t a name he recognized the person who8217d spoken to him over the phone briefed him about the problem at the rig had been named simon he glanced at the door there was the nameplate white letters on black plastic spelling out e lassiter external liaison crane turned back to the woman in the oilskin jacket but she was already moving down the corridor he shifted his bags knocked on the door 8220enter8221 came the crisp voice from within e lassiter was a tall thin man with closely8211cropped blond hair he stood up as crane entered came around his desk shook hands he wasn8217t wearing a military uniform but with his haircut and his brisk economical movements he might as well have been the office was small and just as efficient8211looking as its tenant the desk was almost studiously bare there was a single manila envelope on it carefully sealed and a digital recorder 8220you can stow your gear there8221 lassiter said indicating a far corner 8220please sit down8221 8220thanks8221 crane took the proffered seat 8220i8217m eager to learn just what the emergency is my escort here didnt have much to say on the subject8221 8220actually neither will i8221 lassiter gave a brief smile which disappeared as quickly as it came 8220that will come my job is to ask you a few questions8221 crane digested this 8220go ahead8221 he said after a moment lassiter pressed a button on the recorder 8220this recording is taking place on june 2 present are myself8212edward lassiter8212and dr peter crane location is the e r f support and supply station8221 lassiter glanced over the desk at crane 8220dr crane you are aware that your tour of service here cannot be fixed to a specific length8221 8220yes8221 8220and you understand that you must never divulge anything you witness here or recount your actions while at the facility8221 8220yes8221 8220and are you willing to sign an affidavit to that effect8221 8220yes8221 8220dr crane have you ever been arrested8221 8220no8221 8220were you born a citizen of the united states or are you naturalized8221 8220i was born in new york city8221 8220are you taking medication for any ongoing physical condition8221 8220no8221 8220do you abuse alcohol or drugs with any regularity8221 crane had fielded the questions with growing surprise 8220unless you call the occasional weekend six8211pack 8216abuse8217 then no8221 lassiter didn8217t smile 8220are you claustrophobic dr crane8221 8220no8221 lassiter put the recorder on pause then he picked up the manila envelope slit it open with a finger pulled out half a dozen sheets of paper and passed them across the table 8220if you could please read and sign each of these8221 he said plucking a pen from a pocket and placing it beside the sheets crane picked them up and began to read as he did so his surprise turned to something close to disbelief there were three separate non8211disclosure agreements an official secrets act affidavit and something called a binding cooperation initiative all were branded documents of the us government all required signature and all threatened dire consequences if any of their articles were breached crane put the documents down he was uncomfortably aware of lassiter8217s gaze upon him this was too much maybe he should thank lassiter politely then excuse himself and head back to florida but how exactly was he going to do that amshale had already paid a great deal of money to get him here the helicopter had already left he was8212to put it euphemistically8212between research projects at the moment and besides he had never been one to turn down a challenge especially one as mysterious as this he picked up the pen and without giving himself time to reconsider signed all six documents 8220thank you8221 lassiter said he started the recorder again 8220let the transcript show that dr crane has signed the requisite forms8221 then snapping off the recorder he stood 8220if youll follow me doctor i think youll get your answers8221 he led the way out of the office and down the corridor through a labyrinthine administrative area up an elevator and into a well8211furnished library stocked with books magazines and computer workstations lassiter gestured toward a table on the far side of the room which held only a computer monitor 8220i8217ll come back for you8221 he said then turned on his heel and left the room crane sat where directed watching the door close behind lassiter there was nobody else in the library and he was beginning to wonder what would happen next when the computer screen winked on in front of him it showed the face of a grey8211haired deeply tanned man in his late sixties some kind of introductory video crane thought but when the face smiled directly at him he realized he wasnt looking at a computer monitor but a closed8211circuit television screen with a tiny camera embedded in its upper frame 8220hello dr crane8221 the man said he smiled his kindly face breaking into a host of creases 8220my name is howard asher8221 8220pleased to meet you8221 crane told the screen 8220i8217m the chief scientist of the national ocean service have you heard of it8221 8220isn8217t that the ocean8211management arm of noaa8221 8220that8217s correct8221 8220i8217m a little confused dr asher8212it8217s doctor right8221 8220right but call me howard8221 8220howard what does the national ocean service have to do with an oil rig and where8217s mr simon the person who i spoke with on the phone the one who arranged all this he said he8217d be here to meet me8221 8220actually dr crane there is no mr simon but i8217m here and i8217ll be happy to explain what i can8221 crane frowned 8220i was told there were medical issues with the divers maintaining the rig8217s underwater equipment was that a deception too8221 8220only in part there has been a lot of deception and for that i8217m sorry but it was necessary we had to be sure you see secrecy is absolutely critical to this project because what we have here peter8212may i call you peter8212is the scientific and historical discovery of the century8221 8220the century8221 crane repeated not fully able to keep the disbelief from his voice 8220you8217re right to be doubtful but this is no deception peter it8217s the last thing from it still 8216discovery of the century8217 may not be quite accurate8221 8220i didn8217t think so8221 crane replied 8220i should have called it the greatest discovery of all time 8221 2 crane stared at the image on the viewscreen dr asher was smiling back at him in a friendly almost paternal way but there was nothing in the smile that suggested a joke 8220i couldn8217t tell you the truth peter until you were physically here at the facility and until you8217d been fully vetted we used your travel time to complete that process fact is there8217s still much i can8217t tell you even now8221 crane looked over his shoulder the library was empty 8220why isn8217t this line secure8221 8220oh it8217s secure but we need to know you8217re fully committed to the project first8221 crane waited saying nothing 8220what little i can tell you now is nevertheless highly secret even if you decline our offer you will still be bound by all the confidentiality agreements8221 8220i understand8221 crane said 8220very well8221 asher hesitated 8220peter the platform you8217re on right now is suspended over something more than an oil field something much more8221 8220what8217s thatquot crane asked automatically asher smiled mysteriously 8220suffice to say the well drillers on the platform discovered something nearly two years ago something so fantastic that overnight the platform stopped pumping oil and took on a new and highly secret role8221 8220let me guess you can8217t tell me what it is8221 asher laughed 8220no not yet but it8217s such an important discovery the government is quite literally sparing no expense to reclaim it8221 8220reclaim8221 8220it8217s buried in the sea bed directly below this platform remember i called this the discovery of all time what8217s going on here is in essence a dig an archaeological dig like none other and we are quite literally making history8221 8220but why all the secrecy8221 8220because if people caught wind of what we8217ve found it would instantly become front8211page news on every paper in the world in hours the place would be a disaster area half a dozen governments all claiming sovereignty journalists rubberneckers the discovery is simply too critical to be jeopardized that way8221 crane leaned back in his chair considering the entire trip was becoming almost surreal the rushed flight plans the oil platform that wasn8217t a platform the veil of secrecy8230and now this face in a box speaking of an unimaginably important discovery 8220call me old fashioned8221 he said 8220but i8217d feel a lot better about it if you8217d take the time to see me in person talk face to face8221 8220unfortunately peter it8217s not that easy commit to the project though and you8217ll see me soon enough8221 8220i don8217t understand why exactly is it so difficult8221 asher chuckled again 8220because at the moment i8217m several thousand feet beneath you8221 crane stared at the screen 8220you mean82128221 8220precisely the storm king oil platform is just the support structure the resupply station the real action is far below that8217s why i8217m speaking to you over this videofeed8221 crane digested this a moment 8220what8217s down there8221 he asked quietly 8220imagine a huge research station ten levels high full of equipment and technology beyond the cutting edge all sunk into the ocean floor that8217s the erf8212the heart and soul of the most extraordinary archaeological effort of all time8221 8220the erf8221 8220exploratory and recovery facility but we refer to it simply as the facility the military8212you know how fond they are of buzzwords8212have labeled it deep storm8221 8220i noticed the military presence why are the soldiers necessary8221 8220i could tell you it8217s because the facility is government property because the nos is a branch of the government and that8217s true but the real reason is because a lot of the technology we8217re using in the recovery project is classified8221 8220what about those men i saw topside working on the rig8221 8220window dressing for the most part we do have to look like a functioning oil platform after all8221 8220and amshale8221 8220they8217ve been paid exceptionally well to lease us the rig act as front office and ask no questions8221 crane shifted in his chair 8220this facility you mention that8217s where i8217d be quartered8221 8220yes it8217s where all the marine scientists historians and engineers live and work i know how much time you8217ve spent in submerged environments peter and i think you8217ll be pleasantly surprised actually 8216amazed8217 is more like it you8217ve got to see the place to believe it8212the facility is a miracle of undersea technology8221
