 chapter excerpt introduction healthy holidays it sounds like an oxymoron right its right up there with jumbo shrimp slumber party and working vacation its kind of like saying disciplined indulgence i was telling a friend of mine recently that i was writing a book called healthy holidays and he said healthy holidays is that even possible well im here to tell you that not only is it possible its guaranteed if you follow just a few simple rules after reading this book and enjoying a few healthy holidays of your own im sure you will agree that making your holidays healthy is the best way to enjoy them to their fullest i used to see every holiday as an opportunity to completely fall apart and i actually looked forward to falling apart i would even factor in recovery time naturally building it into my year i would plan for those days of indulgence and accept the consequences extra weight puffy face watery eyes stuffy nose headache constipation and bloating as though they were supposed to be a natural part of the celebration not to mention a pimple or two within the following week to most of us the essence of a holiday is indulgence and it should be but overindulgence is often the factor that ruins a holiday or party the suffering usually outweighs the pleasure not to mention how dangerous it is for our health the essence of a holiday is friends and family sharing and celebrating with a meat that usually involves some kind of guilty pleasure a little naughty and perhaps a little unhealthy but one that we look forward to because it isnt a part of our everyday routine in fact celebrating the holidays is a way of balancing our routine we work fortyplus hours a week and a holiday is a way of letting off steam and taking a break from that work we have been working hard and have been mentally building toward a reward holidays are usually celebrated on a weekend now that most of them have been moved to a convenient monday and the main objective is to gather with friends and family eat a little more play a little more and drink a little more in short live a little more sometimes a lot more now i dont want you to think that this is a book about avoiding those things we love during the holidays its not about being overly disciplined on holidays or at parties you wont be eating only raw food at your next thanksgiving dinner this book is about building a few simple corrective actions right into your holiday routine so that you wont gain weight or be sick hung over or forced to diet and detox for days or weeks after the holiday youre going to build a few of the elements of detox and diet right into your day and barely notice it this is analogous to sound financial planning if your overall goal is to be financially stable its best to budget and have a balanced and secure financial plan if you overspend during the holidays and blow money carelessly on every vacation youre likely to go into debt unless of course you are extremely wealthy but you can never reach a point with your health that would be equivalent to a billionaire with his money you can never be so healthy that it would be possible to eat and drink large quantities of junk and still be healthy and look great and even though the most affluent people can afford reckless spending i find it interesting that they usually tend to budget the most it is one of the main reasons the wealthy stay wealthy and that is the mentality i would like you to adopt regarding your health i want you to stay healthy and still thoroughly enjoy the holidays in fact youll probably enjoy them more and you wont need to recover for three days afterward people are always going to overdo it its human nature to want to contrast working hard with overindulging but if you can embrace little ways to keep yourself from falling off the deep end you will also teach your children some healthy habits in the process balanced eating during the holidays is a great message to send our kids we teach them by showing a good example which plants the seed in their heads that extreme eating habits are not a good idea this is more important than ever today when there is so much junk food in our childrens environment compared to when we were growing up and so many more opportunities for them to pick up bad habits when i was growing up i would eagerly wait for the holiday season starting with halloween i knew i was going to be sick the day after eating all that junk but there was no way i was going to skip even one candy corn and after thanksgiving dinner i knew i was going to be full and bloated and sick its not just an american tradition to be miserable after every holiday its the law and we dont feet satisfied until we are completely stuffed it is our goal to actually become the turkey i remember returning to school every january after christmas vacation even when i was as young as fourth grade realizing oh my gosh my uniform doesnt fit anymore as a teenager i would always begin a serious diet every january i know im not the only one who approached january this way in fact most people still do the average person gains seven or eight pounds between thanksgiving and new years day and everyone at one time or another attempts to change his or her life beginning in january right after the big holiday sweep these attempts are called new years resolutions if youre familiar with my books marilu henners total health makeover the 30day total health makeover and healthy life kitchen you know that one of the most important elements ive strived for in developing the total health makeover or thm lifestyle over the past twentythree years has been to find a way of eating that i could live with every day so of course much of this lifestyle had to be flexible and forgiving especially during the holidays i have always been somewhat of a party girl so it was important for me to find a way of getting through the holidays while still indulging and enjoying myself to this day i associate holidays with being a little naughty and eating and partying too much but now i dont fall apart and i enjoy the holidays now more than ever people always make fun of me for eating what they consider to be a strict diet they cant believe i have the discipline to never eat meat sugar or dairy products when i dine with friends for the first time they will often apologize for ordering something that i would not eat myself what they dont realize is that flavorwise and satisfactionwise my diet is identical to theirs its just healthier my taste buds now prefer healthier better food i threw a holiday party once for three hundred people i carefully went over the thm guidelines with the caterer no meat no sugar no dairy it was an endless feast with many hors doeuvres entres desserts everything devilish you can imagine because the food was so incredible people said wow you really broke the rules tonight didnt you they couldnt believe it when i told them that all the food fit within the thm guidelines and that not one item was served that i would not eat myself thm is simply a way to eat enjoy indulge and not feel sick the next day have you ever gotten into really great shape just to fall apart we get in shape to go on vacation be someones valentine see our relatives at christmas fit into that slinky halloween costume or tight little black dress we bust our butts and do whatever we must to get in perfect shape and then blow it all in one night by going for everything weve been missing its all about the entrance you want to look great for that moment when he she or they whoever youve been dieting for see you for the first time once that moment has passed you relax and dont stop eating and drinking until the party or holiday is over you may be thinking oh big deal so i gain one or two or ten pounds over the holidays that will only set me back a few days well i think a few days five to ten times a year is a big deal and it can be a serious setback for your health your appearance and your career even one overindulgent meal does measurable damage to our bodies especially our arteries this conclusion was reached after an extensive study conducted in australia recently after consuming just one meal high in animal fat around fifty grams the elasticity of a persons arterial walls and impeding blood flow drops by 27 percent and this lasts for several hours it was a pattern for me every christmas when i first moved to new york and later los angeles to get in great physical shape before i would go home to chicago it was important to me to show that i was doing well on my own in a new city and i knew i would see old boyfriends old friends and my three sisters and two grownup nieces you know how female relatives can be i would arrive and people would see me and say wow youve lost weight howd you do it this time after that initial presentation was over it became my personal responsibility to eat my way through chicago and for those of you not familiar with that incredible city chicago is made for eating the bottom line was i got in great shape so i would look good pigging out i was not the only one in my family who got in shape for christmas it was funny to observe how everyone worked their tight hot clothes the first few days but then the baggier stuff would quickly creep into everybodys wardrobe by new years day everyone would be wearing big tshirts pajamas robes and sweatpants i always had thin legs no matter how much i overindulged so i could always wear short skirts or leggings but my tops would get bigger and puffier as my waistline grew more undefined i would return to los angeles in january about twelve pounds heavier but it was not a big deal to me at the time a recovery period after every holiday was normal i would always make sure that i had at least one week off from business and major social obligations because i knew that when i got home id be overweight and constipated and my skin would be broken out for a week or two i would screen my calls or tell my agent that i had pinkeye or something else until i reached a respectable weight when it comes to work its a shame we cant call in fat we should get seven or eight fat days built into our work schedule per year and a whole fat week following christmas after many years of research and experimentation this mentality ended for me and now it can end for you on this program you will learn what to eat earlier in the day and what to eat the day after so that your holiday meal will go right through you there are foods and activities that will keep your body and digestion system functioning most efficiently and that is the key its all about taking out the trash a little naughty food and drink is not so bad if you rid your body of it quickly and most important naturally as i said it is building little pockets of discipline into your holiday experience and that little effort does the trick always keep in mind that health is a total picture the essence of this book is about celebrating holidays in a healthier way and that goes much deeper than simply planning what to eat food is only one of the elements to consider in planning your holiday there are many other exciting elements holiday history holiday memories invitations decorations toasts scents games and activities calorieburning exercises music movies party favors and just about anything else that can spice up a holiday the idea is to enjoy the holidays the way you did as a child and take some of the attention away from the food trust me it gets far too much attention as it is its like george clooney at a womens yoga class i keep waiting for him to show up at mine the point is you never know when someone like george clooney is going to pop into your day youve always got to be prepared and look your best and you cant consistently allow the holidays to set you back and force you into hiding lets start a year of healthy holidays together from new years day to new years eve im sure theyll be the best holidays ever christmas rosemary roast chicken serves 4 ingredients 1 33 12 pound organic freerange chicken rinsed giblets
