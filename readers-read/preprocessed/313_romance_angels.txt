id always lived a fairly blameless life up until the day i left my husband and then ran away to hollywood id hardly ever put a foot wrong not one that many people knew about anyway so when out of the blue everything just disintegrated like wet paper i couldnt shake a wormy suspicion that this was long overdue all that clean living simply isnt natural of course i didnt just wake up one morning and skip the country leaving my poor sleepy fool of a husband wondering what that envelope on his pillow was im making it sound much more dramatic than it actually was which is strange because i never used to have a penchant for dramatics or a penchant for words like penchant for that matter but ever since the business with the rabbits and possibly even before that things with garv had been uncomfortable and weird then wed suffered a couple of what wed chosen to call setbacks but instead of making our marriage stronger as always seemed to happen to the other luckier setback souls who popped up in my mothers womens magazines our particular brand of setbacks performed exactly as advertised they set us back they wedged themselves between myself and garv and alienated us from each other though he never said anything i knew garv blamed me and that was okay because i blamed me too his name is actually paul garvan but when i first got to know him we were both teenagers and nobody called anybody by their proper names micko and macker and toolser and you big shithead were some of the things our peers were known as he was garv its all ive ever known him as and i only call him paul when im extremely pissed off at him likewise my name is margaret but he calls me maggie except when i borrow his car and scrape the side against the pillar in the multistory parking garage something that occurs more regularly than you might think i was twentyfour and he was twentyfive when we got married hed been my first boyfriend as my poor mother never tires of telling people she reckons it demonstrates what a nice girl i was who never did any of that nasty sleepingaround business the only one of her five daughters who didnt who could blame her for parading my suspected virtue but what she conveniently omits to mention when shes making her proud boast is that garv might have been my first boyfriend but he wasnt my only one however wed been married for nine years and it would be hard to say exactly when id started to fantasize about it ending not let me tell you because i wanted it to be over but because i thought that if i imagined the worst possible scenario it would somehow be insurance against its actually happening however instead of insuring against it it conjured the whole bloody thing into existence which just goes to show the end came with surprising suddenness one minute my marriage was a going concern even if i was doing strange stuff like drinking my contact lenses the next minute it was entirely finito which caught me badly off guard as id always thought there was a regulation period of crockerythrowing and namecalling before the white flag could be waved but everything caved in without a single cross word being exchanged and i simply wasnt prepared for it god knows i should have been a few nights previously id woken in the darkness for a good worry something i often did usually fretting about work and money you know the usual having too much of one and not enough of the other but recently probably longer than recently actually id been worrying about me and garv instead would things ever get better were they better already and i just wasnt seeing it most nights i didnt come to any conclusions and lapsed back into an unreassured sleep but this time i was afflicted with sudden unwelcome xray vision i could see straight through the padding of the daily routine the private language and the shared past right into the heart of me and gary into all that had happened over the last while everything was stripped away and i had a horrible tooclear thought were in big trouble here it literally made me cold all the little hairs on my skin lifted and a chill settled somewhere between my ribs terrified i tried to cheer myself up by having a little fret about the amount of work id have to do the following day but no dice so then i reminded myself that my parents were getting older and that id be the one whod have to take care of them and tried to scare myself with that instead after a while i went back to sleep scratched my right arm raw ground my teeth with gusto awoke to the familiar sensation of a mouth coated with bits of grit and carried on as usual i was to remember that were in big trouble here when it transpired that we actually were on the evening in question we were supposed to be going out for dinner with elaine and liam friends of garvs and who knows if liams new flatscreen television hadnt fallen off the wall and onto his foot breaking his big toe in the process so that id gone out instead of going home maybe garv and i would never have split up the irony is i was praying that elaine and liam would cancel the chances were good the last three times we were supposed to meet it hadnt happened the first time
