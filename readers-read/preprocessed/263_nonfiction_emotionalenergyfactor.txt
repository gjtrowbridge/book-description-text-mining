my lifequot you dont need a reason for wanting more energyyou just know you need more but many of us can point to special reasons why we need more sometimes our energy is under attack because were going through a major life transition change is exhausting and its not just negative changes such as going through a divorce or dealing with a loved ones illness that deplete our energy positive changes toogetting married starting a new job or having a babytake a lot out of us sometimes our energy gets depleted because of a medical condition any illness from a bad cold on up can make a person

difference between people who get what they want out of life and people who dont is energy you could be the smartest most attractive most talented person in the world but without energy youd go nowhere like a meatball thats fallen on the floor with energy everything is possible its energy that gives life its sweetness and tang its energy that makes you feel like you its energy that makes your dreams come true sohows your energy if youre like most of us you want and need more well youve come to the right place this book will show you why youve been losing energy and what to do to get all the energy you want where to find your missing energy i know youve already tried to get more energy from many sources but ill bet theyve mostly been sources of physical energy like powerbars and coffee exercise and vitamins and these havent been enough gail 29 quotwheres my get up and go i was on the soccer team in high school and college track too i always take care of myself i eat right i live right eight hours sleep and id wake up fully refreshed ready to go out and have fun now im still doing all the same things the doctor said im fine physically so why am i tired all the time but its not my body thats tired its like its me thats tired inside my bodyquot millions of us feel the way gail feels the problem is that if youre like most americans youre close to being maxed out on the amount of additional energy you can get from physical sources physical energy sources are anything you go to for your bodys energy needs everything from food and rest to a carefully thought out exercise program and a full complement of vitamins and sure maybe you could get more sleep or eat a little more healthfully but the truth is that people living in the developed world today are healthier and more vital than ever before if youre feeling you need more energy the problem is most likely not with your body no wonder so many of us are caught in an energy rat race the more we need energy the more we try to boost our physical energy but we dont get the pop were looking for because theres not much more to get from physical sources we search for still newer sources of physical energy anyway and they dont help much either now you see why its been so hard to find more energy youre looking in the wrong place emotional energy is the answer youre not just a body are you so its not just your body that needs more energy its you a whole person you know that the emotional side of you is as important as your body so it makes sense that theres another energy source its emotional energy emotional energy is the kind of energy youre looking for anyway its not an adrenalinefilled runaroundlikeanut kind of energy where you burn too brightly its a special energy thats all about feeling young and deeply connected to the fun and hope in life everyones experienced a moment when the chips were down and all you saw ahead was a tough uphill climb and yet you felt full of vitality thats emotional energyan aliveness of the mind a happiness of the heart and a spirit filled with hope how could you possibly feel energetic unless you had that kind of energy isnt this what we all want an energetic mind and heart and soul in an energetic body i call it complete energy complete energy physical energy emotional energy we now know that the physical side is actually the less important part i asked energy experts such as endocrinologists nutritionists and specialists in sports medicine quothow much energy does the typical american get from physical sources and how much from emotional onesquot when i averaged out their answers i was stunned physical energy can supply at most 30 percent of your total energy even if you had perfect physical health and ate the perfect diet and got the perfect amount of exercise all that would give you only 30 percent of the complete energy you need the remaining 70 percent of the energy you need must come from your emotional energy and you need a lot where i first saw that emotional energy matters lets face it life is designed to exhaust our emotional energy most of us work damned hard we have obligations to our family and friends we join organizations we have dreams and ambitions we push ourselves to achieve sometimes just when we think were stretched to the limit some disaster or emergency stretches us even further a family member gets sick we get laid off someone we love dumps us a pet project fails one step forward two steps back and yet we all know people filled with verve and joy in spite of all this thats the difference emotional energy makes i think you have to see people thriving in spite of difficult circumstances to really appreciate it i started seeing this when i was a kid and its always stayed with me i grew up poor in new york city my mother and i were refugees from europe she started out working in a garment factory twelve hours a day everyone in our neighborhood was an immigrant everyone had it tough life could really get to people but if our world was a constant struggle to find work pay the rent educate the children and afford clothes you werent ashamed to wear people reacted to it very differently some were so exhausted they gave up trying some kept on pushing but thats all it waspushing they were running on empty you saw it in their selfpity their rage their constant anxiety their utter discouragement you saw it in their burnedout eyes like soldiers whove spent too many days in combat so are we fools to wish we had more energy should we all just declare the human condition permanently pooped no growing up i also saw people who in spite of everything were filled with a special kind of inner energy they led the same lives as everyone else but still they had hopes and dreams still they made good things happen still they found ways to make themselves happy and stay upbeat my uncle morris was like this he worked long hours managing a laundry his wife was a crazy troublemakereveryone said so his kids were no bargains everything in his life was a struggle but he was always emotionally vibrant he kept working on plans for owning his own business he was always taking us on trips to the country he was always singing and teaching us new songs and whenever he visited he took the trouble to bring a box of candy or cookies especially for me highenergy people have high emotional energy im sure you too know people who have plenty of energy no matter what as if theyd found a secret stash im talking about people who do a lot are upbeat and get a lot of enjoyment from what they do even though so many forces in life seem to be against them but we dont think of them as living in an unattainable stratosphere theres something about being filled with energy that makes us feel quotyeah i can see myself like thatquot we know intuitively that emotional energy is our birthright we wish we knew these peoples secrets because of the enormous difference we know emotional energy makes in their lives and that difference is the emotional energy factor a man spends his life hanging in there working at a job he doesnt like struggling to support his family and all the while he remains cheerful never complaining without emotional energy this man wouldve become just another miserable angry guy a young woman spends years trying to find herself to figure out what work she wants to do and how she wants to live its confusing and it should be discouraging but she hangs in there full of hope knowing that every person can find a life that fits without emotional energy this young woman would have given up a man spends years dealing with a chronic debilitating physical condition and yet radiates warmth and hope instead of spreading gloom he spreads joy without emotional energy he mightve collapsed physically and become bitter cold and lonely its wimbledon the deciding match of the mens finals two worldclass tennis players have been going full out for hours both are in superb physical shape but at this stage in a grueling competition that stretches the human soul to its limit one player will keep on finding the fun in the game will keep on wanting to win the most without emotional energy the winner wouldve been the loser look at some of the greatest artists producing beauty out of darkness joy out of misery there are many like the painter renoir who was racked with pain from arthritis almost unable to hold a brush in his hands or rembrandt who struggled with loneliness and poverty yet both worked for years producing one radiant masterpiece after another then there were beethoven and mozart both of them produced some of their most shining happy music during times when the circumstances of their lives were most desperate and filled with loss many great artists have had difficult lives without emotional energy think of all the great art that never would have been born a scientist or inventor faces years of heart and spiritbreaking frustration and yet keeps on trying until he finally reaches the brass ring hes been struggling toward without emotional energy almost no difficult scientific or technological problem would have been solved an innercity woman works at lowpaying jobs and brings up six children sending them all to college and thats the easy part the hard part is that all the while she inculcates in them a loving hopeful spirit without emotional energy life would crush many of us think about a person so passionate for a cause that he or she fights for it in spite of everything gandhi is an examplehe spent long periods of time fasting depriving his body of energy yet finding an energy source that enabled him to fight the british empire without emotional energy wed all be stuck with every form of injustice why has anne frank touched so many of us its not just because of what happened to hersimilar stories happened to millions but in spite of the most oppressive conditions we can read from her own pen how she radiates a kind of hope and spunk without emotional energy the human spirit could not survive for long the more pressures you have to deal with the more important it is to take care of your emotional energy as you can see its the most precious form of energy you have its the kind you need the most of its the kind that makes your life feel satisfying and enables you to do something with it having emotional energy changes everything every dimension of who you are feels better the more emotional energy you have lets start with your body suppose youve been working unusually hard long hours not enough sleep not enough healthy food well this is where emotional energy comes to the rescue if theres a group at the office working this hard those with the most emotional energy will feel the best and be able to keep on going the longest this makes sense why do people poop out its not just physical exhaustion the first ones to drop out are the ones who get discouraged and feel most emotionally drained emotional energy comes to the rescue when the body has reached its limits in fact ive seen people damaged by disease whose physical energy has been beaten into the ground but who are able to fight on because their emotional energy gives them the hum and spark they need laura hillenbrand wrote a bestselling book while in the midst of suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome it was so bad that in interviews she talked about quotmy broken bodyquot on her best days she had only enough physical energy to drag herself out of bed to write at her computer for an hour or two but ah the miracle of emotional energy she had a story she cared about the joy of sharing it filled her with energy the fun of playing with words and anecdotes gave her fuel and so she wrote seabiscuit about an unlikely horse who became a champion no one who reads this book could imagine it had been written by someone crippled by an extreme deprivation of physical energy but thats the power of emotional energy
