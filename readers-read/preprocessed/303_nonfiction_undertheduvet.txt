 paperback writher when people ask me what i do for a crust and i tell them that im a novelist they immediately assume that my life is a nonstop carousel of limos television appearances hairdos devoted fans stalkers and all the glitzy paraphernalia of being a public figure its time to set the record straight i write alone in a darkened bedroom wearing my pjs eating bananas my laptop on a pillow in front of me occasionally it usually coincides with promoting a book i am led blinking into the daylight and when i try to talk to people discover that im not able to that ive become completely desocialized and as for being mobbed by adoring fans im never recognized once i thought i was but i was mistaken i was in a shoe shop where else and when i asked one of the girls if she had any of these sixteen shoes in my size she looked at me put her hand on her chest and gave a little gasp its you she declared it is i thought thrilled to the marrow it is me im famous yes the girl continued you were in the pub last night you were the one singing werent you i was so disappointed i could hardly speak id been nowhere near any pub the night before youve a great voice she said now what size do you want these shoes in even the day a book comes out isnt as lifealtering as id once anticipated the morning my first book watermelon was officially published in england where i lived at the time i halfexpected that people in the street would look at me differently as i went to work that theyd nudge each other and mutter see her thats that marian keyes shes written a book and that the bus conductor might let me off my fare youre ok there writer girl this ones on me but naturally no one paid me the slightest attention at lunchtime i rushed to the nearest bookshop my heart aflutter as i expected to see my beloved creation in a massive display instead i found the latest john grisham piled high where my book should have been i looked for a smaller display of my book none to be seen mortified i went to the shelf and searched alphabetically and found it wasnt there so i went to the counter and got the girl to look it up on the computer oh that she said eyeing the screen were not getting any in i can order you a copy though she called after me as i slunk away to shoot myself for a couple of weeks afterward whenever my boss left the office i grabbed the phone and systematically rang every bookshop in london pretending to be a customer asking if they stocked watermelon and if they hadnt got it i rang again a few days later hoping theyd changed their minds in the end im sure they recognized my voice i imagined them putting their hands over the mouthpiece and shouting its that keyes one again have we got her bloody book in yet as well as expecting glitz and glamour i used to think that an integral part of being a writer was lying around on a couch eating chocolate raisins waiting for the muse to strike and that if the muse hadnt struck i might as well be watching jerry springer while i was waiting so it came as a nasty shock to discover that if i was waiting for the muse to come acalling it would take several decades to write a book so now muse or no muse i work eight hours a day monday to friday just like i did when i was an accounts clerk the main difference is that i work in bed not because i am a lazy lump ok not just because im a lazy lump but just because the idea of sitting at a desk daunts me and frankly im daunted enough so the bed it is and its worked out nicely so far especially since i started turning myself regularly to avoid bedsores most days i start work at about eight oclock kicking the day off with a good dose of terror today is the day i usually think when i run out of ideas when the inspiration packs its bags and goes to find another accounts clerk and transforms their life people often ask me where i get my ideas from and god i wish i knew all i can say is that i find people fascinating and seeing as i write about emotional landscapes this can only be a good thing i think that on a subconscious level im taking in information constantly and in case i come across extraspecially interesting people or funny sayings i carry a notebook with me at all times well actually i dont im supposed to and when i give advice to aspiring writers thats always what i tell them to do but somehow when i forage around amongst the sweet papers and lip glosses in my handbag the notebook is never there so my office ie the floor on my side of the bed is littered with bus tickets and pastille wrappers with little notes to myself scribbled on them another question that im often asked is if theres any downside to being a writer three words the crippling insecurity in my old job i worked in accounts it may not have been the most exciting job in the universe but it was very reassuring if it balanced i knew i was right it was as simple as that but with writing theres no right or wrong
