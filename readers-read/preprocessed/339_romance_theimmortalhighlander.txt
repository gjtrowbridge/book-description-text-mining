 cincinnati ohio several months later 1 summer gabrielle o8217callaghan brooded8212always her favorite season8212had absolutely sucked this year unlocking her car she got in and slipped off her sunglasses shrugging out of her suit jacket she nudged off her heels and took slow deep breaths she sat collecting herself for a few moments then tugged free the clip restraining her hair and massaged her scalp she was getting the start of a killer headache and her hands were still shaking she8217d nearly betrayed herself to the fae she couldn8217t believe she8217d been so stupid but god there were just too many of them this summer she hadn8217t spotted a fairy in cincinnati for years but now for some bizarre reason there were oodles of them like cincinnati was some kind of great place to hang out8212could a city be more boring whatever their unfathomable reason for choosing the tristate they8217d appeared in droves in early june and had been ruining her summer ever since and pretending she didn8217t see them never got any easier with their perfect bodies goldvelvet skin and shimmering iridescent eyes they were a little hard to miss dropdead gorgeous impossibly seductive dripping pure power the males were a walking temptation for a girl to8212 brusquely she shook her head to abort that treacherous thought she8217d survived this long and was darned if she was going to slip up and get caught by one of the erotic8212exotic she corrected herself impatiently8212creatures but sometimes it was so hard not to look at them and doubly difficult not to react especially when one caught her off guard like the last one had she8217d been having lunch with marian temple senior partner at the law firm of temple turley and tucker at a posh downtown restaurant a very critical lunch during which she8217d been interviewing for a postgraduate position a soontobethirdyear law student gabby was serving a summer internship with little amp staller a local firm of personal injury attorneys it had taken her all of two days on the job to realize she was not cut out for representing pushy medbillinflating plaintiffs who were firmly convinced their softtissue injuries were worth at least a million dollars per ache at the opposite end of the legal spectrum was temple turley and tucker the most prestigious firm in the city it catered to only the most desirable clients specializing in business law and estate planning what carefully selected criminal cases they chose to represent were renowned precedentsetting ones ones that made a difference in the world protecting fundamental rights and addressing intolerable injustices and those were the cases she hungered to get her hands on even if she had to slave away for years doing research and fetching coffee to get to them she8217d been stressed all week anticipating the interview knowing that ttampt hired only the cream of the crop knowing she was competing against dozens of her classmates not to mention dozens more from law schools around the country in a cutthroat bid for a single opening knowing marian temple had a reputation for demanding nothing less than highgloss sophistication and professional perfection but thanks to hours of aggressive practice interviews and pep talks from her best friend elizabeth gabby had been calm composed and in top form the aloof ms temple had been impressed with her scholastic achievements and gabby had gotten the distinct impression that the firm was predisposed to hire a woman couldn8217t be too careful with those equalopportunity statistics which put her ahead of most of the competition the lunch had gone swimmingly until the moment they8217d left the restaurant and stepped out onto fifth street as ms temple was extending that allimportant invitation to come in for a second inhouse interview with the partners which was never arranged unless the firm was seriously considering making an offer joy of joys a sexy musclebound fairy male sauntered right between them in that infuriatingly arrogant i8217msoperfect don8217tyoujustwishyouwereme way they had so close that its long golden hair brushed gabby8217s cheek like a sensual ripple of silk the intoxicating fragrance of jasmine and sandalwood surrounded her and the heat radiating off its powerful body caressed her like a sultry erotic breeze it took every ounce of her considerable selfdiscipline to not inch backward out of its way or worse8212yield to that incessant temptation and just pet the gorgeous tawny creature how many times had she dreamed of doing that copping one tiny forbidden fairyfeel finally finding out if all that golden fairy skin really felt as velvety as it looked you must never betray that you can see them gabby thoroughly discombobulated by the fairy8217s proximity her suddenly nerveless hand lost its grip on the iced coffee she8217d taken from the restaurant in a togo cup it hit the sidewalk the top flew off and coffee exploded upward drenching the impeccable ms temple at that precise moment the fairy turned back to look at her its iridescent eyes narrowing panicked gabby focused all her attention on the sputtering ms temple with the enthusiasm of nearhysteria she plucked tissues from her purse and dabbed frantically at the spreading coffee stains on what had been moments before a pristine ivory suit that she had a sick feeling cost more than she made in a month babbling loudly about how clumsy she was apologizing and blaming everything from eating too much to not being used to heels to being nervous about the interview in a matter of moments she managed to completely blow the image of cool composed confidence she8217d so painstakingly projected through lunch but she8217d had no choice in order to make the fairy believe she hadn8217t seen it that she was just a clumsy human nothing more she8217d had to act like a complete spaz and risk sabotaging her credibility with her prospective employer sabotage it she had swatting away gabby8217s frantically dabbing hands ms temple smoothed her ruined suit and huffed off toward her car pausing to toss stiffly over her shoulder 8220as i told you earlier ms o8217callaghan our firm works with only the highest caliber clients they can be demanding excessive and temperamental and understandably so when there are millions at stake a client has every right to expect the best we at temple turley and tucker pride ourselves on being unflappable under stress our clients require smooth sophisticated handling frankly ms o8217callaghan you8217re too flighty to be successful with our firm i8217m sure you8217ll find an appropriate fit elsewhere good day ms o8217callaghan8221 feeling like she8217d been kicked in the stomach gabby watched in stricken silence as ms temple accepted her spotless mercedes from the valet dimly registering that the fairy blessedly was also moving on as the sleek pearlcolored mercedes merged onto fifth street and disappeared into traffic8212the job of her dreams flapping farewell on its tailpipe8212gabby8217s shoulders slumped with a gusty sigh she turned and trudged down the street to the corner lot where simple law students notdestinedforsuccessbecausetheyweretooflighty could afford to park 8220 8216flighty8217 my ass8221 she muttered resting her head on the steering wheel 8220you have no idea what my life is like you can8217t see them8221 all ms temple had probably felt was a slight breeze a moderate increase in temperature perhaps caught a whiff of an exotic arousing fragrance and if by chance the fairy had brushed against her8212although they were invisible they were real and were actually there8212ms temple would have rationalized it away somehow those who couldn8217t see the fae always did gabby had learned the hard way that people had zero tolerance for the inexplicable it never ceased to amaze her what flimsy excuses they dredged up to protect their perception of reality 8220gee i guess i didn8217t get enough sleep last night8221 or 8220wow i shouldn8217t have had that second or third or fourth beer with lunch8221 if all else failed they settled for a simple 8220i must have imagined it8221 how she longed for such oblivion she shook her head and tried to console herself with the thought that at least the fairy had been convinced and was gone she was safe for now the way gabby figured it the fae were responsible for ninetynine percent of the problems in her life she8217d take responsibility for the other one percent but they were the reason her life this summer had been one crisis after another they were the reason she8217d begun to dread leaving her house never knowing where one might pop up or how badly it might startle her or what kind of ass she8217d make of herself trying to regroup they were the reason her boyfriend had broken up with her fifteen days three hours and8212she glanced broodingly at her watch8212fortytwo minutes ago gabrielle o8217callaghan harbored a special and very personal hatred for the fae 8220i don8217t see you i don8217t see you8221 she muttered beneath her breath as two mouthwatering fairy males strolled past the hood of her car she averted her gaze caught herself then angled the rearview mirror and pretended to be fussing with her lipstick never look away too sharply her grandmother moira o8217callaghan had always cautioned you must act natural you must learn to let your gaze slide over them without either hitching or pulling away too abruptly or they8217ll know you know and they8217ll take you you must never betray that you can see them promise me gabby i can8217t lose you gram had seen them too these creatures other people couldn8217t see most of the women on her mom8217s side did though sometimes the 8220gift8221 skipped generations as it had with her mom who8217d moved to los angeles years ago like the people in california were less weird than fairies leaving then8211sevenyearold gabrielle behind with gram 8220until she got settled8221 jilly o8217callaghan had never gotten settled why couldn8217t it have skipped me gabby brooded a normal life was all she8217d ever wanted and proving damned difficult to have even in boring cincinnati gabby was beginning to think that living in the tristate8212the geographical convergence of indiana ohio and kentucky8212was a bit like living at the mystical convergence of sunnydale8217s hellmouth except the midwest didn8217t get demons and vampires8212oh no8212they got fairies dangerously seductive inhuman arrogant creatures that would take her and do godonlyknewwhat to her if they ever figured out that she could see them her family history was riddled with tales of ancestors who8217d been captured by the dreaded fae hunters and never seen again some of the tales claimed they were swiftly and brutally killed by the savage hunters others that they were forced into slavery to the fae she had no idea what actually became of those foolish enough to be taken but she knew one thing for certain she had no intention of ever finding out later gabby would realize that it was all the cup of coffee8217s fault every awful thing that happened to her from that moment on could be traced directly back to that cup of coffee with the stunning simplicity of an airtight conditional argument if not for a said cup of coffee then not b blowing job interview hence not c having to go into work that night and certainly not d the horrible thing that happened to her there on to infinity it really wasn8217t fair that such a trivial spurofthemoment seemingly harmless decision such as taking an iced coffee togo could change the entire course of a girl8217s life not that she didn8217t hold the fairy significantly culpable but studying law had taught her to isolate the critical catalyst so one could argue culpability and the simple facts were that if she hadn8217t had the cup of coffee in her hand she wouldn8217t have dropped it wouldn8217t have splattered ms temple wouldn8217t have made an ass of herself and wouldn8217t have lost all hope of landing her dream job if not for the cup of coffee the fairy would have had no reason to turn and look back at her and she would have had no reason to panic life would have rolled smoothly on with the promise of that coveted second interview she would have gone out celebrating with her girlfriends that night but because of that nefarious cup of coffee she didn8217t go out she went home took a long bubble bath had a longer cry then later that evening when she was certain the office would be empty and she wouldn8217t have to field humiliating questions from her fellow interns she drove back downtown to catch up on work she was behind by a whopping nineteen arbitration cases which now that she didn8217t have a different job lined up mattered and because of that calamitous cup of coffee she was in a bad mood and not paying attention as she parallelparked in front of her office building and she didn8217t notice the dark dangerouslooking fairy stepping from the shadows of the adjacent alley if not for the stupid cup of coffee she wouldn8217t have even been there and that was when things took a diabolical turn from bad to worse
