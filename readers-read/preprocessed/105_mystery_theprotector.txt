 shoes and watches cavanaugh had learned a long time ago that one of the secrets of being a capable protective agent was to pay attention to shoes and watches loafers for example somebody wearing them was unlikely to be a trained kidnapper or assassin because an experienced runnerandgunner knew how easy it was to lose loafers in a chase or a fight only boots or laceup shoes were acceptable thin soles were a further indication that someone was unlikely to be a serious threat thick soles being mandatory in a fight of course somebody wearing loafers or thinsoled shoes could still be a threat but at least cavanaugh would know he was dealing with an amateur similarly watches told cavanaugh a lot many operators trained in the 1970s and 80s wore either rolex divers watches or rolex pilots watches the rationale was twofold first those watches had a reputation for functioning under rugged conditions an essential requirement for a runnerandgunner second in an emergency a rolex became portable wealth easily sold for cash not that everyone wearing a rolex aroused cavanaughs suspicions they had to be in their forties or older fitting the age profile of someone whod been trained during the seventies and eighties also operators from that era tended to prefer sneakers jeans tshirts and windbreakers often leather for their casual street clothes the windbreaker would be loose capable of concealing a handgun to the untutored eye someone who fit that description wouldnt seem unusual but to cavanaugh that person caused concern operators trained in the 1990s and afterward had a different profile they were younger of course and the watch they preferred was cheap and anonymous but capable of taking a beating the sort of rubbercoated divers watch that had a timer function and could be bought in any decent sportinggoods store they preferred hiking boots tough thick soles loosefitting camping pants with baggy pockets to conceal a weapon a loose pullover to conceal a weapon and a fanny pack to conceal a weapon given the poor fashion sense of most people on the street anyone who matched this profile didnt stand out except to a protective agent like cavanaugh who instantly placed them under suspicion watches so much could be revealed by them cavanaugh had once been on a protective detail in istanbul his assignment had been to help provide security for an american billionaire who had gone to istanbul to negotiate a corporate merger despite threats against the mans life because of his muchpublicized financial support of israel before the billionaires jet arrived at istanbuls airport cavanaugh had checked the busy concourse and the area outside the variety of clothes that the crowd woretraditional arab robes as well as numerous types of western dress made it hard to find a telltale common denominator but watches cavanaugh knew seldom lied when he noticed half a dozen men in their thirties who wore dissimilar but baggy clothes who appeared not to have anything to do with one another but who all had similar thicksoled shoes and the same type of sturdy black rubbercoated athletes watch alarms went off inside him warning him that he had to find another way to get his client out of the airport it wasnt something cavanaugh did consciously it was his reflexive way of seeing the world much as the legendary security expert col jeff cooper advised everyone to maintain a state of vigilance that cooper called condition yellow white being the average persons lack of awareness orange being intense alertness in response to danger and red being a fight for ones life in condition yellow then observing shoes watches and other indicators cavanaugh got out of a taxi at columbus circle and walked into central park the time was around two in the afternoon the route he took through the trees avoided paths and was intended to let him know if he was being followed he exited at west seventieth street and crisscrossed blocks at random heading south eventually climbing the steps from columbus avenue and starting across the huge open area in front of lincoln center one benefit of this cautious frame of mind was that it kept him solidly in the moment appreciative of each second not only aware of the crowd that was typically in front of lincoln center but also aware of the unusually clear sky of the pleasant feel of the sun on this splendid may afternoon he crossed to the famous fountain sat with his back to it and considered what was going on around him two young men threw a frisbee back and forth students presumably from nearby juilliard sat on benches reading textbooks busylooking people crossed back and forth from the various buildings couples chatted turning cavanaugh saw a businessman sitting behind him on the edge of the fountain the man had a briefcase in his lap and glanced at his watch out of habit cavanaugh shifted so he could pay closer attention the man was in his thirties of medium height and weight with short dark hair any number of businessmen fit that profile his black suit looked expensive and fit him perfectly no place to hide a weapon the mans black briefcase also looked expensive and was shiny enough to be brandnew when the man crossed his legs cavanaugh was able to study one of his shoes a sturdy black oxford so new that the sole was barely scraped and as for the watch cavanaugh didnt mind that it was one of those shiny types with all sorts of dials and buttons true a certain level of businessman preferred to be unostentatious but others liked to indulge themselves with gadgets and a watch capable of being a timer while it also indicated the hour minute and second in two different time zones could be amusing for a certain type of mind no what bothered cavanaugh was that the watch was so thick the shirtsleeve around it had to be unbuttoned looking sloppy in contrast to the mans otherwiseimpeccable appearance the man checked his watch again then directed his attention to the left toward the entrance to avery fisher hall one of the buildings in the complex at that moment cavanaugh sensed someone coming toward him and peered up at a tall slender man who had a slight mustache and a widebrimmed hat that cavanaugh knew hid thinning gray hair although the man was in his fifties he exuded the wiry strength of someone much younger his shoes were so polished that they reflected the movement of people walking past his gray pinstriped suit gave the impression of a uniform his white shirt was heavily starched the only colors were the red and blue of his tie which didnt relieve his pallor duncan cavanaugh smiled and shook hands with him you look pasty you need to get outside more bad for my health the brim of duncans hat cast his face in shadow his last name was wentworth and because hed spent much of his life outdoors as a member of special forces and later as the head instructor for delta force hed had three operations for serious skin cancer youre far too tan put on more sunblock yeah the ozone layers getting thinner one more thing to worry about cavanaugh glanced again toward the man in the black suit sitting behind him on the edge of the

resist grinning anytime you start buttering me up it means you want something duncan gave him a guilty as charged look do you think youre ready to go back to work taking another glance over his shoulder cavanaugh noticed that the man in the black suit looked more intense as he checked his watch yet again and continued staring toward avery fisher hall the open cuff around the thick watch became more bothersome at once the man saw something that made him sit rigidly with the briefcase on his lap he placed his hands on the buttons that would open it excuse me a minute cavanaugh said to duncan he stood and rounded the fountain following the mans gaze toward avery fisher hall and a redhaired woman who had just stepped out in her thirties well dressed and pleasantlooking she was with a man whom she gave a see you later kiss on the cheek then she started across the open area in ten seconds she would pass through the crowd and be close to where the man in the black suit sat staring at her cavanaugh came up on his blind side as the man opened the briefcase just enough to reach inside it the woman came closer and glanced in the mans direction amazing cavanaugh inasmuch as most people never noticed anything around them she froze as the man dropped the briefcase revealing a pistol in his hand several things happened almost at once the woman screamed the man moved toward her and cavanaugh darted behind him shoving his arm into the air he wrenched the pistol from the mans hand dragged him backward tipped him into the fountain and pressed his head underwater duncan came over to
