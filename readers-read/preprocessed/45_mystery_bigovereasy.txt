it was the week following easter if queen anne hadnrsquot suffered so badly from gout and dropsy reading might never have developed at all in 1702 the unhealthy queen anne looking for a place to ease her royal infirmities chanced upon bath and where royalty goes so too does society in consequence reading up until that time a small town on a smaller tributary of the thames became a busy staging post on the bath road later to become the a4 and ultimately the m4 the town was enriched by the wool trade and later played host to several large firms that were to become household names by the time huntley palmers biscuits began here in 1822 simonds brewery was already well established and when suttons seeds began in 1835 and sponggs footcare in 1853 the towns prosperity was assured excerpt from a history of reading it was the week following easter in reading and no one could remember the last sunny day gray clouds swept across the sky borne on a chill wind that cut like a knife it seemed that spring had forsaken the town the drab winter weather had clung to the town like a heavy smog refusing to relinquish the season even the early bloomers were in denial only the bravest crocuses had graced the municipal park and the daffodils usually a welcome splash of color after a winter of grayness had taken one sniff at the cold damp air and postponed blooming for another year a police officer was gazing with mixed emotions at the dreary cityscape from the seventh floor of reading central police station she was thirty and attractive dressed up and dated down worked hard and felt awkward near anyone she didnt know her name was mary mary mary and she was from basingstoke which is nothing to be ashamed of mary said an officer who was carrying a large potted plant in the manner of someone who thinks it is well outside his job description superintendent briggs will see you now how often do you water these things that one replied mary without emotion never itrsquos plastic irsquom a policeman he said unhappily not a sodding gardener and he walked off mumbling darkly to himself she turned from the window approached briggss closed door and paused she gathered her thoughts took a deep breath and stood up straight reading wouldnt have been everyones choice for a transfer but for mary reading had one thing that no other city possessed dci friedland chymes he was a veritable powerhouse of a sleuth whose career was a catalog of inspired police work and his unparalleled detection skills had filled the newspaper columns for over two decades chymes was the reason mary had joined the police force in the first place ever since her father had bought her a subscription to amazing crime stories when she was nine shed been hooked she had thrilled at the mystery of the wrong nose been galvanised by the poisoned shoe and inspired by the sign of three and a half twentyone years further on friedland was still a serious international player in the world of competitive detecting and mary had never missed an issue chymes was currently ranked by amazing crime second in their annual league rating just behind oxfords everpopular inspector moose hmm murmured superintendent briggs eyeing marys job application carefully as she sat uncomfortably on a plastic chair in an office that was empty apart from a desk two chairs them and a trombone lying on a tattered chaise longue your application is mostly very good mary he said approvingly i see you were with detective inspector hebden flowwe how did that go it hadnrsquot gone very well at all but she didnrsquot think shersquod say so we had a fairly good clearup rate sir irsquove no doubt you did but more important anything published it was a question that was asked more and more in front of promotion boards and transfer interviews and listed in performance reports it wasnt enough to be a conscientious and invaluable assistant to ones allotted inspectormdashyou had to be able to write up a readable account for the magazines that the public loved to read preferably amazing crime stories but failing that sleuth illustrated only one story in print sir but i was the youngest officer at basingstoke to make detective sergeant and have two commendations for brav the thing is interrupted briggs is that the oxford berkshire police prides itself on producing some of the most readable detectives in the country he walked over to the window and looked out at the rain striking the glass modern policing isnt just about catching criminals mary itrsquos about good copy and ensuring that cases can be made into topnotch documentaries on the telly public approval is the allimportant currency these days and police budgets ebb and flow on the back of circulation and viewing figures yes sir ds flotsams work penning friedland chymess adventures is the benchmark by which you should try to aspire mary selling the movie rights to friedland chymesthe smell of fear was a glory moment for everyone at reading central and rightly so just one published work you say with flowwe yes sir a twoparter in amazing crime janfeb 1999 and adapted for tv he nodded his approval well thatrsquos impressive primetime dramatization no sir documentary on molecable62 his face fell clearly at reading they expected better things briggs sat down and looked at her record again now it says here one reprimand you struck detective inspector flowwe with an onyx ashtray why was that the table lamp was too heavy she replied truthfully enough and if irsquod used a chair it might have killed him which is illegal of course added briggs glad for an opportunity to show off his legal knowledge what happened personal entanglements equal blame on both sides sir she replied thinking it would be better to be impartial over the whole affair i was foolish he was emotionally dishonest briggs closed the file well i donrsquot blame you hebden was always a bit of a bounder he pinged my partners bra strap at an office party once you know she wasnt wearing it at the time he added after a moments reflection but the intention was clear that sounds like di flowwe replied mary briggs drummed his fingers on the desk for a moment do you want to hear me play the trombone might it be prejudicial to my career if i were to refuse itrsquos a distinct possibility then irsquod be delighted so briggs walked over to the chaise longue picked up the trombone worked the slide a couple of times and blew a few notes much to the annoyance of whoever had the office next door who started to thump angrily on the wall drug squad explained briggs unhappily putting the instrument down complete heathens never appreciate a good tune i was wondering said mary before he had a chance to start playing again this detective sergeants job im applying for who is it with he looked at his watch an excellent question in ten minutes were holding a press conference ive a detective in urgent need of a new sergeant and i think youll fit the bill perfectly shall we the pressroom was five floors below and an expectant journalistic hubbub greeted their ears while they were still walking down the corridor they stepped inside and stood as unobtrusively as possible at the back of the large and airy room mary could see from the oxford berkshire policebedecked podium and high turnout that press conferences here were taken with a great deal more seriousness than she had known which probably reflected this citys preeminence over basingstoke when it came to serious crime it wasnt that reading had any more murders than basingstokeit just had better ones reading and the thames valley area was more of a fairy cakes laced with strychnine or strangulation with a silk handkerchief sort of place where there were always bags of interesting suspects convoluted motives and seemingly insignificant clues hidden in an inquiry of incalculable complexity yet solved within a week or two by contrast murders in basingstoke were strictly blunt instruments drunkenly wielded solved within the houror not at all mary had worked on six murder investigations and to her great disappointment hadnrsquot once discovered one of those wonderful clues that seem to have little significance but later in an epiphanic moment turn the case on its head and throw the guilty light on someone previously eliminated from the inquiries she didnrsquot have time how to muse upon the imaginative shortcoming of basingstokes criminal fraternity any longer as there was a sudden hushing of the pressmen a burst of spontaneous applause and a handsome man in his midfifties strode dramatically from a side door goodness said mary thatrsquos yup said briggs with the pride of a father who has just seen his son win everything at sports day detective inspector friedland chymes friedland chymes in person there was a hush as the famous detective stepped up to the podium the assembled two dozen newspapermen readied themselves pens poised for his statement thank you for attending he began sweeping back his blond hair and gazing around the room with his lively blue eyes causing flutters when they lingered ever so slightly with the women present in the room mary included she found herself almost automatically attracted to him he was strong handsome intelligent fearlessthe most alpha of alpha males working with him would be an honor it was the small traces of pastry around the gunshot wound on colonel peabodys body that turned the case for me began the great detective his sonorous tones filling the air like music minute quantities of shortcrust whose butterflour ratio i found to be identical to a mediumsize bowyers pork pie the assailant had fired his weapon through the tasty snack to muffle the sound of the shot the report heard later was a firecracker set off by a time fuse thus giving an alibi to the assailant who i can reveal to you now was the whole room leaned forward in expectation chymes his only apparent vanity a certain showmanship paused for dramatic effect before announcing the killer miss celia mangersen the victimrsquos niece and unbeknownst to us all the sole beneficiary of the missing will which i found hiddenas expectedwithin a hollowedout statuette of sir walter scott yes mr hatchett you have a question josh hatchett of the toad newspaper had raised his hand in the front row what was the significance of the traces of custard found on the colonels sock suspender friedland raised a finger in the air an excellent question mr hatchett and one that pushed my deducting powers to the limit bear with me if you will while we go through the final moments of colonel peabodys life mortally wounded and with only seconds to live he had somehow to leave a clue to his assailants identity a note of course notthe killer would find and destroy it guessing correctly that a murder of this magnitude would be placed in my hands he decided to leave behind a clue that only i could solve knowing the colonels penchant for anagrams it was but a swift move to deduct his reasoning the sock suspender was made in france custard in french is cregraveme anglaiseand an anagram of this is celia mangerse which not only correctly identified the killer but also told me the colonel died before he was able to finish the anagram there was more applause and he quietened everyone down before continuing but since anagramrelated clues are now inadmissible as evidence we sent the pork pie off for dna analysis and managed to pinpoint the pie shop where it was purchased guessing that miss mangersen might have an affinity for the pies we staked out the shop in question and yesterday evening miss mangersen was taken into custody whereupon she confessed to me in a tearful scene that served as a dramatic closure to the case my loyal chirpy cockney assistant and biographer ds flotsam will of course be writing a full report for amazing crime stories in due course after the formality of a trial ladies and gentlemen the case is closed the assembled journalists rose as one and burst into spontaneous applause chymes dismissed the adulation with a modest wave of the hand and excused himself muttering something about needing to open a hospital for orphaned sick children hes amazing breathed mary somehow convincing herselfas had all the other women presentthat chymes had winked at her across the crowded room i agree replied briggs standing aside as the newsmen filed out eager to get the stories into the late editions donrsquot you love that the case is closed stuff i wish i had a catchphrase hersquos an asset not only to us here at reading but also to the nationthere arent many countries that havent requested his thoughts on some intractable and ludicrously complex inquiry hes remarkable agreed mary indeed went on briggs seemingly swept up in a paroxysm of hagiographic hero worship hes also a hilarious raconteur has a golf handicap of two was twice world aerobatic champion and plays the clarinet as well as artie shaw speaks eight languages too and is often consulted by the jellyman himself on important matters of state irsquom going to enjoy working with him i can see replied mary happily when do i start chymes echoed briggs with a faint yet unmistakably patronizing laugh goodness gracious no yoursquore not working with chymes who then asked mary attempting to hide her disappointment and failing him mary followed briggsrsquos outstretched finger to an untidy figure who had taken his turn at the podium he was in his midforties had graying hair and one eye marginally higher than the other giving him the lopsided look of someone deep in thought if he was deep in thought considered mary it was clearly about something more important than his personal appearance his suit could have done with a good pressing his hair styled any way but the way he had it he might have shaved a little less hurriedly and made more of an attempt to exude someanyconfidence he fumbled with his papers as he stared resignedly after the rapidly vanishing press corps i see said mary sounding a great deal colder than she had intended and whorsquos he briggs patted her arm in a fatherly manner he could sense her disappointment but it wasnrsquot up to him chymes picked his own people thatrsquos di jack spratt of the nursery crime division the ncd yoursquoll be on his team or at least you and a few others will be the team its one of our smallest departments he thought for a moment and then added actually it is our smallest departmentif you dont count the night shift in the canteen and his amazing crime stories rating what about that hersquos not rated replied briggs trying to make it sound all matteroffact and not the embarrassment that it was in fact i dont think hes even in the guild mary stared at the shabby figure and felt her heart fall all of a sudden di flowwe didnrsquot seem quite so bad after all jack spratt looked around the room most of the newsmen had by now left and aside from briggs and a woman spratt didnt recognize at the door there were only two journalists still in the room the first was a large man named archibald fatquack who was the editor of the reading weekly gossip sheet the gadfly the second was a junior newshound from the reading daily eyestrain who appeared to be asleep drunk dead or a mixture of all three thank you all for attending this press conference announced jack in a somber tone to the as goodasempty room ill try not to keep you any longer than is necessary this afternoon the reading central criminal court found the three pigs not guilty of all charges relating to the firstdegree murder of mr wolff he sighed if he was intending it to be a dramatic statement it wasnt and it didnt help that no one significant was there to witness it he could still hear the excited yet increasingly distant chatter of the newsmen as they filed down the corridor but it was soon drowned out by friedlandrsquos 1932 delage d8 super sport which started up with a throaty roar in the car park jack waited until he had gone then continued on gamely the extreme lack of interest not outwardly affecting his demeanor after nearly twenty years he was kind of used to it since the death by scalding of mr wolff following his ill fated climb down little pig cs chimney we at the nursery crime division have been following inquiries that this was not an act of selfdefense but a violent and premeditated murder by three individuals who far from being the innocent victims of wolfporcine crime actually sought confrontation and then acted quite beyond what might be described as reasonable selfdefenserdquo jack paused for breath if he had hoped his misgivings over the outcome of the trial would be splashed all over the paper he was mistaken page sixteen of the gadfly was about the sum total of this particular story sandwiched ignominiously between a threefortwo hemorrelief advert and the very reverend conrad poorsquos weekly dentalhygiene column mr spratt began archibald slowly bringing himself up to speed like a chilled gecko is it true that mr wolff once belonged to the lupine brotherhood a secret society dedicated to traditional wolfish pursuits such as the outlawed midnight howling yes i understand that to be the case replied jack but that was over fifteen years ago we do not deny that he has been investigated over various charges of criminal damage arising from the destruction of two dwellings built by the younger pigs nor that mr wolff threatened to eat them all up but we saw this as an empty threatwe produced witnesses who swore that mr wolff was a vegetarian of many years standing so what was your basis for a murder prosecution again asked archie scratching his head we believed replied jack in exasperation as he had made the same point in the same room to the same two disinterested journalists many times before that boiling mr wolff alive was quite outside the realm of reasonable force and that the fact that the large pan of water would have taken at least six hours to reach boiling point strongly indicated premeditation archibald said nothing and jack eager to go home wrapped up his report despite the notguilty verdicts we at the ncd feel we have put up a robust case and were fully justified in our actions to this end we will not be looking to reexamine the case or interview anyone else in connection with mr wolffrsquos death jack sighed and gazed down he looked and felt drained personally said briggs in an aside i didnrsquot think the jury would go for it the problem is that small pigs elicit a strong sympathetic reaction and large wolves donrsquot there was a good case for selfdefense toomdashmr wolff was trespassing when he climbed down the chimney it really all hinged on whether you believed that the pigs were boiling up a huge tureen of water to do their washing and the jury did in only eight minutes do you want me to introduce you irsquod prefer tomorrow once i am officially on duty said mary quickly thinking she might have to go outside and scream or something briggs picked up on her reticence donrsquot underestimate the nursery crime division mary spratt does some good work not highprofile you understand but important his work on the bluebeard serial wife killings case was mostly good solid police work that was spratt asked mary something vaguely stirring in her memory it hadnrsquot been in amazing crime of course just one of those alsoran stories you usually find dwelling in the skimread part of the dailies along with city prices dog horoscopes and truelife photo stories it had been under the subheading colorfully hirsute gentleman kills nine wives hidden room contained gruesome secret thatrsquos him jack was onto bluebeard and was well ahead of events if nine wives died he couldnrsquot have been that good i said it was mostly good police work more notably he arrested rumplestiltskin over that spinning straw into gold scam and was part of the team that captured the violently dangerous psychopath the gingerbreadman you might have heard about jack in connection with some giant killing too something stirred in maryrsquos memory again and she raised an eyebrow police officers werenrsquot meant to kill people if they could help itmdashand giants were no exception donrsquot worry said briggs it was selfdefense mostly mostly the last one he ran over in a car the last one repeated mary incredulously how many have there been four but donrsquot mention it hersquos a bit sensitive over the issue maryrsquos heart which had already fallen fairly far fell farther well thatrsquos all i have to say said jack to the sparsely populated room are there any more questions archibald fatquack stirred scribbled in his pad but said nothing the reporter from the reading daily eyestrain had moved slowly forward during jacks report until his head was resting on the seat back in front he began to snore good well thank you very much for your time dont all rush to get out you might wake jim over there i wasnrsquot asleep said jim eyes tightly closed i heard every word even the bit about the bears escaping into the oracle center and eating a balloon seller of course he murmured beginning to snore again jack picked up his notes and disappeared through a side door are there usually this few people for his press conferences asked mary horrified at the prospect of the career black hole into which she was about to descend like a suicidal rabbit good lord no replied briggs in a shocked tone often he has no press at all he looked at his watch goodness is that the time check in with me first thing tomorrow and ill introduce you to jack youll like him not exactly charismatic but diligent and generally correct in most some of his assumptions sir i was wonderingmdash briggs stopped her midsentence divining precisely what she was about to say the reason was simple all the detective sergeants he had ever allocated to jack said the same thing look upon it as a baptism of fire the ncd is good training for what briggs had to think for a moment unconventional policing your time wonrsquot be wasted oh and one other thing yes sir welcome to reading
