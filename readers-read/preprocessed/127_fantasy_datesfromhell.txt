 chapter one phone cradled between her shoulder and ear ivy tamwood scooped another chunk of chili up with her fries leaning over the patterned wax paper so it wouldnt drip onto her desk kisten was bitching about something or other and she wasnt listening knowing he could go on for half her lunch break before winding down the guy was nice to wake up to in the afternoon and a delight to play with before the sun came up but he talked too much which is why i put up with him she mused running her tongue across the inside of her teeth before swallowing her world had gone too quickly from alive to silent on that flight back home from california my god was it seven years now it had been unusual to foster a highblood living vampire child into a sympathetic camarilla taking her from home and family for her last two years of high school but piscary the master vampire her family looked to had become too intense in his interest in her before she developed the mental tools to deal with it and her parents had intervened at some cost probably saving her sanity i could keep freud in havana cigars all by my lonesome ivy thought taking another bite of carbs and protein twentythree ought to be far enough away from that scared sixteenyearold on the sundrenched tarmac to forget but even now after multiple blood and bed partners a sixyear degree in social sciences and landing an excellent job where she could use her degree she found her confidence was still tied to the very things that screwed her up she missed skimmer and her reminder that life was more than waiting for it to end so she could get started living and while kisten was nothing like her high school roommate he had filled the gap nicely these last few years smiling wickedly ivy gazed through the plateglass wall that looked out on the floor of open offices weight shifting she crossed her legs at her knees and leaned farther across her desk imagining just what gap shed like kisten to fill next damn vampire pheromones she breathed and pulled herself straight not liking where her thoughts took her when she spent too much time in the lower levels of the inderland security tower working the homicide division of the is got her a real office instead of a desk in the middle of the floor with the peons but there were too many vamps both living and undead down here for the air circulation to handle kistens tirade about prank phone calls ended abruptly what do vamp pheromones have to do with humans attacking my pizza delivery crew he asked in a lousy british accent it was his newest preoccupation and one she hoped hed tire of soon rolling her chair closer to her desk ivy took a swig of her imported bottled water eyes askance on the bosss closed door across the large room nothing you want me to pick up anything on the way home i might be able to wing out of here early arts in the office which means someone died and i have to go to work bet you first bite hes going to want to cut my lunch short she took another sip and im going to take it off the end of my day no kisten said danny is doing the shopping today one of the perks of living atop a restaurant she thought as kisten started in on a shopping list she didnt care about pulling her plate of fries off her desk she set them on her lap being careful to not spill anything on her leather pants the bosss door opened catching her eye when art came out shaking hands with mrs pendleton hed been in there a full half hour there was a stapled pack of paper in his hands and ivys pulse quickened shed been sitting on her ass going over arts unsolved homicides for too long the man had no business being in homicide dead did not equal smart unless being smart was in manipulating us into giving the undead our blood ivy forced herself to keep eating thinking the undead targeted their living vampire kin more out of jealousy than maintaining good human relations as was claimed having been born with the vampire virus embedded into her genome ivy enjoyed a measure of the undeads strengths without the drawbacks of light fatality and pain from religious artifacts though not in line with arts abilities her hearing and strength were beyond a humans and her sense of smell was tuned to the softer flavors of sweat and pheromones the undeads need for blood had been muted from a biological necessity to a bloodlust that imparted a high like no other when sated addictive when mixed with sex her gaze went unbidden to art and he smiled from across the wide floor as if knowing her thoughts his steady advance never shifting and the packet of paper in his hand moving like a banner of intent appetite gone she swiveled her chair to put her back to the room hey kist she said interrupting his comments about dannys recent poor choice of mushrooms change of plans by the amount of paperwork its one of arts cleanup runs i wont be home till sunup again again she mocked fiddling with a colored pen until she realized it telegraphed her mood and set it down with a sharp tap god kisten you make it sound like its every night kisten sighed leave the paperwork for tomorrow love i dont know why you bust your ass so hard youre not moving up until you let artie the smarty go down on you
