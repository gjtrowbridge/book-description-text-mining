youre awfully quiet something wrong nothing that i can pin down but i feel i didnt sleep well last night bad dreams the kind you cant remember afterwards but their aura lingers like a hangover maybe its your book it cant be easy reliving that time and from what ive read its a much more personal account than what you wrote for the paper it is but thats how i want it carly besides i dont think this is about the book151at least not completely what then matt maybe after all these years ive been thinking of him a lot lately wondering and feeling guilty i suppose in a way when i found out they suspected him of murdering me i shouldve come forward you found out way after the fact and when you did try to contact him he was gone no forwarding i know but instead of trying to find out where hed gone i just felt relieved i didnt want to hurt him any more than i already had so hes better off no hedve been better off if id been honest from the first i couldve151 as my aunt nan used to say coulda s woulda s and shoulda s dont amount to a hill of beans i guess but im concerned for natalie my anxietys obvious and it upsets her she hasnt said anything about it to me you know her shes a child who holds everything inside carly dyou think im being irrational youre stressed youll get over it once the book is done will i sometimes i think that given all the terrible things ive done i dont deserve another good nights sleep in this lifetime
