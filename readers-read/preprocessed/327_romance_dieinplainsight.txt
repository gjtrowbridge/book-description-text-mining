 pasadena california january early tuesday morning chapter one lacey quinn looked around her parents gracefully remodeled old pasadena home and gave herself a moment to prepare for the coming storm her mother and father were enjoying a sundappled weekend brunch in the garden room lacey had driven over from the coast and dropped in without warning figuring it would be easier to tell them that way now she wasnt so sure remember that art auction benefit for the friends of moreno county i mentioned last time i was here lacey asked her mother made a noise that said she was listening despite the boring subject although charity benefits were dottie quinns meat and drink her daughters relentless interest in art baffled dottie as much as it irritated her except at the very high end of the trade art was indelibly messy she preferred life well ordered and tasteful what about it her father asked part of lacey wanted to drop the subject the rest of her tensed for a fight in addition to bringing two of her paintings for a showing susa donovan is going to paint a canvas onstage and then auction it off right there with the money going to friends of moreno county coward sneered her inner self you didnt drive all the way from the beach just to announce that brody quinn grunted shuffled the legal papers he was reading and said thats nice nice lacey put her paintstained hands on her equally paintstained jeans dad even postcardsize paintings by la susa sell for more than a quarter of a million a canvas so she gets a nice writeoff giving one to charity brody said so what in addition to donating the painting lacey said through her teeth she has generously agreed to look at any old paintings people bring in sort of like antiques roadshow clever idea dottie said instantly everyone is sure they have a treasure hidden away in the family junk so there should be a huge turnout and lots of press for the event excellent approach ill put it to work for my next charity auction ill even use the name of your little shop lost treasures found lacey managed not to wince her shop wasnt huge but it kept her and her partner shayla carlyle employed and paying taxes while they scoured estate sales and craft fairs both local and distant for stock figuring the conversation no longer needed to include him brody went back to the legal brief he was reading the point is lacey started when she got distracted by a lock of her curly hair springing free of the clip she used to tame the chestnut mass damn automatically she jammed curls back in place and reset the clip if youd just have it cut short and styled dear it would be easier to control dottie said then id have to do it every few weeks and the point is it only costs twenty dollars a painting to have susa look at them dottie adjusted to the changed subject without a pause even better all money donated yes yes and im going to take three paintings in for her to see lacey finished in a rush im sure shell be quite kind to you dottie said after all she has family of her own i believe didnt high style magazine mention six children and various grandchildren not my own paintings lacey said setting her teeth granddads a legal brief slammed down on the patio table as brody stood up the family cat shot out from under brodys chair and vanished into the lush undergrowth of the garden all over again brody said from the beginning laceys chin came up you have a good legal mind do i really need to repeat it what you need to do is convince me that i shouldnt not again dad weve had this argument so many times we could speak each others lines for whatever reasons you think your fathers paintings arent worth wall space i do i think he is was she swallowed his death two years ago was still fresh for her still hurtful sometimes she still thought she saw him from the corner of her eye or across the street or turning down the aisle of the grocery store grandfather was a very fine artist equal to if not better than any of the california plein air impressionists that are hanging in museums on both coasts i believe in him he believed in me honey im sure your father dottie began lacey kept talking without my grandfather id be trying to be something im not a society woman instead of an artist i dont ask you to support my choices with money or hugs but damn it dont act like i need your permission either he left the paintings to me not you he died before i understood how much he meant to me the least i can do is try to resurrect him from undeserved anonymity as an artist still dying to do david quinn biography of an unknown artist brody asked i want to know where i came from i love my family but i dont fit in my sisters do she grinned wryly at her mother two out of three aint bad right lacey her mother said hugging her we love you and i love both of you she said returning the hug but that doesnt mean were the same kind of people the older i get the more like myself i get and the less like either of you grandpa rainbow understood that he understood me at a time when it meant everything now i want the world to understand how great he really was
