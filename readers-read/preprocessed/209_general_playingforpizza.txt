 it was a hospital bedthat much appeared certain though certainty was coming and going it was narrow and hard and there were shiny metal railings standing sentrylike along the sides preventing escape the sheets were plain and very white sanitary the room was dark but sunlight was trying to creep around the blinds covering the window he closed his eyes again even that was painful then he opened them and for a long silent minute or so he managed to keep the lids apart and focus on his cloudy little world he was lying on his back and pinned down by firmly tucked sheets he noticed a tube dangling to his left running down to his hand then disappearing up somewhere behind him there was a voice in the distance out in the hallway then he made the mistake of trying to move just a slight adjustment of the head and it didn8217t work hot bolts of pain hit his skull and neck and he groaned loudly 8220rick are you awake8221 the voice was familiar and quickly a face followed it arnie was breathing on him 8220arnie8221 he said with a weak scratchy voice then he swallowed 8220it8217s me rick thank god you8217re awake8221 arnie the agent always there at the important moments 8220where am i arnie8221 8220you8217re in the hospital rick8221 8220got that but why8221 8220when did you wake up8221 arnie found a switch and a light came on beside the bed 8220i don8217t know a few minutes ago8221 8220how do you feel8221 8220like someone crushed my skull8221 8220close you8217re gonna be fine trust me8221 trust me trust me how many times had he heard arnie ask for trust truth was he8217d never completely trusted arnie and there was no plausible reason to start now what did arnie know about traumatic head injuries or whatever mortal wound someone had inflicted rick closed his eyes again and breathed deeply 8220what happened8221 he asked softly arnie hesitated and ran a hand over his hairless head he glanced at his watch 400 pm so his client had been knocked out for almost twentyfour hours not long enough he thought sadly 8220what8217s the last thing you remember8221 arnie asked as he carefully put both elbows on the bed8217s railing and leaned forward after a pause rick managed to say 8220i remember bannister coming at me8221 arnie smacked his lips and said 8220no rick that was the second concussion two years ago in dallas when you were with the cowboys8221 rick groaned at the memory and it wasn8217t pleasant for arnie either because his client had been squatting on the sideline looking at a certain cheerleader when the play came his way and he was squashed helmetless by a ton of flying bodies dallas cut him two weeks later and found another thirdstring quarterback 8220last year you were in seattle rick and now you8217re in cleveland the browns remember8221 rick remembered and groaned a bit louder 8220what day is it8221 he asked eyes open now 8220monday the game was yesterday do you recall any of it8221 not if you8217re lucky arnie wanted to say 8220i8217ll get a nurse they8217ve been waiting8221 8220not yet arnie talk to me what happened8221 8220you threw a pass then you got sandwiched purcell came on a weakside blitz and took your head off you never saw him8221 8220why was i in the game8221 now that was an excellent question one that was raging on every sports radio show in cleveland and the upper midwest why was he in the game why was he on the team where in the hell did he come from 8220let8217s talk about it later8221 arnie said and rick was too weak to argue with great reluctance his wounded brain was stirring slightly shaking itself from its coma and trying to awaken the browns browns stadium on a very cold sunday afternoon before a record crowd the playoffs no more than that8211the afc title game the ground was frozen hard as concrete and just as cold a nurse was in the room and arnie was announcing 8220i think he8217s snapped out of it8221 8220that8217s great8221 she said without much enthusiasm 8220i8217ll go find a doctor8221 with even less enthusiasm rick watched her leave without moving his head arnie was cracking his knuckles and ready to bolt 8220look rick i need to get going8221 8220sure arnie thanks8221 8220no problem look there8217s no easy way to say this so i8217ll just be blunt the browns called this morning8211wacker8211and well they8217ve released you8221 it was almost an annual ritual now this postseason cutting 8220i8217m sorry8221 arnie said but only because he had to say it 8220call the other teams8221 rick said and certainly not for the first time 8220evidently i won8217t have to they8217re already calling me8221 8220that8217s great8221 8220not really they8217re calling to warn me not to call them i8217m afraid this might be the end of the line kid8221 there was no doubt it was the end of the line but arnie just couldn8217t find the candor maybe tomorrow eight teams in six years only the toronto argonauts dared to sign him for a second season every team needed a backup to their backup quarterback and rick was perfect for the role problems started though when he ventured onto the field 8220gotta run8221 arnie said glancing at his watch again 8220and listen do yourself a favor and keep the television turned off it8217s brutal especially espn8221 he patted his knee and darted from the room outside the door there were two thick security guards sitting in folding chairs trying to stay awake arnie stopped at the nurses8217 station and spoke to the doctor who eventually made his way down the hall past the security guards and into rick8217s room his bedside manner lacked warmth8211a quick check of the basics without much conversation neurological work to follow just another gardenvariety brain concussion isn8217t this the third one 8220i think so8221 rick said 8220thought about finding another job8221 the doctor asked 8220no8221 perhaps you should the doctor thought and not just because of your bruised brain three interceptions in eleven minutes should be a clear sign that football is not your calling two nurses appeared quietly and helped with the tests and paperwork neither said a word to the patient though he was an unmarried professional athlete with notable good looks and a hard body and at that moment when he needed them they could not have cared less as soon as he was alone again rick very carefully began looking for the remote a large television hung from the wall in the corner he planned to go straight to espn and get it over with every movement hurt and not just his head and neck something close to a fresh knife wound ached in his lower back his left elbow the nonthrowing one throbbed with pain sandwiched he felt like he8217d been flattened by a cement truck the nurse was back holding a tray with some pills 8220where8217s the remote8221 rick asked 8220uh the television8217s broke8221 8220arnie pulled the plug didn8217t he8221 8220which plug8221 8220the television8221 8220who8217s arnie8221 she asked as she tinkered with a rather large needle 8220what8217s that8221 rick asked forgetting arnie for a second 8220vicodin it8217ll help you sleep8221 8220i8217m tired of sleeping8221 8220doctor8217s orders okay you need rest and lots of it8221 she drained the vicodin into his iv bag and watched the clear liquids for a moment 8220are you a browns fan8221 rick asked 8220my husband is8221 8220was he at the game yesterday8221 8220yes8221 8220how bad was it8221 8220you don8217t want to know8221 when he awoke arnie was there again sitting in a chair beside the bed and reading the cleveland post at the bottom of the front page rick could barely make out the headline 8220fans storm hospital8221 8220what8221 rick said as forcefully as possible arnie snatched the paper down and bolted to his feet 8220are you okay kid8221 8220wonderful arnie what day is it8221 8220tuesday early tuesday morning how do you feel kid8221 8220give me that newspaper8221 8220what do you want to know8221 8220what8217s going on arnie8221 8220what do you want to know8221 8220everything8221 8220have you watched television8221 8220no you pulled the plug talk to me arnie8221 arnie cracked his knuckles then walked slowly to the window where he barely opened the blinds he peered through them as if trouble were out there 8220yesterday some hooligans came here and made a scene cops handled it well arrested a dozen or so just a bunch of thugs browns fans8221 8220how many8221 8220paper said about twenty just drunks8221 8220and why did they come here arnie it8217s just you and me agent and player the door8217s closed please fill in the blanks8221 8220they found out you were here a lot of folks would like to take a shot at you these days you8217ve had a hundred death threats folks are upset they8217re even threatening me8221 arnie leaned against the wall a flash of smugness because his life was now worth being threatened 8220you still don8217t remember8221 he asked 8220no8221 8220browns are up seventeen to zip over the broncos with eleven minutes to go zip doesn8217t come close to describing the asskicking after three quarters the broncos have eightyone yards in total offense and three count 8217em three first downs anything8221 8220no8221 8220ben marroon is at quarterback because nagle pulled a hamstring in the first quarter8221 8220i remember that now8221 8220with eleven minutes to go marroon gets drilled on a late hit they carry him off no one8217s worried because the browns8217 defense could stop general patton and his tanks you take the field third and twelve you throw a beautiful pass in the flat to sweeney who of course plays for the broncos and forty yards later he8217s in the end zone remember any of this8221 rick slowly closed his eyes and said 8220no8221 8220don8217t try too hard 8220both teams punt then the broncos fumble with six minutes to go on a third and eight you check off at the line and throw to bryce on a hook but the ball is high and is picked off by somebody in a white jersey can8217t recall his name but he sure can run all the way seventeen to fourteen the place is getting tense eighty thousand plus a few minutes earlier they were celebrating first super bowl ever all that jazz broncos kick off browns run the ball three times because cooley ain8217t about to send in a pass play and so the browns punt or try to snap gets fumbled broncos get the ball on the browns8217 thirtyfouryard line which is no problem whatsoever because in three plays the browns8217 defense which is really really pissed at this point stuffs them for fifteen yards out of field goal range broncos punt you take over at your own 6 and for the next four minutes manage to cram the ball into the middle of the defensive line the drive stalls at midfield third and ten forty seconds to go browns are afraid to pass and even more afraid to punt i don8217t know what cooley sends in but you check off again fire a missile to the right sideline for bryce who8217s wide open right on target8221 rick tried to sit up and for a moment forgot about his injuries 8220i still don8217t remember8221 8220right on target but much too hard it hits bryce in the chest bounces up and goodson grabs it gallops to the promised land browns lose twentyone to seventeen you8217re on the ground almost sawed in half they put you on a stretcher and as they roll you off the field half the crowd is booing and the other half is cheering wildly quite a noise never heard anything like it a couple of drunks jump from the stands and rush the stretcher8211they would8217ve killed you8211but security steps in a nice brawl ensues and it too is all over the talk shows8221 rick was slumped over low in the bed lower than ever with his eyes closed and his breathing quite labored the headaches were back along with the sharp pains in the neck and along the spine where were the drugs 8220sorry kid8221 arnie said the room was nicer in the darkness so arnie closed the blinds and reassumed his position in the chair with his newspaper his client appeared to be dead the doctors were ready to release him but arnie had argued strongly that he needed a few more days of rest and protection the browns were paying for the security guards and they were not happy about it the team was also covering the medicals and it wouldn8217t be long before they complained and arnie was fed up too rick8217s career if you could call it that was over arnie got 5 percent and 5 percent of rick8217s salary wasn8217t enough to cover expenses 8220are you awake rick8221 8220yes8221 he said with his eyes still closed 8220listen to me okay8221 8220i8217m listening8221 8220the hardest part of my job is telling a player that it8217s time to quit you8217ve played all your life it8217s all you know all you dream about no one is ever ready to quit but rick ole buddy it8217s time to call it quits there are no options8221 8220i8217m twentyeight years old arnie8221 rick said with his eyes open very sad eyes 8220what do you suggest i do8221 8220a lot of guys go into coaching and real estate you were smartyou got your degree8221 8220my degree is in phys ed arnie that means i can get a job teaching volleyball to sixth graders for forty thousand a year i8217m not ready for that8221 arnie stood and walked around the end of the bed as if deep in thought 8220why don8217t you go home get some rest and think about it8221 8220home where is home i8217ve lived in so many different places8221 8220home is iowa rick they still love you there8221 and they really love you in denver arnie thought but wisely kept it to himself the idea of being seen on the streets of davenport iowa terrified rick and he let out a soft groan the town was probably humiliated by the play of its native son ouch he thought of his poor parents and closed his eyes arnie glanced at his watch then for some reason finally noticed that there were no getwell cards or flowers in the room the nurses told him that no friends had stopped by no family no teammates no one even remotely connected to the cleveland browns 8220i gotta run kid i8217ll drop by tomorrow8221 walking out he nonchalantly tossed the newspaper on rick8217s bed as soon as the door closed behind him rick grabbed it and soon wished he had not the police estimated a crowd of fifty had staged a rowdy demonstration outside the hospital things got ugly when a tv news crew showed up and began filming a window was smashed and a few of the drunker fans stormed the er checkin supposedly looking for rick dockery eight were arrested a large photo8211front page beneath the fold8211captured the crowd before the arrests two crude signs could be read clearly 8220pull the plug now8221 and 8220legalize euthanasia8221 it got worse the post had a notorious sportswriter named charley cray a nasty hack whose specialty was attack journalism just clever enough to be credible cray was widely read because he delighted in the missteps and foibles of professional athletes who earned millions yet were not perfect he was an expert on everything and never missed a chance for a cheap shot his tuesday column8211frontpage sports8211began with the headline 8220could dockery top alltime goat list8221 knowing cray there was no doubt rick dockery would top the list the column well researched and savagely written was structured around cray8217s opinions about the greatest individual chokes screwups and collapses in the history of sports there was bill buckner8217s booted ground ball in the 821786 world series jackie smith8217s dropped td pass in super bowl xiii and so on but as cray screamed at his readers those were only single plays mr dockery on the other hand managed three8211count them8211three horrible passes in only eleven minutes clearly therefore rick dockery is the unquestioned greatest goat in the history of professional sports the verdict was undisputed and cray challenged anyone to argue with him rick flung the newspaper against the wall and called for another pill in the darkness alone with the door closed he waited for the drug to work its magic to knock him out clean then hopefully to take him away forever he slipped lower in the bed pulled the sheet over his head and began crying chapter 2 it was snowing and arnie was tired of cleveland he was at the airport waiting for a ight to las vegas his home and against his better judgment he made a call to a lesser vice president of the arizona cardinals at the moment and not including rick dockery arnie had seven players in the nfl and four in canada he was if he could be forced to admit it a midlist agent who of course had bigger ambitions making phone calls for rick dockery was not going to help his credibility rick was arguably the mosttalkedabout player in the country at that dismal moment but it wasn8217t the kind of buzz that arnie needed the vice president was polite but brief and couldn8217t wait to get off the phone arnie went to a bar got a drink and managed to nd a seat far away from any television since the only story still raging in cleveland was the three interceptions by a quarterback no one even knew was on the team the browns had rolled through the season with a sputtering offense but a bruising defense one that shattered records for yielding so few yards and points they lost only once and with each win a city starved for a super bowl became more and more enthralled with their old lovable losers suddenly in one quick season the browns were the slayers had they won the previous sunday their super bowl opponent would be the minnesota vikings a team they shut out and routed back in november the entire city could taste the sweetness of a championship it all vanished in eleven horrifying minutes arnie ordered a second drink two salesmen at the next table were getting drunk and relishing the browns8217 collapse they were from detroit the hottest story of the day had been the ring of the browns8217 general manager clyde wacker a man who had been hailed as a genius as recently as the preceding saturday but was now the perfect scapegoat someone had to be red and not just rick dockery when it was nally determined that wacker had signed dockery off waivers back in october the owner red him the execution was publicbig press conference lots of frowns and promises to run a tighter ship et cetera the browns would be back arnie met rick during his senior year at iowa at the end of a season that had begun with much promise but was fading into a thirdtier bowl game rick started at quarterback his last two seasons and he seemed well suited for a dropback openstyle offense so rare in the big ten at times he was brilliantreading defenses coolly checking off at the line ring the ball with incredible velocity his arm was amazing undoubtedly the best in the upcoming draft he could throw long and hard with a lightningquick release but he was too erratic to be trusted and when buffalo picked him in the last round it should have been a clear sign that he needed to pursue a master8217s degree or a stockbroker8217s license instead he went to toronto for two miserable seasons then began bouncing around the nfl with a great arm rick was just barely good enough to make a roster every team needs a thirdstring quarterback in tryouts and there had been many he8217d often dazzled coaches with his arm arnie watched one day in kansas city when rick threw a football eighty yards then a few minutes later clocked a bullet at ninety miles an hour but arnie knew what most coaches now strongly suspected rick for a football player was afraid of contact not the incidental contact not the quick and harmless tackle of a scrambling quarterback rick with good reason feared the rushing tackles and the blitzing linebackers there is a moment or two in every game when a quarterback has a receiver open a split second to throw the ball and a massive roaring lineman charging the pocket unblocked the quarterback has a choice he can grit his teeth sacrice his body put his team rst throw the damned ball make the play and get crushed or he can tuck it and run and pray he lives for another play rick as long as arnie had watched him play had never not once put the team rst at the rst hint of a sack rick inched and ran frantically for the sideline and with a propensity for concussions arnie really couldn8217t blame him he called a nephew of the owner of the rams who answered the phone with an icy 8220i hope this is not about dockery8221 8220well yes it is8221 arnie managed to say 8220the answer is hell no8221 since sunday arnie had spoken with about half of the nfl teams the response from the rams was pretty typical rick had no idea how completely his sad little career had been terminated watching a monitor on the wall arnie saw his ight get delayed one more call he vowed one more effort to nd rick a job and then he would move on to his other players the clients were from portland and though his last name was webb and she was as pale as a swede they both claimed italian blood and were keen to see the old country where it all began each spoke about six words of the language and spoke them badly sam suspected they had picked up a travel book at the airport and memorized a few of the basics over the atlantic on their previous trip to italy their driverguide had been a native with 8220dreadful8221 english and so they had insisted on an american this time around a good yank who could arrange meals and nd tickets after two days together sam was ready to ship them back to portland sam was neither a driver nor a guide he was however very much an american and since his primary job paid little he moonlighted occasionally when his countrymen passed through and needed someone to hold their hands he waited outside in the car while they had a very long dinner at lazzaro8217s an old trattoria in the center of the city it was cold and snowing lightly and as he sipped strong coffee his thoughts returned to his roster as they always did his cell phone startled him the call was from the united states he said hello 8220sam russo please8221 came a crisp greeting 8220this is sam8221 8220coach russo8221 8220yes that8217s me8221 the caller identied himself as arnie something or other said he was an agent of some sort and claimed to have been a manager on the 1988 bucknell football team a few years after sam played there since they both went to bucknell they quickly found common ground and after a few minutes of doyouknowsoandso they were friendly for sam it was nice to chat with someone from his old school albeit a total stranger and it was rare that he got calls from agents arnie nally got to the point 8220sure i watched the playoffs8221 sam said 8220well i represent rick dockery and well the browns let him go8221 arnie said no surprise there sam thought but kept listening 8220and he8217s looking around considering his options i heard the rumor that you need a quarterback8221 sam almost dropped the phone a real nfl quarterback playing in parma 8220it8217s not a rumor8221 he said 8220my quarterback quit last week and took a coaching job somewhere in upstate new york we8217d love to have dockery is he okay physically i mean8221 8220sure just bruised a little but he8217s ready to go8221 8220and he wants to play in italy8221 8220maybe we haven8217t discussed it yet you know he8217s still in the hospital but we8217re looking at all the possibilities frankly he needs a change of scenery8221 8220do you know the game over here8221 sam asked nervously 8220it8217s good football but it8217s a far cry from the nfl and the big ten i mean these guys are not professionals in the true sense of the word8221 8220what level8221 8220i don8217t know tough to say ever hear of a school called washington and lee down in virginia a nice school good football division iii8221 8220sure8221 8220they came over last year during spring break and we scrimmaged them a couple of times pretty even matchup8221 8220division iii huh8221 arnie said his voice losing some steam but then rick needed a softer game another concussion and he might indeed suffer the brain damage so often joked about truthfully arnie didn8217t care just another phone call or two and rick dockery was history 8220look arnie8221 sam began earnestly time for the truth 8220it8217s a club sport over here or maybe a notch above that each team in the series a gets three american players and they usually get meal money maybe some rent the quarterbacks are typically american and they get a small salary the rest of the roster is a bunch of tough italians who play because they love football if they8217re lucky and the owner is in a good mood they might get pizza and beer after the game we play an eightgame schedule with playoffs then a chance for the italian super bowl our eld is old but nice well maintained seats about three thousand and for a big game we might ll it we have corporate sponsors cool uniforms but no tv contract and no real money to speak of we8217re smack in the middle of the world of soccer so our football has more of a cult following8221 8220how did you get there8221 8220i love italy my grandparents emigrated from this region settled in baltimore where i grew up but i have lots of cousins around here my wife is italian and so on it8217s a delightful place to live can8217t make any money coaching american football but we8217re having fun8221 8220so the coaches get paid8221 8220yes you could say that8221 8220any other nfl rejects8221 8220occasionally one passes through some lost soul still dreaming of a super bowl ring but the americans are usually small college players who love the game and have a sense of adventure8221 8220how much can you pay my man8221 8220let me check with the owner8221 8220do that and i8217ll check with my client8221 they signed off after another bucknell story and sam returned to his coffee an nfl quarterback playing football in italy it was hard to imagine though not without precedent the bologna warriors were in the italian super bowl two years earlier with a fortyyearold quarterback who8217d once played briey for oakland he quit after two seasons and went to canada sam turned the car heater down a notch and replayed the nal minutes of the brownsbroncos game never in his memory had he watched one player so completely engineer a defeat and lose a game that was so clearly won he himself had almost cheered when dockery was carried off the eld nevertheless the idea of coaching him in parma was intriguing
