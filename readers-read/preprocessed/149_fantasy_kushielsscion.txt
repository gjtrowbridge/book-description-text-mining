 one we were attending a country fair when the news came for a while a long while after our final return to terre d8217ange life was blissfully uneventful having had enough adventures to last me a lifetime i was grateful for it whether in the city or at montregraveve i tended to my studies immersed in the daily business of living and content to let the affairs of the world pass me by untouched phegravedre and joscelin did all they could to allow this respite to endure sensing there was healing in it for me there was too as the slow months passed and turned into years i felt things knotted tight inside me ease my nightmares grew less and less frequent and the times of happiness longer still even phegravedre and joscelin couldn8217t protect me forever it was my third summer in montregraveve i had turned fourteen in the spring though i looked younger being slow to get my full growth the queen8217s chirurgeon claimed it was due to the shock of enslavement and what had befallen me in darsanga and mayhap it was so i only know that i chafed at it my parents were both tall or so i am told i cannot say having never known my father if it8217s true it is the only gift of theirs i8217d ever wished for the fair was held in an open field on the outskirts of the village alongside the river it was a small gathering montregraveve was not a large estate and the village it bordered8212which was also called montregraveve8212was modest in size but it was a fair and i was young enough to be excited at the prospect of it we made for a merry entourage as we rode forth from the estate phegravedre joscelin and i accompanied by her chevalier tiphilippe his companion hugues and a few other menatarms all of them clad in the forestgreen livery of house montregraveve the friote clan was already there tending to our wooltrading interests the bulk of our wool would be shipped elsewhere for sale but there were always small landowners looking to buy there were other goods available for purchase or trade too fabrics and yarns livestock produce spices and other uninteresting items of greater interest at least to me were the crafters8217 booths which displayed a fascinating array8212leather goods arms and bits of armor jewelry mirrors mysterious vials of unguents musical instruments and intricately carved toys not all of them were meant for children either best of all there were tsingani with horses for sale not many8212the pick of the lot sold at the great horse fairs in the spring8212but a few we spotted their brightly painted wagons from the road and i saw phegravedre smile at the sight there was a time when the tsingani wouldn8217t have been welcome at a small country fair but a lot has changed since those days in montregraveve they were always welcome there were a few goodnatured cheers and shouts of greeting as we arrived which phegravedre acknowledged with a laughing salute she was always gracious that way and wellloved because of it we tethered our mounts at the picket line and joscelin gave a few coins to the village lads who hung about to attend them tiphilippe and the others remained mounted 8220i8217ll take hugues and colin and ride a quick circuit8221 he said to joscelin who gave a brief nod in reply 8220marcel and the others will cast an eye over the fair proper8221 i hated hearing that sort of thing it cast a pall over the day8217s brightness knowing it was because of me queen ysandre was insistent that my security was paramount and a fair brought strangers into the area they were only being cautious but still i hated it joscelin eyed me noting my expression 8220take heart8221 he said wryly 8220when you come of age you8217ll be free to take all the risks you like8221 8220four years8221 i protested 8220it8217s forever8221 a corner of his mouth twitched 8220you think so8221 he tousled my hair lightly i hated when almost anyone else did it8212i didn8217t like people touching me8212but my heart always gave a secret leap of happiness when phegravedre or joscelin did 8220it won8217t seem it i promise8221 he glanced at phegravedre then and something passed between them a shared and private understanding there are those who laugh at their union although not many not now after all they have endured together it8217s true though 8217tis an unlikely pairing kushiel8217s chosen and a servant of naamah in love with a cassiline warriorpriest phegravedre was a courtesan sworn to the service of blessed elua8217s companion naamah who gave herself to the king of persis to win elua8217s freedom and who lay down in the stews of bhodistan with strangers that he might eat it is a sacred calling in terre d8217ange though it is not one practiced by many peers of the realm but phegravedre was a servant of naamah long before she inherited delaunay8217s title and estate and although she has not practiced it since darsanga she has never renounced naamah8217s service and joscelin8212joscelin was a cassiline brother when they met although he left the brotherhood for her sake from the age of ten he was trained to be a warriorpriest sworn to celibacy alone among the companions cassiel claimed no territory in terre d8217ange and begot no offspring but remained ever at blessed elua8217s side that is the vow of the cassiline brotherhood to protect and serve the cassilines are very good at what they do but joscelin i think is better 8220what will you love8221 he asked phegravedre indicating the fair with the sweep of an arm his steel vambraces glinted in the sun 8220pleasure or the duties of the manor the tsingani or the friotes8221 8220ah well8221 she cocked her head 8220we could glance at the fabric stalls on the way to either one if there8217s aught of interest it won8217t last long8221 i groaned inside i hated looking at fabric although i made no audible sound phegravedre8217s gaze settled on me dark and unnerving her eyes were beautiful deep and lustrous as forest pools with a mote of scarlet floating on the left iris vivid as a rose petal and she was capable of a look that saw right through one there were reasons for it 8220all right8221 she smiled and beckoned to another of the menatarms 8220gilot will you accompany imriel to8212to the tsingani horsefields is it8221 8220yes please8221 i couldn8217t help the grin that stretched my face gilot swept an extravagant bow 8220lady with a will8221 he was my favorite retainer after tiphilippe and hugues who were almost family he was the youngest8212only eighteen the age of majority i coveted but he was good with a sword and quickthinking which were qualities joscelin looked for in hiring retainers i liked him because he treated me as an equal not a responsibility together we plunged into the fair and began forging a path toward the horsefields 8220they8217ve got one of those spotted horses from aragonia did you see8221 gilot asked 8220i spied it from the road i wouldn8217t mind having one8221 i made a noise of agreement 8220whipsmart and smoothgaited they say8221 he shrugged 8220next year mayhap if i save my coin8221 a stand of leather goods caught his eye 8220ah hold a moment will you imri my swordbelt8217s worn near enough to snap near the buckle it was my brother8217s anyway i ought to buy new8221 i loitered at gilot8217s side while he perused the goods available and the leathermerchant made a great show of exclaiming over my own belt it was a man8217s belt though it held only a boy8217s dagger 8220what have you there little man8221 he asked in a jovial condescending tone 8220boarhide8221 8220no8221 i smiled coolly at him 8220rhinoceros8221 he blinked perplexed gilot gave a sidelong glance nudging me with his elbow the belt had been a gift from ras lijasu a prince of jebebarkal gilot knew the story behind it the merchant blinked a few more times 8220a rhinoceros is it good for you little man8221 8220imriel8221 i turned recognizing the voice at an adjacent stall katherine friote beckoned imperiously shoving up the sleeve of her gown 8220come here and smell this8221 she said i went obedient katherine was in the middle of the friote clan a year and some months my elder in the past year she had begun to change in a fascinating manner the skinny bossy girl i had met two summers ago had become a young woman a head taller than me she thrust her wrist beneath my nose 8220what do you think8221 she asked i swallowed hard she had rubbed a dab of perfumed ointment on her skin and the scent was strong and cloying like overblown lilies beneath it faint and elusive i could smell her own scent like a sunwarmed meadow 8220i think you smell better without it8221 i said honestly the perfumeseller made a disgusted sound i thought katherine would be annoyed with me but instead she wore a look of amusement she bobbed a teasing curtsy in my direction 8220why thank you prince imriel8221 8220you8217re welcome8221 my face felt unaccountably warm 8220prince is it8221 the perfumeseller turned his head and spat on the ground obviously he was a stranger to montregraveve 8220prince of sheepdung i8217ll warrant8221 at that moment gilot appeared at my side wearing a swordbelt so new that it creaked over his montregravevan livery 8220well met demoiselle friote8221 he said cheerfully 8220would you care to accompany us to the tsingani camp his highness has a fancy to see the spotted horse and the comtesse has given us her blessing8221 now it was katherine who blushed at gilot8217s chivalrous attention while the perfumeseller opened and closed his mouth several times fishlike then squinted hard at me i muttered somewhat under my breath about spotted horses which all of them ignored 8220shall we8221 gilot asked katherine extending his arm and smiling at her he had a lively handsome face and brown eyes quick to sparkle with mirth still it irked me to see katherine dote on him we made our way through the stalls pausing for gilot to purchase a sweet of candied violets for katherine through the crowd i caught a glimpse of phegravedre at a clothseller8217s stall examining bolts of fabric the merchant was fawning over her at her side joscelin observed the process with an expression of long tolerance he stood in the cassiline atease position arms crossed hands resting lightly on the hilts of his twin daggers i mulled over my irritation as we continued walking kicking at clumps of footchurned grass 8220i wish you wouldn8217t say such things8221 i said at length 8220not here8221 8220what things8221 gilot gave me a perplexed look 8220prince8221 i said 8220highness8221 8220well but you are8221 he scratched his head 8220look imri i know8212i mean i understand a bit but you are who you are and there8217s no changing it anyway there8217s no call to let some tawdry peddler insult you i8217m not one to let it pass unnoted8221 i shrugged 8220i8217ve heard worse8221 8220you didn8217t mind so much when i said it8221 katherine glanced at me under her lashes the sun brought out golden streaks in her glossy brown hair and sparkled on tiny crumbs of sugar clinging to her lips i looked away 8220please forget i spoke of it8221 these new feelings katherine evoked shouldn8217t have disturbed me in terre d8217ange the arts of love came to us easily and young or so it should be i was different it wasn8217t that i was immune to the promptings of desire8212in the past several months i had grown uncomfortably aware of desire stirring in my flesh but in the zenana of darsanga death and desire were inextricably linked i couldn8217t think about one without the shadow of the other hanging over it so at a time when boys my age were conducting fumbling experiments with one another and begging kisses from girls i kept myself aloof afraid and untouchable gilot sighed 8220come on let8217s go8221 i forgot my grievances in the tsingani camp there were two kumpanias present with three wagons between them the wagons were drawn in a circle with their horses tethered at the rear at the front of the wagons women tended cooking fires where kettles of stew and pottage simmered the unwed women wore their hair uncovered and loose and made long eyes at the tsingani men and all of them wore galb displaying their wealth necklaces and earrings strung with gold coins a few of the men were engaged in haggling with potential buyers but most of them idled in the center of the circle bursts of music issued forth as one or another began to play8212fiddle or timbales accompanied by rhythmic clapping and snatches of song it would be a good life i think to be one of the travellers or at least it would be for a man it was harder for tsingani women who must abide by a stringent code of behavior lest they lose their virtue their laxta they called it if that happened they were declared anathema it is better now than it once was much of that is due to hyacinthe who is the master of the straits and wields a power beyond the mortal ken i know for i have seen it seen wind and wave answer to his command he was one of them once8212a halfbreed tsingano born to a woman who lost her virtue through no fault of her own in the end they would have had him as their king but he refused it still he has urged change upon them and many of the tsingani have eased the strictures they impose on their women hyacinthe has reason to be concerned with the lot of women since it is to phegravedre that he owes his freedom i shivered in the warm sunlight remembering the day she spoke the name of god and broke the curse that bound him to an immortality of dwindling age on that lonely island there are some memories so profound they cannot be conveyed in words some of them for a mercy are good ones gilot let out a low whistle breaking my reverie 8220look at him will you what a beauty8221 there was an admiring crowd around the spotted horse staked on the outskirts of the circle i had to own the horse was a beauty8212a powerfully arched neck strong straight legs a smooth back his coat was a deep redbay speckled with white as though in the middle of summer he stood amidst a snowstorm he basked in the adulation of the crowd tossing his head and stamping his forefeet almost as though to beat time with the nearby timbales 8220imriel katherine8221 charles friote detached himself from the throng of admirers and waved us over he was my age though to my chagrin he too had grown in the past year overtaking me by a head 8220hello gilot8221 charles added belatedly then dropped his voice to a whisper 8220he8217s not for sale the tsingani say but maybe for lady phegravedre 8221 i was opening my mouth to reply when the tsingano holding the spotted horse8217s head beckoned to me calling out 8220hey rinkeni chavo come meet the salmon8221 it was the spotted horse8217s name i guessed while charles squirmed with envy behind me i moved forward the tsingano who had beckoned me grinned his teeth very white against his brown skin 8220here chavo 8221 he said pressing something into my palm 8220give him a treat8221 it was a bit of dried apple the end of last autumn8217s stores i held my hand out flat the salmon eyed me lordly and considering then bent his head to accept the tidbit his lips velvety against my palm i began to think about what a glory it would be to ride him8212to own him8212and wondered if perhaps the tsingani might sell him to phegravedre after all i could repay her for him there were monies that were mine to spend held in trust for me the proceeds of estates i had never seen nor cared to 8220a gadjo pearl with black hair and eyes like the deep sea8221 the tsingano horsetrader murmured i jerked back startling the horse 8220peace chavo 8221 the tsingano raised one hand palm outward his dark eyes were calm and amused 8220we remember that is all does it trouble you8221 it was the second question of the day i had no chance to answer on the far side of the field familiar shouts arose8212the battlecall of house montregraveve giving an alarm i turned to see a single rider departing from the road to race hellforleather toward the fair whatever his intentions the sight didn8217t bode well i was abruptly aware that i had only gilot for protection tiphilippe and his men were on a course to intercept the rider but they were too far away the rider would reach us first gilot swore and drew his sword in three swift steps he reached me grabbing my arm and yanking me behind him katherine and charles were roundeyed with fearful awe the spotted stallion reared against his tether trumpeting while his tsingano owner sought to soothe him in the midst of the fair pandemonium broke loose a handful of villagers sought to rally to our aid seizing weapons from the armssellers8217 stalls protesting merchants blocked their way grabbing at their purloined goods here and there was a struggling knot where one of montregraveve8217s retainers sought to shove a path through the throng i watched the rider loom nearer and drew my dagger flipping it to hold it by its point at fifteen paces or less my aim was good in front of me gilot maintained a defensive stance legs planted sword tight in his fist a muscle in his jaw trembled katherine8217s fingers dug into my left forearm i pried them loose shoving her toward charles 8220take care of her8221 i said the words coming harshly he nodded his face pale brown hair flopping over his brow a single voice raised called my name 8220imriel8221 i raised mine in reply and though it cracked it carried 8220joscelin here 8221 there bursting free of the crowd he came at a dead run crossing the horsefields to the tsingani camp passing gilot the rider thundered toward us tiphilippe and the others following hard behind a few seconds too late not joscelin his sword sang as he reached over his shoulder and drew it a high keening note tradition holds that cassiline brothers draw their swords only to kill when it came to my defense joscelin observed no such niceties 8220stand down or die8221 he called to the rider angling his sword across his body in a twohanded grip the rider drew rein hard turning his lathered hardridden mount froth flew from its bit a hafted pennant now visible fluttered from a hilt mounted on the pommel of his saddle8212a square of rich blue with a diagonal bar of silver 8220queen8217s courier8221 he shouted 8220in the name of queen ysandre hold your hand8221 joscelin did not shift his voice remaining taut 8220stand down man8221 in that moment it seemed everyone else converged tiphilippe hugues and colin arrived in a thunderous flurry of hoofbeats blocking the rider8217s retreat tsingani armed with light hunting bows emerged from the circle of wagons villagers armed with sticks cudgels and appropriated swords ran into the field and phegravedre she stepped lightly past me touching my shoulder briefly in passing at her appearance everyone grew quiet she wore a gown of vibrant blue the color of the summer sky the color of joscelin8217s eyes it was trimmed with gold embroidery a handspan deep and a caul of gold mesh bound her dark shining hair 8220queen8217s courier8221 she asked frowning slightly joscelin adjusted his stance angling his sword to protect her 8220what news is so urgent8221 the rider dropped his reins his mount lowered its head blowing hard its nostrils flaring 8220my lady phegravedre noacute delaunay de montregraveve8221 8220yes8221 she regarded him calmly he raised his hands showing them to be empty 8220i bear an urgent dispatch from the queen8221 he said reaching slowly into a pouch slung over the crupper of his saddle he drew forth a sealed missive 8220here8221 joscelin took it from his grasp examined it then handed it to phegravedre it was a slim envelope sealed with the swan insignia of house courcel she cracked the wax seal and read the single sheet of parchment within i watched the frown lines reemerge beween her graceful brows 8220the queen requires our presence in the city of elua8221 she said 8220there is a situation8221 8220what is it8221 joscelin asked brusquely phegravedre handed him the missive but it was on me that her gaze settled pitying and grave 8220it is melisande8221 she said gently 8220it seems she has vanished8221
