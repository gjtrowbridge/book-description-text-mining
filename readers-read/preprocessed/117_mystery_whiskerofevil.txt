barry monteith was still breathing when harry found him his throat had been ripped out tee tucker a corgi racing ahead of mary minor haristeen as well as the two cats mrs murphy and pewter found him first barry was on his back eyes open gasping and gurgling life ebbing with each spasm he did not recognize tucker nor harry when they reached him barry barry harry tried to comfort him hoping he could hear her it will be all right she said knowing perfectly well he was dying the tiger cat mrs murphy watched the blood jet upward jugular fat gray pewter succinctly commented gently harry took the young mans hand and prayed dear lord receive into thy bosom the soul of barry monteith a good man tears welled in her eyes barry jerked then his suffering ended death often so shocking to city dwellers was part of life here in the country a hawk would swoop down to carry away the chick while the biddy screamed useless defiance a bull would break his hip and need to be put down and one day an old farmer would slowly walk to his tractor only to discover he couldnt climb into the seat the angel of death placed his hand on the stooping shoulder it appeared the angel had offered little peaceful deliverance to barry monteith thirtyfour fit handsome with brown curly hair and funloving barry had started his own business breeding thoroughbreds a year ago with a business partner sugar thierry sweet jesus harry wiped away the tears that saturday morning crisp clear and beautiful had held the alluring promise of a perfect may 29 the promise just curdled harry had finished her earlymorning chores and despite a list of projects decided to take a walk for an hour she followed potlicker creek to see if the beavers had built any new dams barry was sprawled at the creeks edge on a dirt road two miles from her farm that wound up over the mountains into adjoining augusta county it edged the vast land holdings of tally urquhart who well into her nineties and spry loathed traffic three cars constituted traffic in her mind the only time the road saw much use was during deerhunting season in the fall tucker mrs murphy and pewter stay im going to run to tallys and phone the sheriff if harry hit a steady lope crossed the fields and one set of woods she figured she could reach the phone in tallys stable within fifteen minutes though the pitch and roll of the land including one steep ravine would cost time as she left her animals they inspected barry what could rip his throat like that a bear swipe pewters pupils widened perhaps mrs murphy noncommittal sniffed the gaping wound as did tucker the cat curled her upper lip to waft more scent into her nostrils the dog whose nose was much longer and nostrils larger simply inhaled i dont smell bear tucker declared thats an overpowering scent and on a morning like this it would stick pewter who cherished luxury and beauty found that barrys corpse disturbed her equilibrium lets be grateful we found him today and not three days from now stop jabbering pewter and look around will you look for tracks grumbling the gray cat daintily stepped down the dirt road you mean like car tracks yes or animal tracks mrs murphy directed then returned her attention to tucker even though coyote scent isnt as strong as bear wed still smell a whiff bobcat i dont smell anything like that or dog there are wild dogs and wild pigs back in the mountains the humans dont even realize theyre there tucker cocked her perfectly shaped head no dirt around the wound no saliva either i dont see anything not even a birdie foot pewter irritated called out from a hundred yards down the road well go across the creek then and look over there mrs murphys patience wore thin and get my paws wet pewters voice rose its a ford hop from rock to rock go on pewt stop being a chicken angrily pewter puffed up tearing past them to launch herself over the ford she almost made it but a splash indicated shed gotten her hind paws wet if circumstances had been different mrs murphy and tucker would have laughed instead they returned to barry i cant identify the animal that tore him up the tiger shook her head well the wound is jagged but clean like i said no dirt tucker studied the folds of flesh laid back he was killed lying down the cat sagely noted if he was standing up dont you think blood would be everywhere not necessarily the dog replied thinking how strong heartbeats sent blood straight out from the jugular tucker was puzzled by the odd calmness of the scene pewter have you found anything on that side deer tracks big deer tracks keep looking mrs murphy requested i hate it when youre bossy nonetheless pewter moved down the dirt road heading west barry was such a nice man tucker mournfully looked at the squarejawed face wideopen eyes staring at heaven mrs murphy circled the body tucker im climbing up that sycamore if i look down maybe ill see something her claws razor sharp dug into the thin surface of the tree strips of darker outer bark peeling exposing the whitish underbark the odor of fresh water of the tufted titmouse above her all informed her she scanned around for broken limbs bent bushes anything indicating barryother humans or large animalshad traveled to this spot avoiding the dirt road pewter big fat nothing the gray kitty noted that her hind paws were wet she was getting little clods of dirt stuck between her toes this bothered her more than barry did after all he was dead nothing she could do for him but the hardening brown earth between her toes that was discomfiting well come on back well wait for mom mrs murphy dropped her hind legs over the limb where she was sitting her hind paws reached for the trunk the claws dug in and she released her grip swinging her front paws to the trunk she backed down tucker touched noses with pewter who had recrossed the creek more successfully this time mrs murphy came up and sat beside them hope his face doesnt change colors while were waiting for the humans i hate that they get all mottled pewter wrinkled her nose i wouldnt worry tucker sighed in the distance they heard sirens bet they wont know what to make of this either tucker said its peculiar mrs murphy turned her head in the direction of the sirens weird and creepy pewter pronounced judgment as she picked at her hind toes and she was right 2 crozet was the last stop on the railroad before the locomotive disappeared into the first of the four tunnels claudius crozet had dug through the blue ridge mountains this feat accomplished before dynamite was considered one of the seven engineering wonders of the world in the midnineteenth century at the beginning of the twentyfirst century they were still wonders as two remained in use the other two were closed but not filled in on the other side of the blue ridge mountains reposed the fertile and long shenandoah valley running from winchester virginia by the west virginia line all the way to north carolina the allegheny mountains bordered the huge valley to the west but on the eastern slopes of the blue ridge mountains the land although not as fertile could be quite good in patches harrys tidy farm rested on one of those patches although lacking the thousands of acres of tally urquhart she owned four hundred acres give or take plus she had kept her tobacco allotments current allotments secured by her late father shortly after world war ii still like many a southerner and especially a virginian harry was land poor good land little cash deputy cynthia cooper drove down the long drive with harry in the front seat her animals in the back of the squad car stones crunching underneath her tires house or barn house did my barn chores want coffee or tea love coffee cooper stopped cut the motor as harry opened the doors for mrs murphy pewter and tucker the animals raced ahead ducking through the animal door on the side of the screened door and then through the second animal door in the kitchen door harry and cooper followed them tenthirty i hadnt paid attention to the time she ground coffee beans in the electric grinder as she put up water for tea harry loved the smell of coffee but couldnt drink it as it made her too jumpy theres corn bread in the fridge miranda made a mess of it yesterday miranda hogendobber a lady in her sixties worked with harry at the tiny crozet post office where harry was postmistress the light inside the refrigerator illuminated coopers badge she pulled out the corn bread and some sweet butter applesauce harry nodded church of the holy light last fall the applesauce had been cooked up to perfection by the ladies of the small church to which miranda belonged harry attended st lukes lutheran church where her friend the reverend herbert jones was the pastor she sat on the parish guild impressing other older members with her organizational skills here harry refilled the cats driedfood bowl then reached into a large stoneware cookie jar to give tucker a smoked pigs ear thank you the corgi solemnly took the tasty ear remaining in the kitchen to chew it because she didnt want to miss anything you okay why wouldnt i be its not every day you find a dead man dying he was dying when we reached him yeah im okay i feel terrible for him but im okay gurgling pewter added the vivid detail right cooper opened a drawer grabbed two blue and yellow linen napkins placing them by the plates a country person herself cooper understood that country people lived much closer to life and death than most urban or suburban people it was good of rick to allow you to take me home i could have walked rick shaw was sheriff of albemarle county an elected position and one growing ever more difficult as more wealthy people moved to this most beautiful place wealthy people tend to be very demanding he was understaffed underappreciated and underpaid but he loved law enforcement and did the best with what he had ricks more flexible than people realize cooper replied once hed inspected the corpse questioned you no reason to keep you another thing about rick he doesnt miss much she said i hope the autopsy will reveal something no sign of struggle no sign that he dragged himself there coopers blond eyebrows pointed upward as her mind turned over events i know and no scent tucker spoke with her mouth full so handsome cooper sighed as she sat down while harry served her a big mug of coffee then took a striped creamer from the fridge and poured some of the rich eggshellcolored devon cream into coopers coffee every now and then a girl has to treat herself to the best harry put the creamer on the checkered tablecloth as she sat down enemiesbarry cooper knew harry would know he used to run with a wild crowd but when he and sugar started the business over at st james farm he sobered up sex drugs and rock and roll cooper reached for more corn bread he was so goodlooking and easygoing that he got away with a lot course when his father wrapped his nissan truck around a tree and died that started to sober up barry he hasnt any family left when he started the breeding operation he really cleaned up his act i recall he left a trail of broken hearts cooper sipped her delicious coffee the last one was uh carmen gamble she was mad enough to kill him six months ago but not strong enough to bite his throat out cooper added for all we know a mad dog bit his throat maybe boy what a way to go cooper thoughtfully paused a moment if i came up on susan breathing her last id harry paused i think id never be the same susan tucker was harrys best friend married to a successful lawyer they had one son at cornell and a daughter in high school makes you wonder about war fiftyone thousand dead at gettysburg people get used to it or the siege of st petersburg leningrad you just get used to it i dont know if i could ever get used to the smell yeah thats worse than the sight for sure helps if you dont breathe through your nose certainly makes you understand why soldiers smokekills the odor a little bit and soothes your nerves harry noticed a flaming red cardinal swoop by the kitchen window heading for the large bird feeder hanging in the old tree by the kitchen thats another thing humans will drink take drugs anything to feel better if you knew how many little drug busts we do i mean they arent exactly selling kilos of marijuana but the law states its a crime and so i bust these guys i cant keep up with it and it doesnt work but it sure has made me think about why so many people do stuff cooper thats easy it feels good their body chemistry is a little different from yours and mine booze makes me sick but for someone else its heaventemporarily well im thinking about drugs and alcohol in a new way you and i know were going to die humans carry around all this anxiety that stems from that original anxiety the knowledge of death hence drugs and drink you dont see mrs murphy lapping up rum tastes awful but give me some catnip mrs murphys green eyes brightened i never thought about that coop youre a philosopher no just a cop she finished her third piece of corn bread im surprised you havent called susan or miranda or fair fair was harrys exhusband who remained a dear friend in fact she was thinking how much a part of her life he was and hopefully would always be thought id wait until you left is anything offlimits no we dont even know enough to hold back evidence cooper winked not that rick would ever do such a thing right harry smiled hows he doing i havent seen him for a while except for today hes been down at the courthouse engaged in the battle of the budget no wonder i havent seen him hey to change the subject have you heard anything about the new post office being built no more than you have the population increase even out here in crozet warrants a larger building
