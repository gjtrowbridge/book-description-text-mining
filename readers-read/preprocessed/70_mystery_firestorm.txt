nutcases youre one of the most brilliant men i know and i have a job for you here where you can keep an eye on me brad grinned as he leaned lazily back in the chair and stretched his legs out before him it wouldnt do you any good im a lost cause only because you want to be and its not good for you youre burning yourself out look at you youve lost weight since i saw you last a little ive had a rough four months then give it up and come to me and do what if i were anywhere close to you the media would eventually ferret out our connection besides you cant trust me id get mad and open my mouth at the wrong time and blow your political career his smile faded ive done a hell of a lot of harm to you in these last years but i wont do that id chance it ive been in the senate for twelve years and if my reputation can be damaged by just having you around then maybe its time i stepped down no brad paused and then tempered his tone look cam dont be an ass everythings going fine we dont need to change anything he stood up and glanced around the elegant booklined library that breathed wealth and solidity this isnt my world you cant squeeze me into your mold because you want me to share the good life he smiled besides what would charlotte say shed come around she just has some weird ideas about you brad looked at him inquiringly cam made a face she says you make her uneasy she thinks youre sinister she used that word i didnt think anyone could make your wife uneasy maybe im more intimidating than i thought she doesnt understand you like i said shell come around theres no reason to force her to make the effort things are fine as they are cam was silent a moment did it ever occur to you that im being selfish ive missed you brad he meant it cam was always honest oh shit dont do this to me brad shook his head ive missed you too maybe we can arrange to get together more often thats not good enough ive been looking at my life since that horror on september eleventh and when it all comes down to the bottom line its friends and family that count i wont let you walk away again cam charlotte devers was standing in the doorway sleek and sophisticated in a black gown i didnt want to disturb you but were going to be late for the embassy dinner she smiled at brad you and cam can talk when we get back he shook his head im just leaving anyway no youre not cameron said firmly ill only be gone a few hours and i want you here when i get back perhaps tomorrow charlotte suggested ive had a room prepared for you brad as usual charlotte was trying to control the situation with gentle skill brad thought she wanted cam to leave and she didnt want him to talk to brad until she could find a discreet way to ease brad out on his ass well he couldnt blame her she valued cams career more than his brother did and was always on guard to protect it im not going anywhere until you make me a promise cam stared brad in the eye will you be here brad glanced at the faint frown between charlottes eyes and then smiled slyly you couldnt budge me great cam slapped him on the shoulder before turning away come on charlotte lets get this thing over with he strode out of the library charlotte hesitated and started to speak dont say it brad murmured were on the same side he added if you dont piss me off he followed cam into the foyer and watched george the butler help him into his coat very impressive i havent worn a tux in fifteen years does that tell you anything it tells me youre damn lucky cam took charlottes arm and helped her down the front steps toward the waiting limo make yourself at home but dont go to bed you made me a promise does that mean i cant get drunk on your excellent brandy no i want you stone cold sober he smiled at him over his shoulder i have an ace in the hole and need to tell you about a job that may intrigue you enough to lure you here its right up your alley weird and sinister he asked straightfaced im going to get my way brad now dont nag him cam charlotte said gently brad knows what he wants to do but not whats best for him brad watched them get into the limousine hed planned on going back inside but he couldnt resist standing here and letting charlotte see him so at home on her front step dressed in tennis shoes worn jeans and an old sweatshirt he couldnt have been more of a blot on her fine landscape his enjoyment was totally immature but he didnt give a damn he usually didnt mind charlottes attempts at manipulating cam she was a good wife to him and that was all that was important to brad tonight she was trying to manipulate brad as well and that he couldnt tolerate would you like me to serve you coffee in the library sir george asked from behind him why not he grinned at him over his shoulder since ive been forbidden the comfort of whoosh dear god georges eyes were wide with shock brads head jerked around and followed his gaze to the limo christ in heaven the interior of the limousine was a sheet of fire he could see cam and charlotte writhing like burning scarecrows in the flames son of a bitch he flew down the steps toward the car atlanta georgia six months later kerry carefully touched the blackened timber lying across the bathroom sink it was still slightly warm from the fire that had destroyed the restaurant two days ago that wasnt unusual sometimes hidden pockets of embers remained burning for days sam her lab whined and pushed nearer to kerry he was easily bored and theyd been here at the burnedout ruins for over an hour be quiet she reached beneath the timber and dug well be out of here soon there it was with an effort she pushed the timber aside find anything detective perry asked from behind her bad wiring no gasoline kerry said the fire originated here in the bathroom and spread throughout the restaurant she nodded at the burned and blackened device shed found beneath the timber and a timing device to set it off dumb the police detective shook his head i thought chin li was brighter than that if he wanted to collect the insurance why didnt he set the fire in the kitchen hed have had a better shot at convincing everyone the fire was accidental youre sure sams sure she reached out and touched the dogs silky black head and i usually go along with him hes not often wrong yeah so ive heard perry awkwardly patted the dogs nose i dont understand how these arson dogs do it but it makes my job a hell of a lot easier i guess ill go talk to chin li again too bad he seemed like a nice little guy and not stupid kerry got to her feet and dusted the soot off her palms then maybe someone else set the fire someone who didnt have access to the kitchen insurance isnt always the right answer just the easy one his eyes narrowed on her face are you saying that im looking for an out she grinned i wouldnt presume im just saying that you should ask chin li if he had any enemies perhaps rivals in business orthis is a highcrime areaare there any protection rackets operating that might have decided to make him an example possibly he said slowly there are a couple teenage gangs that are stepping up to the plate and trying to control the area would they know how to set timing devices everyone who has internet has access to practically any information want to make an atomic bomb go on the internet shed done all she could time to step out of the picture before he got belligerent well well know more once we finish the investigation sam and i are just the advance team she smiled and were finished for now have a nice day detective wait he said awkwardly this is a lousy neighborhood if youll wait until i finish with chin li ill give you an escort back to your office thats nice of you but im not going back downtown its my day off and im going to visit a couple friends at the firehouse on morningside if its your day off why are you here they needed sams nose then ill drive you and sams nose to this firehouse he frowned why do they let you go to neighborhoods like this alone anyway youre just a little bit of a thing she felt a prickle of resentment that she quickly quenched she was average height but she knew her slender frame and delicate bones made her appear smaller he was a nice guy and she was used to having her fragile appearance equated with helplessness she gave him the answer he was most likely to accept i have sam to protect me he gave the lab a skeptical glance he may have a great nose but he doesnt look very threatening to me its because he has those crossed eyes hes really a great guard dog she waved and carefully picked her way through the rubble toward the door sam lunged eagerly forward almost pulling her from her feet idiot she grumbled do you want to break both our necks id think youd learn sam burst out into the street and started barking oh god all she needed was to attract attention in this slum neighborhood she hurriedly pulled the dog toward her 4runner she knew as well as the detective that sam looked about as dangerous as a cuddly koala why didnt i get a big german shepherd at that pound because shed looked at him in that cage and hadnt been able to resist lets go sam and for petes sake shut up full house kerry grinned as she pulled in the pot in the middle of the table that should just about take care of my rent for the month another hand no way charlie grimaced as he pushed back his chair im cleaned out im going to go peel the onions for dinner he cast a sly look over his shoulder beef stroganoff remember firehouse number ten specialty of the house im drooling may i stay hell no go back to your snooty office downtown and eat in that fancy cafeteria cruel she looked at jimmy swartz and paul corbin another hand guys not me jimmy stood up ive got to have enough money to make sure my wife lets me in the house when my shift is over come on paul lets play a game of pool he gave kerry a stern glance and no you cant play with us this is for real firemen not desk jockeys like you youre just scared ill beat you she got up and followed charlie to the kitchen youre trying to torture me you know i love your stroganoff come on let me stay maybe charlie handed her a bag of onions and a knife if you do the onions she beamed ill chop she sat down on a stool at the counter hows your wife charlie putting up with me he grinned thats all you can ask after twentyfive years he put dredged pieces of beef in the hot pan edna told me to give you hell about asking her to take care of sam while you were on vacation she and the kids are in love with the mutt though how she can like a dumb dog like that lab of yours is beyond me everyone loves sam not every dog is an einstein she picked up another onion and you like him too hes very lovable but everyone thinks hes einstein charlie shook his head in amazement as he glanced at sam snoozing in the corner of the kitchen how he can be so smart on a job in the field and so dumb in every other aspect of life boggles the mind he has a good nose he has a good heart you cant expect him to have a good brain too all i can say is that its good youre the other half of this arson investigating team or sam would be chasing butterflies in the ashes she couldnt deny it so she changed the subject im going to drive down to macon to visit my brother jason this weekend do you suppose edna would be willing to take sam again you know how carsick he gets he nodded he threw up all over my new suburban and the kids blamed me for yelling at him he shrugged sure drop him over hes no trouble all he does is sleep and eat and chew on everything in sight including my best pair of golf shoes i paid for them she smiled thanks charlie jasons wife laura is pregnant and i really wanted to go down and see her before the baby is born she wont have time for me then i imagine shed make time youre not too bad to have around thanks i think and i know how boring those last months of pregnancy can be edna nearly drove me crazy when she was carrying kim of course she was over forty and had a right to be a little crabby lauras thirtyeight and shes too happy she finally got pregnant to be badtempered but shes definitely nesting she smiled besides edna wasnt really crabby she was temperamental you didnt have to live with her he chuckled believe me she was crabby ednas not used to having to sit around with her feet up well laura is definitely not sitting around jason said she was building a gazebo in the backyard so its okay of course its okay his smile faded you need to get out and see people what the hell are you doing spending your day off back here at number ten playing cards with a bunch of guys i like playing cards and i couldnt be happier with anyone than i am with you even though you are all sore losers she put the onions in the pan with the melted butter to saute and started cleaning the mushrooms and youd all become stodgy and boring if i didnt keep you on your toes well you certainly do that he glanced down at the beef but you need to put on a pretty dress and go out and whoop it up havent you got any friends dammit
