 prologue nbsp an hour before dawn on september 3 1798 the waves of the mediterranean tugged at the coast of the island of san pietro near sardinia lullabying the thousand or so sleeping residents so peaceful was it so rhythmic and hypnotic the soundor perhaps it was due to a bottle of local vino biancothat even the two municipal watchmen in the church tower had fallen asleep so there was no one to puzzle out the faint white flecks of sails growing larger on the pinkish gray horizon and no one to ring the massive church bells to sound the alarm that a fleet of seven ships was approaching standing silently at the rail of these lateensailed ships visible in faint silhouette were bearded men in loose billowy pants and turbans carrying scimitars and pistols the vessels packed with one thousand barbary pirates from tunis in north africa glided to anchor inside the harbor the crews quietly lowered small landing boats and began to ferry men ashore the first group barefoot and heavily armed raced to seal off the two roads leading out of townnbsp surprisingly the leader of this attacking moslem fleet the pirate commodore as it were was an italian who had converted to islam the ritual had involved losing his foreskin and gaining a new name he was now mohammed rumelli and in the lingua franca slang of the mediterranean he was dubbed a rinigado a renegade over the centuries the rulers of the barbary countries of algiers tunis and tripoli had learned that christian captains could navigate better than their homegrown moslem talent another italian acting as harbor pilot had guided the fleet to the perfect anchorage this fellow from capri never identified by name carried a deeply personal motive for joining the attack he had married a woman from san pietro but she had abandoned him he was now convinced that she was cuckolding him here on the island he had turned turk expressly to seek his revenge as the first ray of dawn caught the sails muhammed rumelli gave the signal to wake up the townspeople the pirates unleashed a sudden unholy thunder the ships cannons bellowed out broadsides the sailors on shore added a lunatics drum roll of small arms fire the cacaphony climaxed as close to a thousand mouths let loose impassioned arabic war cries and the men rushed into the town allahu akhbar speeded their pursuit of profit the corsairs engulfed the tiny town they battered down the doors burst into homes brandishing torches and scimitars rousting the stunned citizens from bed and kicking them into the streets they cursed their victims as romo kelb christian dogs the women cowered in corners trying to avoid what one observer described as shame and villainies a french naval officer arriving the next day found that five women had died innbsp their beds of knife wounds their bodies entwined in sheets caked with blood the first female victim according to local accounts was the unfaithful wife of that pilot from capri a sardinian historian later called her a fishwife helen who had no idea that her husbands jealous rage had drawn the enemy to her homeland the attackers spent the entire day hauling money jewels church silver silks to the harbor but by far the most valuable commodity to be stolen walked on two legs human slaves surah 47 of the koran allowed these moslem attackers to enslave and ransom any of these captives young italian women would fetch more than the men in the flesh markets of tunis and algiers the crews dragged the townspeople aboard various ships tossing them like ballast willynilly belowdeck into the holds for the 160mile voyage the prisoners wore only what they had slipped into at bedtime on that seemingly unimportant september night which would turn out to be their last night of freedom for half a decade this was life on a mediterranean island circa 1798 in the age of napoleon andnbsp nelson and the waning days of the barbary corsairs the bey of tunis the countrys ruler had commissioned these seven ships and a thousand men to attack san pietro to the bey they were his privateers fighting a legitimate war against sardinia which had refused to pay tribute to him for the right to navigate the mediterranean to the rest of the world these seven ships were barbary pirates part of a centuriesold extortion scheme fall weather on the mediterranean can run skittish and storm winds kicked up the san pietro prisoners spent the next four days seesawing in the windowless foulsmelling dark appalled at their fate vomiting weeping with no sanitation and almost no food or water that is all except six young women six jeunes filles ran a later report in french from a dutch consul antoine nyssen in tunis six young girls alas that they were still so were selected by the rais captains to serve their filthy desires and the most disgusting forms of volupte were their pasttimes during the voyage the ships nearing tunis passed the site of ancient carthage and the captains fired off celebratory cannon shots to signal their victory the city of tunis lies six miles inland from the harbor connected by a stagnant reddishcolored lake the pirates rushed the prisoners aboard small barges boatmen pushing poles then strained to follow a winding route indicated by pillars rising a foot or two above the surface on these pillars standing silent sad wings furled seeming like those birds sculpted on tombs are cormorants wrote french novelist alexander dumas who fifty years later took this same route dumas said the birds of prey would suddenly swoop down on some fish swimming near the surface then calmly return to reassume their cryptlike pose its doubtful that many of the italian captives noticed the wildlife the city soon announced itself by smell as much as by sight the prisoners later learned that fecal ditches run along the northern and eastern walls to receive the human waste from 300000 inhabitants of various races moors arabs turks jews european merchants and diplomats african and christian slaves runoff from the ditches feed into the stagnant shallow lake making the fish poisonous to humans but edible by the likes of cormorants flamingos and seagulls the corsairs swinging leather straps herded the filthy exhausted prisoners through the narrow byways of the whitewashed city on the unusually hot day of september 8 1798 i saw them harassed by blows by fatigue covered in dust and dying of thirst dragging themselves along a burning street barefoot hatless wrote the dutch consul there was a huge crowd drunk with joy to see so many christian victims of the bravery of their soldiers these unfortunate captives staggered forward two hours to the palace where the bey of tunis hamouda in his jeweled turban and diamondencrusted silk vest inspected them for him it was like counting money each of the prisoners was now a slave to be sold at his whim the beys corsairs had captured an astounding 950 people including 702 women and children on the northern coast of africa circa 1800 blacks and whites could still be sold into slaverynbsp men were usually peddled near naked or in dangly shirts in an outdoor auction women could be inspected privately in stalls nearby unlike slave auctions in the southern united states male buyers here openly acknowledged lustful desires for their human purchases matrons inspected the women and virgins were sold at a steep premium often with a written guarantee of all the fears of people living in the 1780s and 1790s a fear perhaps exceeding death itself was the terror of being made a slave on the barbary coast in sermon after sermon it was portrayed as hell in life twentyone freeborn americans had spent eleven years in slavery in algiers from 1785 to 1796 bringing their stories home to the nation foreign consuls begged the bey not to break up the san pietro families not to sell anyone off to algerian slave traders the ruler of tunis set his opening asking price for the women at 600 venetian sequins each about 1371 at a time when a us sailor earned 144 a year he would charge half that amount for the men the bey to save on the costs of feeding and dressing then farmed many of the captives out to the leading citizens of tunis including the representatives of foreign countries who accepted the slaves on humanitarian grounds six years later tobias lear united states consulgeneralnbsp to algiers would accept two female italian slaves to work as housekeepers in the consulate he would expenseaccount their 75ayear upkeep among the san pietro prisoners one young girl stood out strikingly beautiful and of aristocratic birth anna maria porcile was 12 years old a ripe age on the barbary coast a marriageable age she was the grand daughter of the count of santantioco the admiral of the navy of sardinia brought up in a strict catholic household anna had led a sheltered life private tutors taught music literature and dance to this naturally vivacious girl the bey to keep loyalty high among his officers decided to allow his six corsair captains to select one female each as his own personal slave the admiral of the fleet rais muhammed rumelli chose anna rumelli was quoted as saying he had fixed his desire on her he intended her as his concubine unless someone would immediately buy her from him for the record asking price of 16000 piasters or almost 5000 the price of a mansion in manhattan annas entire family had been captured in the raid including her mother barbara her father antonio and her two sisters while the negotiations for the rest of the slaves could drag on over months via shipboard messages to and from sardinia annas fate must be decided quickly rumelli demanded an answer annas father desperately tried to find financing he naturally turned to fellow italians who happened to be in tunis and he fortunately found a tuscan merchant one felipe borzoni who would loan him the entire sum the man paid rais rumelli and anna was suddenly free almost she was the human collateral for her fathers loan the bey would not grant a tiskara or passport to her until the loan was repaid with anna as hostage for her fathers return don antonio porcile was allowed to travel to europe to raise the money but in the chaos of the napoleonic wars he failed so the tuscan merchant sold the debt to the aged prime minister mustapha coggia a man known for his wisdom courtliness and anbsp complete lack of teeth the months of 1799 slipped by and these whiteskinned slaves joined the 2000 or so slaves of various hues laboring in tunis negotiations dragged on the price for the women dropped in half to 300 venetian sequins the exasperated bey to encourage a speedier payment sold eleven to slave traders of algiers nonetheless the king of sardinia harassed by napoleon was unable to redeem his countrymen italian slave mothers gave birth to dozens of new slaves in tunis on oct 10 1800 87 year old mustapha coggiawho held the porcile debtdied and all the prime ministers possessions passed to the bey of tunis the very next day the bey demanded that the porcile family pay off the debt immediately or else the bey said he would reclaim lovely anna and add her to his seraglio or more ominously he said he might instead auction her off in the slave markets of istanbul since the bey made little secret of his preference for men over womenhis foreign minister yussef sapatapa a 33 year old former slave was his loverselling anna was the likelier scenario that afternoon anna and her mother and her sister tried desperately to figure out a way to raise the money her grandfather the admiral had died and her father the new count was at that moment in sardinia still trying to amass the huge sum with absolutely no success the pirates had stolen everything his credit was suspect european banking was a mess the mother and her daughters were running out of options and time they considered the various consulates such as british french danish and the catholic redemptionist charities jewish moneylenders european merchants on that afternoon of october 11 1800 frantic they presented themselves at the door of the consulate of the united states of america a fledgling nation that trumpeted itself as a bastion of freedom they sought refuge under the redwhiteandblue flag which then had 15 stars and 15 stripes and was represented in tunis by one of the most unlikely diplomats ever to be forgotten by history william eaton a former army captain eaton had recently been courtmartialed and convicted he was impetuous hardheaded argumentative his loud voice cut through conversations his ramrod straight stance inspired respect his dartmouth education added polysyllables to his vocabulary diplomacy he had very little he was bluntspoken exceedingly direct he once wrote of the feeble efforts of the us navy that a fleet of quaker meeting houses would have done just as well this bulldog of a man age 35 stood 58 with deep set large blue eyes a friend described his eyes as expressive of energy penetration and authority but also of impatience and disquietude eaton had arrived in tunis on the little merchant brig sophia in 1799 and was immediately appalled here i am under the mad rays of a vertical sun reflected and refracted from wall and terraces of whitewashed houses hotter than tobacco amp rum with plague and scorpions suspended over my head menacing death surrounded by brutal turks swindlers jews perfidious italians miserable slaves lazy camels churlish mules and savage arabs without society and without amusement is not this enough to constitute a hell his irritation only grew as he observed slavery close up for my part it grates me mortally when i see a lazy turk a moslem reclining at his ease upon an embroidered sofa with one christian slave to fan away the flies another to hand him his coffee and a third to hold his pipe it is still more grating to perceive that the turk believes he has a right to demand this contribution and that we like italians have not the fortitude to resist it the united states government with a huge debt from the revolutionary war found it cheaper to pay off tunisand keep the pirates awaythan to fight against them eaton a new england patriot was appalled that the united states would pay bribes to pirates and was deeply annoyed at having personally to hand out diamondencrusted watches gold watches pairs of goldmounted pistols gold tobacco boxes silks and many others items to sixty different government officials in tunis from the bey and admiral down to the infamously ugly eunuch who guarded the beys harem the darkskinned giant with the raspy meuling infants voice the porcile women stood crying before william eaton annas honor hung in the balance imagination better than language can paint their distress eaton later wrote from a conviction about freedom that literally had its roots near plymouth rock with eatons great great grandfather he could not abide this form of persecution against all common sense eaton agreed to guarantee a six month loan for annas father allowing himself to stand as surety for the repayment of 5000 i ransomed your daughter eaton later wrote to the count because being in my house both the honor of my flag and my own sensibility dictated it if at the end of six months count porcile couldnt pay then eaton was obligated to do so what is striking is that eaton at that moment had absolutely no money at least none of his own and yet he was committing to pay a small fortune to rescue an italian slave girl impetuously for honor william eaton throughout his life would be drawn to commit deeds that he considered righteous and others would consider reckless his flurry of letters to count porcile received eloquent replies but no money and in june of 1801 the homosexual lover of the bey yussef sapatapa told eaton that he must repay the 5000 eaton after failing to raise money through trading ventures was now forced to borrow the large sum from a tunisian merchant named unis ben unis in february of 1803 to show some force and fend off any threat of war the united states sent armed ships to tunis an old barbary maxim states whoever acts like a sheep the wolf will eat so the young united states did not want to be mistaken for a sheep commodore richard morris with captain john rodgers arrived in three heavily armed frigates the mission seemed successful the odd new nation across the atlantic did indeed have a navy but as commodore morris in blue uniform with gold epaulettes was about to embark to cross that stagnant lake to go to the harbor he was suddenly arrested because of the thousands of dollars of debt of william eaton the highest ranking united states navy officer found himself surrounded bynbsp tunisians wielding scimitars and he was forced to return to the city it was impossible to apprehend that the respect attached to the person of the commodore would be violated eaton wrote it is unprecedented even in the history of barbary outrage commodore richard morrisa scion of the wealthy morris family of vermont whose brother had cast the deciding ballot to elect jefferson over burrwas furious with eaton he assumed that the mans debts were mostly personal eaton morris and unis ben unis walked to the palace where bey hamouda wearing a jeweled silk cloak greeted them on his luxurious sofa eaton vehemently denied that he had ever promised to repay unis ben unis whenever the american squadron arrived unis demanded payment of 22000 of that 5000 came from eatons ransom of anna and 10000 came from sapatapa claiming that eaton hadnbsp promised him a large bribe and the remaining 7000 from a commercial dispute eaton snapped he called the beys lover the prime minister a thief to his face and said all he had experienced in tunis was violence and indignity the bey unaccustomed to contretemps shouted over and over that eaton was mad eyewitnesses said that the beys lip trembled and he oddly clutched his mustache as he yelled i will turn you out of my kingdom when the bey had calmed down he told the commodore the consul is a man of a good heart but a bad head he is too obstinate and too violent for me i must have a consul with a disposition more congenial to the barbary interests nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp commodore morris had no appetite for remaining in tunis for fighting for the loudmouthed consul he agreed to replace eaton and to pay off the 22000 he later wrote as security for the money paid by me i insisted on mr eaton assigning all his real and personal estate to the government on march 10 1803 eaton boarded the us chesapeake he was on the verge of ruin disgraced as a diplomat he was returning home to his wife he was financially devastated this last twist was ironic since eaton had accepted the post of consul to tunis in the hopes that he might make enough money to reenter his marriage as the financial equal of eliza a widow of a wealthy revolutionary war general i hope the hour is not far distant he had written to her before the disasternbsp when i may demonstrate to the world that it was not mrs danielsons fortune but her person that captain eaton married in his official report morris stated that eaton appeared to be a man of lively imagination rash credulous and by no means possessed of sound judgement within two years this disgraced diplomat would lead a band of eight marines eight and several hundred foreign mercenaries the dregs of alexandria on a mad hopeless mission to march across the hell of the libyan desert he would try to finance the mission with the funds owed to him for ransoming anna the italian slave girl thomas jefferson would send eaton on americas first covert military op overseas to try to overthrow the government of tripoli in order to free the three hundred american sailors enslaved there this man on the verge of personal ruin joined by his handful of marines including violinplaying presley obannon would surpriseattack tripolis second largest city and they would achieve a near miraculous victory he would help stamp the then second class service the united states marines with a new reputation for courage his exploits would lead future generations of americans to sing proudly from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli we will fight our countrys battles on the land and on the sea in 1805 in the first decades of our north american experiment in democracy when the nations future prosperity was very much in doubt william eaton made one of the loudest statements to the world that the united states was not a country to be mocked or bullied while politicians and military officers mouthed the same patriotic phrases eaton risked his life to back up his statements he helped set a national tone of defiance and daring but in william eatons flinty outspokenness and fearlessness there lurked the seeds of his own destruction thomas jefferson could not abide the mans relentless belligerence the aftermath of victory in tripoli for eaton would be less than sweet after taking on tripoli and the barbary pirates he would challenge and defy thomas jefferson it would be a battle between unequals and no good can come of that
