 chapter one desert fox the tomahawks were spinning up in their tubes it was november 12 1998 us marine general tony zinni the commander in chief of united states central command centcom was standing in his command room overlooking the command center at centcoms tampa florida headquarters leading the preparations for what promised to be the most devastating attack on iraq since the 1991 gulf war the spacious command center was fitted out with desks phones computers maps and large and small screens showing updates and the positions of aircraft and ships in addition to the usual officetype furnishings the windowed room had secure phones and video communications with zinnis superiors and his commanders in the field it was zinnis battle positionthe bridge of his ship at the end of the first gulf war iraq had agreed to the unsupervised destruction of its weapons of mass destruction wmd and the programs to develop and build them that agreement had been a lie the saddam hussein regime had never intended to give up its wmd program and for the next seven years it had conducted a running battle with unscom the un inspection operation in iraq to protect its programs in any way possible by hiding them moving them around lying stonewalling delay and noncooperation the two essential issues covered by the un mandate were compliance and accountability that is the inspectors had to ask and get satisfactory answers to these questions are the iraqis in compliance with the un requirement to destroy their wmd and completely dismantle their wmd programs and are they satisfactorily accounting for the programs and wmd they claim to have destroyed the absence of iraqi cooperation on both of these issues led unscom to make the obvious assumption that the iraqis were hiding somethingeither that the weapons still existed or that the iraqis at least wanted to maintain their capability to make them unscom had to look hard at the worst case when unscom had persisted in carrying out the un mandate the iraqis had raised the stakesby making it ever harder for unscom to do its job there had been greater and greater threats and intimidation lies obstruction and hostility allied with a diplomatic assault aimed at splitting off powerful states friendly to iraq principally france russia and china from the rest of the security council and using their support to sabotage the disarmament effort with each iraqi escalation came a counterthreat from the united states if unscom is forced to leave iraq with their work unfinished the us will hit iraq and hit it hard the threat caught the iraqis attention as each escalation neared its climax and the inspectors started to pull out of the country the saddam hussein regime blinked backed down and let them returnthough each time with fewer teeth but now it looked like the iraqis were not going to blink the day before november 11 the un inspection teams had left once again apparently for good as they left president clinton had given zinni the signal to go the twentyfourhour launch clock had started zinni knew the moment was approaching for the cruise missile launchthe moment of truth these werent airplanes once the tomahawks were in the air they could not be recalled before him was an open line to the white house where the joint chiefs of staff jcs vicechairman air force general joe ralston was sitting before him too was another line to his navy component commander vice admiral willy moore in bahrain moore was in constant communications with the eight ships that would launch the initial cruise missile salvo the clock ticked on the twentyfour hours passed zinni had told the president that the strike could be stopped at any moment up to six hours before the bombs were scheduled to hit that was the dropdead time for a nogo decision as it happened he had built in fifteen minutes of fudge time as a safety margin but the nogo deadline had passed and so had zinnis fifteen minutes of fudge time he took a deep breathand then the line from the white house lit up saddam was backing down again hed agreed to unscoms demands general ralstons voice came down the wire its a nogo dont shoot he told zinni do we have any time left is it okay zinni honestly didnt know all he could do was grab the phone and call willy moore for zinni this story had begun fifteen months before on august 13 1997 when hed been appointed the sixth cinc commander in chief of centcom as commander zinni watched over a vast region including most of the middle east east africa and southwest and central asia his challenges were legion the delicate complex relationships with his regional allies the rising threat of terrorism led by the not yet worldfamous osama bin laden the growing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the chronic problems of failed or incapable states civil wars border disputes and criminal activities such as drug trafficking and smuggling and the difficult task of containing the two regional hegemons iran and iraq though he would have preferred a balanced approach to all the regional issues rather than having to concentrate his energies and centcoms capabilities on americas obsession with saddam hussein by far zinnis biggest challenge proved to be enforcing the unimposed postgulf war sanctions on saddams regime in his view saddam could be contained and marginalized making him the issue only gave him more clout and distracted the us from more important regional issues such as the israelipalestinian peace process iran terrorism and the building of security relationships not long after he became cinc he proposed a sixpoint strategic program to william cohen president clintons secretary of defense aimed at this more balanced approach after a polite hearing with cohen and a session with the senate majority and minority leaders and the speaker of the house zinni was told to stay out of policy and to stick to execution yes sir he saidalways a good marine meanwhile the magnitude of the iraq problem was once again brought home only five days after he took command at an extended meeting at centcom headquarters with ambassador richard butler the new head of unscom centcom provided support for unscom with unsupervised u2 flights over iraq zinni was already familiar with these missions before his appointment as commander he had as general peays deputy coordinated the centcom support missions with butlers predecessor rolf ekeus on the face of it unscoms mandate was straightforward un resolution 687 which set up unscom and which iraq had accepted and agreed to support had directed iraq to destroy remove or render harmless its wmd and any missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers this process was to have three stages iraq would declare its wmd and missiles unscom would verify the declaration as accurate and then together unscom and the iraqis would destroy them the iraqis had given ekeus a hard time but his problems were nothing compared with the obstacles they were already putting in the way of his successor iraqi efforts to conceal their wmd programstheir hideous charade in butlers wordswere to have dramatic consequences for tony zinni though tony zinni did not look like a recruiting poster he was instantly recognizable as a marine he was slightly under medium height solidly built barrelchested with dark hair cut in the jarhead marine fashionvery short with shaved back and sides his look was normally intent thoughtful direct and friendly laughter came easily to him and he had the social openness warmth and common touch that came from long exposure to all kinds and varieties of people hardened by a lifetime of military serviceand most especially by vietnam which had radically changed himtough decisions didnt faze him before becoming the head of unscom richard butler had been the australian ambassador to the un with considerable expertise in arms control and wmd issues like zinni he came out of a workingclass urban catholic background zinni grew up in philadelphia butler in sydney and like zinni he was a burly physically imposing man friendly direct outspoken and tough not surprisingly the two men connected easily both men listened well and were not reluctant to express their views butlers first words to zinni made it clear that he would not play favorites hed call the pitches as he saw them but a successful outcome to the inspections was all up to the iraqis if they opened up and came clean with their missiles and wmd he would give them a clean bill of health and theyd get their rewardthe lifting of the draconian sanctions imposed as a consequence of their invasion of kuwait in 1990 so far they had shown zero inclination to come cleananything butwhile crying crocodile tears over their fellow iraqis who were enduring the terrible sanctions imposed by the american satan saddams henchmen meanwhile lived royally in palaces when it came down to the naked truth saddams regime was far more interested in keeping their wmd and missile programs than in lifting the sanctions yet if they could get the sanctions removed while keeping their wmd all the better butler had no illusions about the other players in this highstakes game either he was well aware that the americans had their own agendanot to mention the un bureaucracy the french the russians the chinese and everyone else with a stake in what went on inside the nation with the worlds secondlargest proven oil reserves a nation whose government was arguably the most repressive since stalins ussr the iraqis well aware of these agendas played everyone off against each other trying various gambits aimed at ending or at least weakening unscomfrom conning butler to putting a wedge in the security council to appealing to the secretarygeneral for a diplomatic solution meaning a diplomatic surrender to iraq the iraqis rightly believed that the french russians and chinese would stand to gain if the sanctions were removed but their backing had conditions it had to be covered over by a mask of support for the previous resolutions calling for disarmament the iraqis also rightly believed that the secretarygeneral and his staff were hopeful of attaining a diplomatic solution even if that meant sacrificing the security councils goal of achieving iraqi disarmament the us agenda was even more subtle and complex the americans were increasingly coming to understand that disarmament would never happen with saddam in power it was therefore not in their interest for the iraqis to be seen to comply with un directives and thus to have the sanctions lifted in the american view if saddam appeared to comply with the inspectors seemed to meet the conditions set by the un resolution and was given a clean bill of health then he would no doubt restart the wmd programs he had not successfully protected from inspection as time passed the americans goal for iraq shifted from the wmdsanctions equation to regime changea goal they could not openly advocate because of the un resolutions they had backed yet it was clear they had no intention of dropping the sanctions as long as saddam husseins regime ran iraq the american policy shift did not make richard butlers job any easier it obviously meant there was no motivation for saddam to comply with the un conditions if the regime and not the wmd was the issue then there was no reason for them not to keep the wmd programs of course that was an excuse and not a reason saddam intended to keep his programs no matter what over the next months the iraqis did their best to scam butler the scam didnt work as they realized he was not a pushoverand was becoming increasingly exasperated by their lies and tricksthey ratcheted up the stakes with attempts at intimidation by the end of october 1997 they were putting more and more obstacles in the way of the unscom inspectors and making serious and quite naked threats at this point they had two immediate goals to protect several key sites they had designated presidential and to remove anything american from the inspection process including the u2 flights of the approximately one thousand unscom inspection staff about a quarter were american meanwhile the iraqi failure to cooperate had provoked centcom contingency plans for retaliatory air strikes though there had been us strikes against the iraqis before zinni became cinc they had been relatively limited zinnis strikes were intended to hurt the crisis came to a head in early november when the iraqis ordered all the american inspectors to leave iraq and threatened to shoot down the u2 although hitting the highflying aircraft would have taken a very lucky shot it was possible the question how to respond to the threat a u2 mission was scheduled for november 10 obviously an attempt to knock it out would be followed by american bombs but was the threat alone reason enough to hit saddam that was zinnis position he did not favor flying the mission preferring instead to strike iraq immediately based on the threat or else to punish them in other ways such as increasing the airspace in the nofly zonenodrive zone enforcement area but washington thought otherwise their decision was to fly the u2 and zinni was ordered to be prepared to conduct immediate air and missile attacks on iraq if the plane was fired upon in preparation for the strike he flew out to the friendly countries in the gulf to secure agreements to use their airspace bases and territorial waters for the strikea round of visits he would make several times as head of centcom on the way he visited the u2 pilots at their base in saudi arabia there he learned that the squadron commander had decided to fly the flight himself an act that impressed zinni who later awarded him an air medal for flying into the engagement zones of hostile iraqi surfacetoair missiles getting agreement from the friendly leaders in the region was not automatic they were nervous about the strike though none had any illusions about the iraqi leader they all had a great deal of sympathy for the longsuffering iraqi peoplearabs just as they were a solution that did nothing for the iraqi people made no sense to them thus they all backed an attack that would remove saddam but in their minds yet another round of pinprick bombings only made him stronger in the end however they agreed to a strike if the u2 was fired upon despite their serious questions about the benefits of the us air strikes they always came through with their support contrary to us media reports but preferred to keep the extent of their support private the u2 flew as scheduled on november 10 during the flight zinni sat with senior saudi leaders in the saudi ministry of defense in riyadh but in direct communication with centcoms air operations center ready to give the order to strike at the first indication that the plane was threatened as had often happened before saddams threat turned out to be hollow the flight was uneventful on november 14 in the face of the iraqi demand to remove the americans butler evacuated the entire contingent of inspectors but after several days of intense diplomatic activity they were all able to returnthough once again with less freedom to operate than before every diplomatic solution lessened unscoms ability to get the disarmament job done meanwhile the iraqi lies and threats did not stop and over the next months saddam raised the stakes again and againalways probing for weaknesses always trying to limit unscoms effectiveness in response centcom built up forces in the region to be ready to strike if the inspectors were no longer able to do their business this operation became known as desert thunder in february secretary of defense cohen and zinni conducted a fourday trip to eleven countries to gain support for a major air strike if butlers inspectors were unable to carry out their mission by february 17 when a confrontation with saddam seemed imminent president clinton announced in a televised speech that the us would act if he did not cooperate with the inspectors zinni briefed the president and key cabinet members on the planned strike and defense of american allies in the region but once again saddam made a lastminute retreat a february 20 visit to baghdad by un secretarygeneral kofi annan got an agreement from saddam to resume cooperation with butler yet it was clearly only a matter of time before this cooperation would collapse meanwhile the us forces that had been added to the units already in the region remained in the gulf poised to strike from battle ready by tom clancy with general tony zinni ret and tony koltz copyright copy 2004 cp commanders inc
