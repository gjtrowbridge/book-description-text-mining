 spring 1086 england the ravens were the first sign as the horsedrawn wagon traveled down the rutted track between rolling fields of barley a flock of ravens rose up in a black wash they hurled themselves into the blue of the morning and swept high in a panicked rout but this was more than the usual startled flight the ravens wheeled and swooped tumbled and flapped over the road they crashed into each other and rained down out of the skies small bodies struck the road breaking wing and beak they twitched in the ruts wings fluttered weakly but most disturbing was the silence of it all no caws no screams just the frantic beat of wingthen the soft impact of feathered bodies on the hard dirt and broken stone the wagons driver crossed himself and slowed the cart his heavylidded eyes watched the skies the horse tossed its head and huffed into the chill of the morning keep goingsaid the traveler sharing the wagon martin borr was the youngest of the royal coroners ordered here upon a secret edict from king william himself as martin huddled deeper into his heavy cloak he remembered the note secured by wax and imprinted by the great royal seal burdened by the cost of war king william had sent scores of royal commissioners out into the countryside to amass a great accounting of the lands and properties of his kingdom the immense tally was being recorded in a mammoth volume called the domesday book collected together by a single scholar and written in a cryptic form of latin the accounting was all done as a means of measuring the proper tax owed to the crown or so it was said some grew to suspect there was another reason for such a grand survey of all the lands they compared the book to the bibles description of the last judgment where god kept an accounting of all mankinds deeds in the book of life whispers and rumors began calling the result of this great survey the doomsday book these last were closer to the truth than anyone suspected martin had read the waxsealed letter hed observed that lone scribe painstakingly recording the results of the royal commissioners into the great book and at the end hed watched the scholar scratch a single word in latin written in red ink vastare wasted many regions were marked with this word indicating lands that had been laid to waste by war or pillage but two entries had been inscribed entirely in crimson ink one described a desolate island that lay between the coast of ireland and the english shore martin approached the other place now ordered here to investigate at the behest of the king he had been sworn to secrecy and given three men to assist him they trailed behind the wagon on their own horses at martins side the driver twitched the reins and encouraged the draft horse a monstrously huge chestnut to a faster clop as they continued forward the wheels of the wagon drove over the twitching bodies of the ravens crushing bones and splattering blood finally the cart topped a rise and revealed the breadth of the rich valley beyond a small village lay nestled below flanked by a stone manor house at one end and a steepled church on the other a score of thatched cottages and longhouses made up the rest of the hamlet along with a smattering of wooden sheepfolds and small dovecotes tis a cursed place milord the driver said mark my words it were no pox that has blasted this place that is what weve come to discern a league behind them the steep road had been closed off by the kings army none were allowed forward but that did not stop rumors of the strange deaths from spreading to the neighboring villages and farmsteads cursed the man mumbled again as he set his cart down the road toward the village i heard tell that these lands once belonged to the heathen celts said to be sacred to their pagan ways their stones can still be found in the forests off in the highlands up yonder his withered arm pointed toward the woods fringing the high hills that climbed heavenward mists clung to those forests turning the green wood into murky shades of gray and black theyve cursed this place i tell you straight bringing doom upon those who bear the cross martin borr dismissed such superstitions at thirtytwo years of age he had studied with master scholars from rome to britannia he had come with experts to discover the truth here shifting around martin waved the others ahead toward the small hamlet and the trio set off at a canter each knew his duty martin followed more slowly studying and assessing all he passed isolated in this small upland valley the village went by the name highglen and was known locally for its pottery forged from mud and clay gathered out of the hot springs that contributed to the mists cloaking the higher forests it was said that the towns method of kilning and the composition of the potters clay were tightly guarded secrets known only to the guild here and now they were lost forever the wagon trundled down the road passing more fields rye oats beans and rows of vegetables some of the fields showed signs of recent harvesting while others showed evidence of being set to torch had the villagers grown to suspect the truth as the wagon continued down into the valley lines of sheep pens appeared fringed by tall hedges that half hid the horror within wooly mounds the bloated bodies of hundreds of sheep dotted the overgrown meadows closer to the village pigs and goats also appeared sprawled and sunkeneyed dead where theyd dropped off in a field a largeboned ox had collapsed still tethered to its plow as the wagon reached the village green the town remained silent no bark of dog greeted them no crow of rooster no bray of donkey the church bell didnt ring and no one called out to the strangers entering the village a heavy silence pressed down over the place as they would discover most of the dead still lay within their houses too weak at the end to venture out but one body sprawled facedown on the green not far from the manor houses stone steps he lay like he might have just fallen perhaps tripped down the steps and broken his neck but even from the height of the wagon martin noted the gaunt stretch of skin over bone the hollow eyes sunken into the skull the thinness of limbs it was the same wasting as in the beasts of the field it was as if the entire village had been under siege and had been starved out the clatter of hooves approached reginald pulled beside the wagon granaries are all full he said dusting off his palms on his pants the tall scarred man had overseen campaigns by king william in the north of france found rats and mice in the bins too martin glanced over to him as dead as everything else just like that cursed island but now the wasting has reached our shores martin muttered entered our lands it was the reason theyd all been sent here why the village road was under guard and why their group had been sworn to secrecy with binding oaths girard found you a good body reginald said fresher than most a boy hes set im up in the smithy his heavy arm pointed to a wooden barn with a stackedstone chimney martin nodded and climbed out of the wagon he had to know for sure and there was only one way to find out as royal coroner this was his duty to discern the truth from the dead though at the moment hed leave the bloodiest work to the french butcher martin crossed to the smithys open door girard stood inside hunched before the cold forge the frenchman had labored in king williams army where hed sawed off limbs and did his best to keep the soldiers alive girard had cleared a table in the center of the smithy and already had the boy stripped and tied to the table martin stared at the pale emaciated figure his own son was about the same age but the manner of this death had aged the poor lad here made him seem wizened well beyond his eight or nine years as girard prepared his knives martin examined the boy more closely he pinched the skin and noted the lack of fat beneath he examined the cracked lips the flaky patches of hair loss the swollen ankles and feet but mostly he ran his hands over the protuberant bones as if trying to read a map with his fingers ribs jaw eye socket pelvis what had happened martin knew any real answers lay much deeper girard crossed to the table with a long silver blade in his hand shall we get to work monsieur martin nodded a quarter hour later the boys corpse lay on the board like a gutted pig the skin splayed from groin to gullet had been pulled and tacked to the wooden table intestines lay nestled and curled tight in the bloodied cavity bloated and pink from under the ribs a brownishyellow liver swelled outward too large for one so small for one so wasted to bone and gristle girard reached into the belly of the boy his hands vanished into the gelid depths on the far side martin touched his forehead and mouthed a silent prayer of forgiveness for this trespass but it was too late for absolution from the boy all the lads body could do was confirm their worst fears girard hauled forth the boys stomach rubbery and white from which hung a swollen purple spleen with a few slices of his knife the frenchman freed the section of gut and dropped it on the table another whispery slip of blade and the stomach was laid open a rich green mix of undigested bread and grain spilled over the board like some foul horn of plenty a fetid smell rolled out ripe and potent martin covered his mouth and nosenot against the stench but against the horrible certainty starved to death that is plain girard said but the boy starved with a full belly martin stepped back his limbs going cold here was his proof they would have to examine others to be certain but the deaths here seemed to be the same as those on the island a place marked in red ink as wasted in the domesday book martin stared at the gutted boy here was the secret reason the survey had been undertaken to begin with to search for this blight on their homeland to stamp it out before it spread the deaths were the same as on that lonely island the deceased appeared to eat and eat yet they still starved to death finding no nourishment only a continual wasting needing air martin turned from the table and stepped out of shadows and into sunshine he stared across at the rolling hills green and fertile a wind swept down and combed through the fields of barley and oats wheat and rye he pictured a man adrift in the ocean dying of thirst with water all around him but unable to drink this was no different martin shivered in the wan sunlight wanting to be as far away from this valley as possible but a shout drew his attention to the right toward the other end of the village green a figure dressed all in black stood before an open door for a moment martin feared it was death himself but then the figure waved shattering the illusion it was abbot orren the final member of their group the head of the abbey of kells in ireland he stood at the entrance to the village church come see this the abbot shouted martin stumbled toward him it was more a reflex than a conscious effort he did not want to return to the smithy he would leave the boy to the care of the french butcher martin crossed the village green climbed the steps and joined the catholic monk what is it abbot orren the man turned and headed into the church tis blasphemy the irish abbot spat out to defile the place in such a manner no wonder they were all slain martin hurried after the abbot the man was skeletally thin and ghostly in his oversized traveling cloak of them all he was the only one to have visited the island off the coast of ireland to have seen the wasting there too did you find what you were seeking martin asked the abbot did not answer and stepped back into the crude church martin had no choice but to follow the interior was gloomy a cheerless place with an earthen floor covered in rushes there were no benches and the roof was low and heavily raftered the only light came from a pair of high thin windows at the back of the church they cast dusty streaks of light upon the altar which was a single slab of stone an altar cloth must have once covered the raw stone but it had been torn away and cast to the floor most likely by the abbot in his search abbot orren crossed to the altar and pointed to the bare stone with a trembling arm his shoulders shook with his anger blasphemy he repeated to carve these heathen symbols upon our lords house martin closed the distance and leaned closer to the altar the stone had been inscribed with sunbursts and spirals with circles and strange knotted shapes all clearly pagan why would these pious people commit such a sin i dont think it was the villagers of highglen martin said he ran his hand over the altar under his fingertips he sensed the age of the markings the worn nature of the inscribed shapes these were clearly old martin remembered his drivers assertion that this place was cursed that it was hallowed ground to the ancient celtic people and that their giant stones could be found hidden in the misty highland forests martin straightened one of those stones must have been hauled to highglen and used to form the altar of the village church if its not the people here who did it then how do you explain this the abbot asked he moved to the wall behind the altar and waved an arm to encompass the large marking there it had been painted recently and from the brownishred color possibly with blood it depicted a circle with a cross cutting through it martin had seen such markings on burial stones and ancient ruins it was a sacred symbol of the celtic priesthood a pagan cross martin said we found the same on the island marked on all the doors but what does it mean the abbot fingered the silver cross at his own neck it is as the king feared the snakes who plagued ireland who were driven off our island by saint patrick have come to these shores martin knew the abbot was not referring to true serpents of the field but to the pagan priests who carried staffs curled like snakes to the druid leaders of the ancient celtic people saint patrick had converted or driven off the pagans from irelands shores but that had been six centuries ago martin turned to stare out of the church toward the dead village girards words echoed in his head the boy starved with a full belly none of it made any sense the abbot mumbled behind him it must all be burned the soil sowed with salt martin nodded but a worry grew in his breast could any flame truly destroy what was wrought here he did not know for sure but he was certain about one thing this was not over
