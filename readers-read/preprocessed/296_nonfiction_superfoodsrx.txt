 chapter one how your diet is killing you the foods you eat every day from the fast food you mindlessly consume to the best meals you savor in a top restaurant are doing much more than making you fat or thin their effects on your body are making the difference between the development of chronic disease and a vigorous extended life they can prevent or greatly reduce your risk of vision problems stroke heart disease diabetes and a host of killers these are not just vague promises they are facts that are now supported by an impressive and irrefutable body of research most respectable scientists in the world today agree that at least 30 percent of all cancers are directly related to nutrition some would argue that the figure is as high as 70 percent for example we know that the people who eat the most fruits and vegetables are half as likely to develop cancer as those who eat the least amount of these foods its not just cancer thats nutrition related about half of all cardiovascular disease and a significant percentage of hypertension cases can be traced to diet as well in the nurses health study an ongoing study of over 120000 female nurses begun in framingham massachusettsin 1976 the nonsmoking women with a median daily intake of 27 servings of whole grains were half as likely to suffer a stroke as other women in the study given this its particularly alarming to learn that fewer than 8 percent of americans eat this much whole grains indeed most of us are eating ourselves to death only about 10 percent of americans eat the foods that would enable them to be free of chronic disease and premature death our western diets are literally killing us while man evolved on a plantbased diet more than fifty thousand years agoour modern diet the one our parents ate and the one were eating developed only during the past fifty to eighty years it is not serving us well we humans are genetically wired for starvation not an overabundance of food our genes are set for huntergatherer mode and a diet rich in fruits vegetables whole grains nuts and seeds and lean wild game not for the majority of foods and beverages found in todays supermarkets it has been estimated that 300000 to 800000 preventable deaths per year in the united states are nutrition related these include deaths from atherosclerotic disease diabetes and certain cancers here are eleven disastrous developments in nutrition that are ruining your health and the health of most everyone in modern industrialized societies increased portion sizes decreased energy expenditure people just dont exercise enough unhealthy balance of fats in the dietan increase in saturated fat omega6 fatty acids and transfatty acids along with a huge decrease in omega3 fatty acids an increase in consumption of processed cereal grains an overall decrease in fruit and vegetable intake from historical standards a decrease in lean meat and fish intake a decrease in antioxidant intake and calcium intake especially from whole foods the unhealthy ratio of omega6 to omega3 fatswhich is associated with a long list of chronic diseases a marked increase in refined sugar as an overall percentage of caloric intake a decrease in whole food consumption which has led to a marked decrease in phytonutrient intake a decrease in the variety of foods eaten few people including health professionals are aware of the significant recent decline in our overall health status more than 125 million americans have at least one chronic condition like diabetes cancer heart disease or glaucoma the centers for disease control estimates that onethird of americans who were born in 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime sixty million americans have more than one condition its getting worse every day in 1996 estimates were made projecting the rate of chronic disease in the future four years later in 2000 the number of people with chronic ailments was twenty million higher than had been anticipated by the year 2020 a projected onequarter of the american population will be living with multiple chronic conditions and estimated costs for managing these conditions will reach 107 trillion the most shocking nugget of information in this dismal overview of american health is that the age of the chronically ill is declining about half of chronically ill americans are under age 45 and stunningly 15 percent of that number are children who are suffering from diabetes asthma developmental disabilities cancer and other disorders as a doctor i see the imperfections of the system every day the general unspoken assumption among many people is that you can eat whatever you feel like eating and count on a pill or a surgery to take care of the fallout down the line for many of us the only dietrelated concern if we have one is weight control recognizing the crisis in pediatric health care for the first time in the spring of 2003 the american heart association has offered guidelines for screening kids they include check a childs blood pressure at every visit after age 3 talk to kids about not smoking as early as age 9 test cholesterol levels and blood fats in kids who are overweight or at risk review family history for signs of early heart disease whats the answer clearly we need to do better if we want to live longer and avoid chronic disease
