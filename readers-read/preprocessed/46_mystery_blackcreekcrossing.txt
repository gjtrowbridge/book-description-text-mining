 chapter 1 as the last bell of the day rang angel sullivan sat quietly in her seat in the last row of mr englishs room and waited for her classmates to disappear before she even started stowing her books in her backpack finally when even the chatter in the corridor outside the room had died down she stood up to pull on her jacket you okay angel the teacher asked peering worriedly at her from behind his desk okay she repeated silently to herself how could she be okay after what had happened this morning and if mr english didnt know what was wrong how was she going to explain it to him after all it had happened right there during the first period just before the bell sounded when mr english asked the class if they wanted to sing happy birthday to her happy birthday like it was still third grade didnt he know that none of her classmates even spoke to her except to say mean things so there shed sat in her seat in the last row her face burning with embarrassment as a horrible silence fell over the room and half the class turned to stare at her the only thing that saved her from bursting into tears of humiliation was that the bell had rung then everyone rushed for the door and now mr english wanted to know if she was okay biting her lip but saying nothing she hurried toward the door and the safety of the corridor beyond which with any luck would now be empty angel she heard mr english but was already out of the room the door swinging shut behind her angel what kind of name was angel for a long timewell maybe not all that long but for a while anywayshe had thought it was a wonderful name maybe the most wonderful name in the world even now memories of phrases from when she was barely more than a baby echoed softly in her mind daddys little angel mommys little angel grammys perfect little angel it had been grammy who gave her the very first halloween costume she could remember it was a white dress that angel was certain had been made of satin but her mother insisted was only cheap muslin but it didnt matter because it had white sequins sewn all over it that glittered even when she was standing as still as she possibly could on the back of the dress there were two wings grammy had made of papiermch and then covered with white feathers ive been saving them ever since you were born grammy had told her as she carefully fitted the wings onto her tiny threeyearold shoulders some people might tell you theyre only seagull feathers but dont you believe them but if they didnt come from seagulls where did they come fromangel had asked angels grammy told her looking deep into her eyes angels just like you they come to me when i dream and leave feathers on my pillow feathers from real angels for my own perfect little angel angel still had those wings but they no longer hung on the wall of her room as they once had now they were wrapped in tissue paper and packed away in an old hat box shed found in the basement of the house they lived in when she was nine and even though her mother thought they should be thrown away angel knew they never would be they were all she had to remind her of grammy who died a little while after that wonderful halloween when shed worn the angel costume and grammy held her hand and led her up to the porches decorated with jackolanterns angel remembered being too shy to knock on the doors herself and too terrified of the strangers who answered the doors to call out trick or treat so grammy had done that for her too then even before all her halloween candy was gone grammy had died and she had been alone ever since with only the wonderful feathered wings to remember her grandmother by
