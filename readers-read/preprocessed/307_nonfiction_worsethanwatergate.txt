 george w bush and richard b cheney have created the most secretive presidency of my lifetime their secrecy is far worse than during watergate and it bodes even more serious consequences their secrecy is extreme151not merely unjustified and excessive but obsessive it has created a white house that hides its presidents weaknesses as well as its vice presidents strengths it has given us a presidency that operates on hidden agendas to protect their secrets bush and cheney dissemble as a matter of policy in fact the bushcheney presidency is strikingly nixonian only with regard to secrecy far worse and no one will ever successfully accuse me of being a nixon apologist dick cheney who runs his own secret governmental operations openly declares that he wants to turn the clock back to the prewatergate years151a time of an unaccountable and extraconstitutional imperial presidency to say that their secret presidency is undemocratic is an understatement im anything but skittish about government but i must say this administration is truly scary andgiven the times we live in frighteningly dangerous this conclusion is not that of a political partisan for those days are long behind me rather it is the finding of a concerned observer with something of a distinct understanding and appreciation of the modern presidency i was initially astonished watching the bushcheney presidency not certain they realized the very familiar path at least to methat they were taking richard nixon who resigned his presidency thirty years ago had many admirable strengths and qualities his secrecy which shielded his abuses of presidential power was not among them thus from time to time i fired off flares hoping to throw a bit of light151if not a warning151on where they were headed i did so by raising these matters in my regular findlaw column for one such columnin which i discussed the potential of impeachment if the bush administration had intentionally manipulated government intelligence on iraqs weapons of mass destruction an editor at salon which reprinted the column used the title worse than watergate 151drawing his own conclusion from the material three months later chris matthews of msnbc s hardball described the bush administrations revengeful act of leaking the name and cia identity of the wife of an administration critic former ambassador joseph wilsonas worse than watergate for the leak was potentially lifethreatening given her undercover statusas well as against the law matthews made this comment in an exchange with the chairman of the republican national committee ed gillespie who to my surprise did not disagree so while i cant claim original authorship for the titlewhen my editor suggested it for this book i could not deny that it describes perfectly what i have to say in more ways than i had anticipated this book began as an admonition an approach both beware of bush and bush beware only ignorance or bliss i figured at the time could lead another president and white house to make the same kind of mistakes we made during nixons presidency as i proceeded howeverand the post911 activities and operations of bush and cheney unfolded it was evident that these were carefully calculated policies and plans no longer was i writing a warning but rather an indictment for i could not write and publish fast enough to get in front of the abuses of power and the emerging endsjustifythemeans mentality and even if i could have it would not have made any difference for they understood exactly what they were doing and why stated a bit differently ive been watching all the elements fall into place for two possible political catastrophes one that will take the air out of the bushcheney balloon and the other far more disquieting will take the air out of democracyallow me to explain to compare the bushcheney presidency with nixons tenure and watergate and assert that it is worse than watergate is not a charge to be made lightly nor do i151watergate symbolizes totally unacceptable presidential behavior dictionary definitions of the term watergate typically describe this unacceptable conduct as the abuse of presidential power or high office for political purposes watergate of course was a very messy presidential scandal and a political disaster for nixon certainly no comparable scandal has occurred during the bushcheney tenure151at least not yet scandals have a way of smoldering before erupting as has occurred with every major presidential scandal151teapot dome watergate irancontra and laffaire lewinsky there are simply too many problems rumbling just below the surface of the bushcheney presidency to avoid making the comparison former attorney general and later secretary of state william rogers once advised that the public should view excessive secrecy among government officials as parents view sudden quiet where youngsters are playing it is a sign of trouble woodrow wilson based on his long study of statecraft concluded that everybody knows that corruption thrives in secret places and avoids public placesand we believe it a fair presumption that secrecy means impropriety thus undue secrecy not only is undemocratic denying the public its right to know but also schools scandal by concealing and protecting errors excesses and all manner of impropriety and we have a presidency that seeks to control if not suppresseverything political pollster john zogby tells us that democrats are from venus and republicans are from mars and based on my examination of the bush ii white house vis224vis his predecessor im inclined to agree in shortnothing suggesting a sex scandal blipped on my screen on the other hand the potential for a serious financial andor power scandal as i discovered is quite real in additionthere is another state of affairs with the bush cheney presidency that is worse than any scandal and far worse than watergate in general tommy frankss first interview as a civilian shortly after he departed as fourstar head of central command when discussing what he thought americans should be thinking about concerning terrorism he asked rhetorically what is the worst thing that can happen his answer is chilling franks has no doubt whatsoever that upon obtaining a weapon of mass destructiona terrorist organization will use it if that should happenfranks believes the western world may lose what it cherishes mostand that is freedom and liberty weve seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy he has reached that conclusion because he feels that there exists the potential of amassive casualtyproducing event somewhere in the western world151it may be in the united states of america151that causes our population to question our own constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass casualtyproducing event which in fact then begins to unravel the fabric of our constitution i agree with general franks but i suspect for very different reasons watching the responses of bush and cheney to 911 their obsessive secrecy their endless political manipulation and exploitation of 911 their blatant suppression of rights and liberties of foreigners their taking our nation to its first preventive war as aggressors in iraq their distortion of intelligence gathering their nixonlike rationalizations i realized that151 with the near certainty of a catastrophic terrorist attack against america one day151we have the wrong leaders not because they are not able or well motivated or real americans as president lyndon johnson used to say151for they are all those things but they are also zealots who are convinced of their own wisdom oblivious to not only what americans think but the opinions of the entire world former supreme court justice louis brandeis once spoke of this problem the greatest danger to liberty lurks in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal wellmeaning but without understanding if the dreaded event that general franks has raised occurs and as i explain this presidency may actually attract such an event there is good reason to fear for the fabric of our constitution it goes without saying that it would be best to have neither a scandal nor something far worsethere is however only one antidote an end to the obsessiveunjustifiedand disproportionate secrecy that defines the bushcheney white house in addressing these matters i seek only to make the prima facie case to show that these potential problems are very real not fanciful concerns and should not be ignored in thinking about how best to set forth the disquieting circumstances i selected the only form of discourse that seems fitting a polemic polemic comes from the greek word polemikos151of or relating to war that of courseis the current situation by tradition polemics are firstperson strongly felt and relatively brief though polemics often indict those that simply trash are worthless whether one accepts or rejects his argumentan example of a classic polemic is christopher hitchenss the case against henry kissinger hitchenss case is powerfully presented compellingly and closely argued and ardent without being strident or unduly nasty on the other hand peggy noonans polemic the case against hillary clinton provided me with a perfect model of what i did not want to do invent facts appeal to emotions rather than intelligence engage in vicious namecallingand fail to provide documentation hitchenss work must be taken seriously whereas noonans effort is easily dismissed by way of preface i must add that i do not believe in conspiracy theories i use terms such as shadow national security council secret government and hidden agenda because they are descriptive of actual facts not theory in addition i have provided detailed documentation as chapter notes along with occasional footnotesnot only to show where information was found but to provide access to it for othersas noted in the acknowledgments i have talked or exchanged emailswith a lot of people while working on this project and many wished to remain offtherecord for reasons i understand and explain i decided to make virtually all these sources offtherecord because they were not necessary to state my case so only in rare instances have i quoted from any of these sourcesand never for any point of particular significance rather this information was used as leads confirmation insights about bush or cheney and background about their secretive ways or to find answers to the myriad questions that arise with such widespread secrecy in the chapters that follow i begin where this inquiry started with my discovery of the surprising nixonlike traits of george w bush when looking at him closely though i noted the earlywarning signs of the undue bushcheney secrecy what at first appeared only a penchant for secrecy i soon realized was a policy of concealment that they exercised throughout the 2000 campaign ive used examples of their campaign stonewalling because they have morphed into white house stonewalling once ensconced in their offices at 1600 pennsylvania avenue they quietly closed their doors pulled the shades and began making themselves increasingly inaccessible to the media and congress while demanding complete control over government information government under a virtual gag order became their standard operating procedure in looking at the bushcheney white house i found it not unlike nixons in that it spends far more time crafting the presidents public image and working on the politics of reelection than on truly addressing the business of the american people but what clearly distinguishes this presidency is its vice president a secretive man by nature whose unmatched power is largely veiled but whose secret governmental operations have changed the world151and not for the better dick cheney effectively a copresident incognito works behind closed doors and does not answer to congress or the public his partner the president is not sufficiently knowledgeable about their policies to answer questions about them adequately if and when he does occasionally make himself available it is not that he is stupid only ignorant151and apparently by design yet time and again their principal public policies151both foreign and domestic151 are laden with hidden agendas the bushcheney hidden agenda i have focused on relates to their national security policies given their critical importance equally worthy of attention is their hidden agenda to end federal entitlement programs by running up budgetbusting deficits while hiking military spending which is bleeding the federal treasury and will ultimately result in there simply being no money available to pay for social programs after this administration is gone these of course are programs151such as social security and medicare151that they dare not eliminate but economic and fiscal policy is not my fortes o rather than merely repeating the conclusions of others whose judgment i respect i have stayed with matters that i fully understand i have made no effort to write a history of all their sorry activities instead i have merely drafted a bill of particulars setting forth a sampling of their secrecy indicative of their policies and practices that demand the publics attention this material found in chapters two to five provides overwhelming evidence that their secrecy is out of hand and that it has become so pervasive and troubling that it must be called sinister for it has dreadful potential consequences for all americans perhaps as one historian mentioned to me the best model for a polemic is thomas paines common sense after all paines tract blasted a monarchy headed by a fellow named georgeand he called it as he saw it both paines undertakings are certainly compatible with my intentions first by calling attention to the surprisingly nixonian nature of the bush presidency then by proceeding through a number of particularly disquieting instances of the bushcheney secrecy151not a complete catalog but more than sufficient to establish their mentality151which started with the 2000 campaignprogressed at the white house and has resulted in the most abusive use of secrecy in the modern presidency my hope along the way is not to scandalmonger but rather to spray as much antiscandal disinfectant151called light151as i possibly can and my goal is to raise several important if not critical issues now being hidden from the public and place them on top of the table of public discussion particularly matters like those raised by general tommy franks that could end this grand experiment that we call democracy in short my plea is really for a little common sense
