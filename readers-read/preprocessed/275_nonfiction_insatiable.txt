 the fried egg and i elvis presley was coming to town to do two shows at olympia stadium at twentyone i was one of the hormoneraging millions with a crush on elvisthe young beautiful seemingly unspoiled elvis he was the badboy adonis of high school who drove the principal or in his case ed sullivan wild with the swivel and grind that made nymphets squeal and i was not immune no new york newspaper would hire me fresh from college in 1956i had applied everywhere and sent countless rsumsso i was languishing at home in detroit michigan the most junior staffer at united press international i wrote a letter to colonel parker asking if i could spend the day with elvis and write about it for the powerful wire service upi i got back a mimeographed invitation to presleys official press conference i was insulted and frustrated but not discouragedthe bureau chief said i could cover elvis anyway as long as it was on my day off i wore a simple bodyskimming black shantung dress my most slenderizing with white stitching along the neck and cap sleeves shiny black patentleather pumps and little white kid gloves i knew olympia stadium from childhood from barnum bailey circus days from falling in love with hockey and gordie howe in my uncles red wing hockey seats from seeing sonja henieso dolllikeand thinking i could skate too if i werent quite so tall and clumsy but would anyone ever be able to lift me i arrived backstage early to study security and find its most vulnerable link lamar was his name he was in charge of guarding the door and a pair of twentyfourkaratgold pants with a sequined stripe which he carried in a padlocked garment bag not for nothing had i spent all those doublebill saturdays in the movies i had ida lupino and joan crawford down pat i could do bette davis eyes i squared my shoulders channeling roz russell in the front page and flirted with the chubby guardian from his rolling drawl i figured he must be one of elviss memphis mafia do you sing too i asked tickling his tweed elbow lamar was examining my ring finger through the white leather and seemed cheered to confirm that i was not married at that moment a slim figure in a red suede cloth jacket was slipped into the room by a phalanx of uniformed security guards elvis curled his lip smiled and flicked back his shiny black cowlick with a toss of his head then seated himself on the edge of a table sizing up the gathering with an im all yours wink he was looking right at me i felt weak and i blushed all over the massed journaliststwo police reporters one yawning rewrite man a drama critic and a farmnews columnist few newspapers had popmusic columnists at the timestruggled to meet the challenge i was too feverish to speak i just stood there pulse pounding mesmerized wondering if my heart could survive it then after gamely responding to their lame and predictable queries too quickly elvis was gone lamar took my hand if you want to stand close by you can watch the show from the nearest aisle and slip back here before the crush at the end then you can go to the hotel with us to hang out and have a coke between shows he offered i stood on the rise of the aisle trying for a journalists cool part of me observing the hysteria part of me trembling and aching to jump up and down too i watched the fans mostly teenage girls with bobbing ponytails leaping out of the seats reaching out to him screaming and weeping tearing at their hair as he curled a lip or a hip collapsing in petit mal seizures his handlers had to carry elvis offstage midway through the last song to get him out alive before the mob realized that it was over and charged after their idol lamar grabbed my handstill sheathed in its little white glove and the bag containing the twentyfourkaratgold pants and tucked me into a limo with an assortment of silent young louts the full memphis crewwe pulled out of the underground bay but where is elvis i cried hes behind us in a taxi lamar promised at the bookcadillac hotel there were coagula of fans waiting to catch a glimpse of elvisas we piled out of the limo they surged toward us and then drew back with shrugs of disappointment and rejection upstairs in a twentyfourthfloor suite the memphis cronies sipped their colain those days coke was something that came in a bottle with a waistlinethey divvied up the comics from the sunday papers lamar seemed resigned to my indifference as if maybe hed been through this drill before nobody looked at me i was too familiar an offering for the king oh dear heaven i stopped breathing elvis he stood in the door smaller than lifesmall in life i mean pompadored hair slick he sized up the room and astutely realized i was the only female in it he slunk directly toward me slender in shiny black faille trousers and a sheer blue shortsleeved eyelet organdy shirt till one leg was brushing my thigh and who are you i babbled something about press and upi and colonel parker he didnt seem to be listening silently he took my handyes still glovedand led me to a bedroom i was thinking oh my god this is elvis i am going to do it with elvis i am not going to be coy i will not make him talk me into it he didnt ask i didnt answer he closed the door dropped his pants and lay on the bedvery pale soft youngwatching me take off my clothes and yes at lastmy little white gloves all the way up on the twentyfourth floor i could hear the girls chanting on the street below we want elviswe want elvis and look who has him i was thinkingas it happened in a feverish heat skin on skin i think it was good i dont remember the essential details it was certainly good enough i know the reality of it was thrilling beyond anything i might have imagined i need to sleep now he said when it was over i grabbed my clothes and fled into the bathroom to dress as i picked up my purse wondering if a goodbye kiss would be appropriate elvis opened his eyes blinked as if he wasnt sure for a moment what i was doing there he twitched a shoulder toward the phone would you mind calling room service and ordering me a fried egg sandwich the fried egg sandwichthat part i remember i cant remember how big it was how long the sex lasted or even who was on top probably me but i have never forgotten the fried egg sandwich yes the totemic fried egg sandwich at that moment it might have been clear i was born to be a restaurant critic i just didnt know it yet
