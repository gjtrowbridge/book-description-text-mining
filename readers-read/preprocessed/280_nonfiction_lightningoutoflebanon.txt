 8220you8217ve got to be taught 8221 you8217ve got to be taught before before you are six or seven or eight 8212rodgers and hammerstein lyrics from south pacific mohammed ghandour is a child of lebanon born into the desperately poor slums of south beirut packed with palestinian refugees and shiite muslim migrants from the south the area is called the 8220belt of misery8221 but when mohammed was four years old his bedtime routine was like that of millions of kids in the comfortably affluent suburbs of the united states mohammed took out the same video every evening and after he put the cassette into the video player he called his baby sister to join him the two children sat side by side before the television every evening and watched a story that soon enough was not only familiar but thoroughly ingrained in their young minds what parent8217s heart wouldn8217t be touched by this image of tender childhood who would not want to reach into this charming picture tousle the moppets8217 hair and pull them close for a kiss but mohammed and his sister weren8217t watching visual lollipops served up by the likes of barney the teletubbies or baby einstein they weren8217t learning the joys of playground toysharing the mysteries of counting or the thrills of reading in the flickering blue light of the tiny television in a small room deep in the winding alleys of a fetid slum mohammed and his baby sister watched a suicide bombing a real suicide bombing8212a fiveminute film of mohammed8217s father salah ghandour ramming a car stuffed with 990 pounds of explosives into an israeli convoy in south lebanon 8220there8217s my daddy8221 mohammed proudly exclaimed to a visitor at the climactic moment when the image of the crudely produced film flashed into the rolling orange and black ball of a terrible explosion that massive blast ripped mohammed8217s father to shreds and killed a dozen israeli soldiers1 8220there8217s my daddy8221 what seems horrible to western sensibilities is not only glorified as the holiest of acts within radical islam but is taught to children with the same facility and intensity that mtv teaches american kids the latest music and language trends in a thousand ways every day children like young mohammed are taught that the suicide bomber not only offers selfsacrifice in the service of an excruciatingly grim god but an express ticket to the highest rewards of heaven public processions at the funerals of islamic terrorists and the demonstration marches of radical islamic groups feature children carrying ak47 rifles and wearing belts of fake explosives8212belts just like those worn by real suicide bombers not much older than they nothing more sharply defines the vast chasm between islamic extremism and the west their different views of the value of life itself than these poignant images of children playing at martyrdom salah ghandour8217s selfimmolation was an act of terrorism committed8212and recorded in progress for a sophisticated program of media and propaganda use8212by an organization that terrorism experts call the 8220ateam8221 of international terrorism hezbollah the 8220party of god8221 founded in 1982 with the help of ayatollah khomeini8217s islamic revolutionary guard irg headquartered in lebanon closely allied with and supported by iran hezbollah held the record for terrorist murders of americans before al qaeda seized that grisly distinction with the catastrophic events of september 11 2001 hezbollah constituted as a political party in lebanon is known to have warm links with al qaeda according to the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 8220911 commission report8221 issued in july 2004 8220al qaeda members received advice and training from hezbollah8221 this statement confirms information documented elsewhere in this book the 911 commission report also describes the contacts of senior hezbollah members with the hijackers who attacked the united states on september 11 2001 and advises that 8220this topic requires further investigation by the us government8221 hezbollah still holds the record for terrorist killings of us military personnel8212the murder of 241 us marines sailors and soldiers when a 12000pound hezbollah truck bomb leveled their barracks in beirut on october 23 1983 it is operating in iraq just as henry ford did not invent the automobile but made it a massproduced fact of modern life so hezbollah did not invent the suicide car bomb but hezbollah ruthlessly elevated this horrifically indiscriminate device into the first choice of weapons in the sinister toolbox of middle eastern terrorism largescale suicide bombing often coordinated in multiple attacks is a hezbollah trademark some counterterrorism experts believe that a man named imad mugniyah8212hezbollah8217s operations chief wanted by the united states8212taught this concept of rolling destruction to osama bin laden in 1994 seven years before the al qaeda attacks of september 11 2001 sanctioned suicide pioneered by hezbollah has made mass murder by explosive numbingly routine not only in the middle east but around the world hezbollah is neither a remote curio of lebanon nor an organization whose activity is limited to the middle east the party of god has intertwined itself like a noxious vine around the vast lebanese diaspora a worldwide expatriate community of traders and merchants silently deliberately and all but invisibly its cohorts have infiltrated the united states and its neighbors canada and latin america hezbollah is here now hezbollah cadres are known to have been planted in at least fourteen cities in the united states places as unlikely as houston texas louisville kentucky and charlotte north carolina its american cells are led by dedicated coldly calculating men who grew up on the same stark diet of fanatical hatred of the west that is fed daily to millions of children like young mohammed ghandour carefully8212but sometimes audaciously a measure of their contempt for us law enforcement authorities8212hezbollah8217s operatives have woven themselves into the american tapestry these hidden agents of hatred have taken advantage of america8217s cultural openness and exploited our civil liberties to raise funds and acquire military equipment illegally shipped abroad to support hezbollah8217s war of terror against the west they have engaged in military training and raised millions of illicit dollars through a ruthless catalog of criminal enterprises including largescale cigarette smuggling and tax evasion schemes credit card fraud drug running gun trafficking internet pornography and an array of other criminal schemes lying effortlessly and continuously they have cynically duped ordinary americans into unknowingly aiding their terror operations often by appealing to simple greed and a willingness to dismiss lowlevel criminal acts as 8220not really that bad8221 most ominously hezbollah8217s minions lurk in sleeper cells willing able and waiting only for the command of their masters in beirut and tehran to commit acts of violent terror on american soil no one who understands hezbollah8217s history doubts for a second its ability to inflict horrible damage should it choose to do so according to fbi officials serious credence was given to fears of a hezbollah plot to assassinate president clinton8217s national security adviser anthony tony lake in 1995 there was enough concern to have lake move out of his home into the more secure quarters of blair house the nation8217s official guest residence opposite the white house the threat is not theoretical hezbollah8217s dark talents have been gruesomely demonstrated in the western hemisphere by sophisticated bombing attacks in argentina hezbollah sleeper cells8212constituted much like those in the united states8212are known to exist in an area of south america known as the triborder region of brazil argentina and paraguay these cells cooperated with the iranian secret service to carry out two horrific signature bombings in argentina on march 17 1992 the israeli embassy in buenos aires was struck by a suicide bomber killing 29 and on july 18 1994 another powerful bomb destroyed the main building of the argentine israelite mutual aid association amia on a busy street in downtown buenos aires that bomb killed 86 and wounded 300 the greatest loss of jewish life in a terrorist incident outside israel since the second world war a senior staff member of a committee of the us congress regards the argentine bombings as in part a notsosubtle hezbollah signal to the united states 8220the message is8221 he said 8220we did it there we can do it here8221 just as distant thunder warns of the fury of a coming storm the presence of these hezbollah cells in america warns of a frightening potential from a body of killers said by one american intelligence expert to make osama bin laden8217s al qaeda 8220look like a bunch of kindergartners8221 fortunately a small band of extremely talented men and women from the ranks of local and federal law enforcement together with a team of equally talented prosecutors have dedicated much of their lives to rooting out hezbollah8217s weeds in america the almost serendipitous coming together of a handful of these able men and women exposed and successfully prosecuted one major hezbollah cell in the most unlikely of places8212charlotte north carolina they continue working to unravel a tangle of other cells rooted deeply in other unsuspecting american communities this is the story of hezbollah8217s invasion of america and of the thin line of defense upon which american lives depend it describes in microcosm virtually all of the issues raised by and investigated by the 911 commission8212with one major difference these extraordinary men and women overcame the obstacles that blinded america to the coming attack by al qaeda and succeeded in exposing hezbollah8217s operations but one part of this story cannot be told because it remains unknown8212and that is whether even more hidden layers of hezbollah8217s dark enterprise lie undetected coiled to strike in america the bourj albarajneh neighborhood lies about ten miles to the southeast of downtown beirut not far from the headquarters of hezbollah what strikes many visitors first is the pervasive stench from the vast heap of an open garbage dump swarming with dark clouds of flies at the entrance of an eponymous refugee camp for palestinians the bourj albarajneh refugee camp established after the creation of israel and the partition of palestine in 1947821148 blends into the surrounding lebanese neighborhoods its borders are indistinguishable to the visitor although palestinians and lebanese know precisely where the boundaries lie in any case the camp and the surrounding neighborhoods are grindingly poor warrens labyrinths of narrow paths barely deserving to be called alleys rank with open sewers and the acrid smell of stale urine littered with garbage spiderwebbed with makeshift electrical connections drunken with bootleg utility piping and above all dark with despair the encamped palestinians have been virtually ignored by arab governments for more than fifty years with the exception of the occasional trotting out of refugee misery for purposes of international incitement their children are regularly rallied to dance and cheer upon news of the latest suicide bombing in israel the other residents of bourj albarajneh packed cheek by jowl with the palestinians are poor shiite muslims 233migr233s from lebanon8217s rural south the shiites are a minority muslim denomination that broke off from the majority sunni faithful in the seventh century persecuted ever since as a heretical sect shiites however are the majority in iran they are also strongly represented in iraq where they were viciously suppressed by its erstwhile dictator saddam hussein and remain ungratefully and violently rebellious in the wake of the american invasion of iraq in 2003 in lebanon most shiites were farmers living for centuries in numbing medieval rural servitude in the south desperately poor badly organized and longsuffering under the dominant sunnis8212islam8217s majority wing8212the shiites in lebanon were traditionally friendly with israel lebanon8217s southern neighbor during the 1970s some shiites even fought alongside israeli soldiers against the palestinian liberation organization plo as members of the israelibacked south lebanon army sla the shiites began immigrating to the city8217s suburbs in the 1970s under pressure from the successive invasions of yasser arafat8217s plo8212expelled from jordan in 19708212and an israeli army determined in 1982 to eradicate the plo after suffering a decade of crossborder terrorist raids and rocket attacks mounted by the plo from lebanon the israelis8217 heavyhanded treatment of the shiites played into the agenda of israel8217s radical islamic foes the occupation of the south soon destroyed the earlier amicable relations and turned lebanon8217s shiites into implacable enemies israeli officers and soldiers who once motored leisurely home through south lebanon on weekend passes found themselves the targets of shiite ambushes and suicide attacks like that committed by salah ghandour and enshrined by his son like many such centers of ruraltourban emigration in less developed parts of the world bourj albarajneh became a hellhole of futility its residents trapped in endless poverty the victims of and participants in rolling waves of violence over the beginnings and ends of which they had no control the chronic cancer of despair thrived the male children born into these hopeless streets quickly became willing grist for the mills of an array of armed militias that succeeded one another in archaeological layers of violence the violent process culminated with the hezbollah terror machine controlling the area mohammed youssef hammoud came kicking and screaming into the pitiless world of bourj albarajneh on september 25 1973 the hammoud family was devoutly religious one to whom shiite clerics and saints and some lay leaders were figures of reverent authority the hand of centuries of islam and shiite doctrinal history touched the infant mohammed at his birth like many such families the hammoud family grew large beyond the means of its poverty mohammed hammoud was one of five brothers and seven sisters in addition to the ties of his immediate family young mohammed was born into the intense bonds of a network of clan and extended family the physical and social closeness of bourj albarajneh creates a world in which one8217s business is at once both no one8217s and everyone8217s cousins and close friends would turn up time and again in mohammed8217s life far from lebanon the tumult of the larger middle east conflict marked every milestone in mohammed8217s young life on october 6 1973 scarcely two weeks after his birth syria and egypt struck israel in a surprise attack on yom kippur the holiest day of the jewish religious calendar only emergency aid from the united states saved israel from a military setback that could have threatened the jewish state8217s existence discussion of the war its impact and america8217s role burned hotly through bourj albarajneh as it did everywhere on the 8220arab street8221 in the united states however ordinary americans were more focused on relief over the end of the vietnam war8212the paris peace accords had been signed only in january8212and frustration over the impact of an oil embargo that the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec imposed on the west in retaliation for aid to israel the arab embargo set off a recession and the price of gasoline soared in america from 30 cents a gallon to about 120 in the worst days those events generated a brief flurry of crudely stereotypical ethnic attacks on the arabs but the subtleties of the longer term implications of the arab8211israeli struggle simply failed to interest most americans
