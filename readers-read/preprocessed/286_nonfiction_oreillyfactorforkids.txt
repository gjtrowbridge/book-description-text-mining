 friends almost everybody watched the tv show friends on nbc unfortunately some kids think thats what real friends are like of course we can learn a lot of things from our friends on television but sitcoms are very different from real life in real life true friends stand by you when things get rough if you get sick or have a tragedy in your family your real friends will be there to listen and to help sure they do that in the tv program but the tragedies those characters experience last only twentythree minutes yours will last much longer so your friends will have to last much longer too tv friends are also always fooling around you cant do that in real life there will be times when you will have to do some very difficult things if you have friends who will help you youll be a lot better off my story i once had a friend in high school whom i confided in this guy and i had known each other since first grade and we were pretty solid at least i thought we were freshman year is always tough because you are the youngest in the school and are still trying to figure out the program there was this dance i wanted to go to but i didnt want to go alone i wanted some guys to hang with so the girls would think i was cool so i asked my friend who was usually up for this kind of thing if he would come along he said he couldnt go i said fine and found a couple of other guys to go with me but when we arrived at the hop thats what they called a dance back then i couldnt believe my eyes my socalled friend who told me he couldnt go to the dance was out there doing the twist like a madman what was up with that i cornered this socalled friend later and he admitted that some of the guys he went to the dance with didnt like me so he didnt want me around if that situation had happened in a tv sitcom everybody would have made up and had a few laughs but life is different i never trusted that guy again and rarely spoke to him since he never apologized i think i made the smart decision he wasnt a true friend and that happens a lot in life by not wasting any more time with him i went on to make real friends many of whom i hang around with to this day im that kind of guy once i become friends with you im in for life unless you do something bad to me even though i am now famous and successful i still keep my old friends and believe me none of them looks like jennifer aniston it would not be hard being her friend okay you know ive made money it was a long time coming so i dont usually spend much of it and i certainly dont show it off were going to talk about money smarts later in this book but one thing i do that costs a few bucks is set up a trip every year to some exotic faraway place the caribbean the hawaiian islands where i sail and swim and dive with old friends and i do mean old friends ive known some of these guys since we were four years old others from high school and college and still others from my early years in television ive been lucky to have such friends but ive also worked hard at it we trust one another we care about one anothers families we laugh a lot we remember a lot i hope you can have such friends when youre my age of course you cant control all of the circumstances that help friendships develop and last i grew up in the same house until i went away to college the kids in my neighborhood really knew one another we went to the same schools terrorized the same teachers dated the same girls now i dont want you to think that i sat around when i was your age and carefully chose my companions because of their virtues no way i ran with the loudmouthed brash unruly kids we looked like bums we acted like maniacs we did very stupid things but even though we would not have used these words back then we were loyal to one another one for all all for one we really were like that and because i had experienced true friendship which grew over the years through many different situations not all of them fun by any means i got very very spoiled i mean throughout the rest of my life i have expected new friends to be as honest and loyal as my old friends is that stupid maybe but thats the way i am other people will tell you to forgive a friend for lying to you not me others will say that it is mature to expect your friends to have faults agreed they can have all kinds of faults except dishonesty and disloyalty either of those is poison to a friendship sorry but i cant see it any other way someone can lie to me once but only once if he or she wants to be a friend see you heard i could be stubborn and i want you to be the same way at least on this subject you deserve friendship with people who can be trusted you dont need to accept a socalled friendship with someone because he or she is popular or goodlooking none of that matters i am surrounded in television by people who choose friends because theyre rich or famous or sexy that kind of friendship is called groveling and it lasts such as it is only as long as the other person has money gets recognized on the street or looks good in lowriders
