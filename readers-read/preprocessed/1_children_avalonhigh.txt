trust my best friend nancy to see things that way nancy is what you would call an optimist not that im a pessimist or anything im just practical at least according to nancy apparently im also lucky lucky i echoed into the phone in what way am i lucky oh you know nancy said you get to start over in a whole new school where no one knows you you can be whoever you want to be you can give yourself a total personality makeover and there wont be anyone around to be all who do you think youre kidding ellie harrison i remember when you ate paste in first grade i never thought of it that way i said because i hadnt anyway you were the one who ate paste you know what i mean nancy sighed well good luck with school and everything yeah i said sensing even over the thousandmile difference between us that it was time to hang up bye bye nancy said then added youre so lucky really up until nancy said this i hadnt thought there was anything lucky about my situation at all except maybe the fact that theres a pool in the backyard of our new house we never had a pool of our own before if nancy and i wanted to go to the pool we had to get on our bikes and ride five miles mostly uphill to como park i have to say when my parents broke the news about the sabbatical the fact that they were quick to add and were renting a house with a pool was the only thing that kept down the vomit that started coming up in my throat if you are a child of professors sabbatical is probably about the dirtiest word in your own personal vocabulary every seven years most professors get offered one basically a yearlong vacation so they can recharge and try to write and publish a book professors love sabbaticals their kids hate them because would you really want to uproot and leave all your friends make all new friends at a whole new school and just be getting to think okay this isnt so bad only to have to uproot yourself again a year later and go back where you came from no not if youre sane anyway at least this sabbatical isnt as bad as the last one which was in germany not that theres anything wrong with germany i still exchange emails with annekatrin the girl i shared a desk with in the weird german school i went to there but come on i had to learn a whole other language at least with this one were still in america and okay were outside washington dc which isnt like the rest of america but everyone here speaks english so far and theres a pool having your own pool is a lot of responsibility it turns out i mean every morning you have to check the filters and make sure they arent all jammed up with leaves or dead moles theres almost always a frog or two in ours usually if i get out there early enough theyre still alive so then i have to conduct a frog rescue expedition the only way you can rescue the frogs is to reach down into the water to pull the filter basket out so ive ended up touching all sorts of really gross stuff that floats in there like dead beetles and newts and a few times drowned mice once there was a snake it was still alive i pretty much draw the line at touching anything that is capable of sending paralyzing streams of poison into my veins so i yelled to my parents that there was a snake in the filter basket my dad is the one who yelled back so what do you want me to do about it get it out i said no way my dad said im not touching any snake my parents arent like other parents for one thing other peoples parents actually leave the house to go to work some of them are gone for as many as fortyfive hours a week ive heard not mine mine are home all the time they never leave theyre always in their athome offices writing or reading practically the only time they come out of their offices is to watch jeopardy and then they yell out the answers at each other no one elses parents know all the answers to jeopardy or yell them out if they do i know ive been to nancys house and seen the evidence for myself her parents watch entertainment tonight after dinner like normal people i dont know any of the answers on jeopardy thats why i sort of hate that show my dad grew up in the bronx where there arent any snakes he completely hates nature he totally ignores our cat tig which of course means that tig is crazy about him and if my dad sees a spider he screams like a girl then my mom who grew up on a ranch in montana and has no patience for spiders or my dads screaming will come in and kill it even though ive told her a million times that spiders are extremely beneficial to the environment of course i knew better than to tell my mom about the snake in the pool filter because shed probably have come out and snapped its head clean off right in front of me in the end i found a forked branch and pulled it out that way i let it go in the woodsy area behind the house were renting even though the snake didnt turn out to be that scary once i finally got the guts to save it i kind of hope it doesnt come back
