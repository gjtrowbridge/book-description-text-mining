 chapter one tsunami washed away small waves one after the other lap the shore two sri lankan villagers walk along the waters edge searching for bodies washed up by the tide they come every morning leave without answers some days they find nothing today theres a torn shoe and a piece of broken fence im standing in a pile of rubble beneath me the ground seems to move twisting and turning in on itself it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust the ground isnt moving at all its maggots thousands of them writhing squirming they feast on some unseen flesh nearby a dog with lowhanging teats and a face smeared with blood scavenges for scraps she steps carefully among scattered bricks tourist snapshots china plates the flotsam and jetsam of life before the wave it took centuries for the pressure to build subtle shifts grinding force long ago a thousand miles east of sri lanka more than fifteen miles below the surface of the indian ocean two gigantic shelves of rock tectonic plates pressed against each other the rim of what scientists call the india plate began to push underneath the burma plate something had to give at nearly one minute before 800 am the morning after christmas 2004 the force of the compression explodes along a section of rock some one hundred miles off the west coast of sumatra a fault line more than seven hundred miles long violently rips open and a shelf of rock and sediment thrusts upward fifty feet unleashing an explosion of energy so powerful it alters the rotation of the earth it is one of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history shock waves pulse in all directions displacing millions of tons of water creating giant undersea waves a tsunami a ship on the surface of the sea would barely have noticed detecting perhaps some slight swells no more than two feet high but underneath out of sight churning walls of water extend from the oceans bottom to the surface pushing outward the water moves fast five hundred miles per hour the speed of a commercial jetliner it takes eight minutes after the earthquake begins for the sonic signals to reach the pacific tsunami warning center in hawaii the thin needle of a seismograph suddenly springs to life rapidly scribbling side to side signaling an alarm its already too late eight minutes later at approximately 815 am in banda aceh sumatra the first of several massive walls of water explodes onto shore in the next two hours tsunami waves strike ten other countries more than two hundred thousand people will die in new york 2005 begins in a blizzard a hurricane of confetti and light at the stroke of midnight im standing on a platform in the center of times square im about sixty feet off the ground and below on the streets all around me are people hundreds of thousands of revelers packed shoulder to shoulder behind barricades set up by police the crowd is cheering i see their mouths are open their hands waving in the air but i cant hear them both my ears are plugged with wireless headphones connecting me to a control room several blocks away i hear only the hiss of the satellite transmission and a thin pulse of blood throbbing in my ears its a strange way to start 2005 weve been covering the tsunami around the clock this week and each day brings new details new horrors theres been talk of canceling the celebrations but in the end its decided that the show will go on ive always hated new years eve when i was ten i lay on the floor of my room with my brother watching on tv as the crowd in times square counted down the remaining seconds of 1977 my father was in the intensive care unit at new york hospital hed had a series of heart attacks and in a few days would undergo bypass surgery my brother and i were terrified but too scared to speak with each other about it we watched silent numb as the giant crystal ball made its slow descent it all seemed so frightening the screaming crowds the frigid air not knowing if our father would live through the new year i grew up in new york but never went to see the ball drop until i volunteered to cover it for cnn for most new yorkers the idea of going anywhere near times square on new years eve is inconceivable its like eating at tavern on the green the food may be tasty but its best left to outoftowners ive always thought that new years eve is proof that human beings are essentially optimistic creatures despite hundreds of years of pathetic parties and hellish hangovers we continue to cling to the notion that its possible to have fun on that night its not theres too much pressure too many expectations too few bathrooms the truth is i began volunteering to work on new years eve as a way to avoid having to do something social this is my second time covering the times square festivities and ive actually begun to enjoy it there arent many opportunities in this city to feel part of a community we scuttle about the streets each day individual atoms occasionally running into one another but rarely coalescing to form a whole in times square however as the ball descends and the crowd cheers new york becomes a very different place a place of pure feeling when midnight arrives the air explodes into a solid mass a swirl of colored confetti that seems to hang suspended in space for several minutes i am not expected to say anything the pictures take over the cameras pan the streets wide shots and closeups people sing and shout i take the headphones out of my ears and am surrounded by the waves of sound the air seems to shake and for
