 the mother of all advice trust in god and be true to yourself 8211mary trump my mother when i look back that was great advice concise and wise at once i didn8217t really get it at first but because it sounded good i stuck to it later i realized how comprehensive this is8211 how to keep your bases covered while thinking about the big picture it8217s good advice no matter what your business or lifestyle 8211djt a lot has happened to us all since 1987 that8217s the year the art of the deal was published and became the bestselling business book of the decade with over three million copies in print business rule 1 if you don8217t tell people about your success they probably won8217t know about it a few months ago i picked up the art of the deal skimmed a bit and then read the first and last paragraphs i realized that after seventeen years they still rang true i could have written these words yesterday first paragraph i don8217t do it for the money i8217ve got enough much more than i8217ll ever need i do it to do it deals are my art form other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry i like making deals preferably big deals that8217s how i get my kicks last paragraph don8217t get me wrong i also plan to keep making deals big deals and right around the clock it8217s now 2004 i8217m still making deals around the clock and i still don8217t do it for the money i don8217t think you should do it for the money either money is not an end in itself but it8217s sometimes the most effective way to help us realize our dreams so if you8217ve got big dreams and you8217re looking for a way to make them happen this book is for you introduction five billion reasons why you should read this book how to get rich that8217s what i decided to call it because whenever i meet people that8217s usually what they want to know from me you ask a baker how he makes bread you ask a billionaire how he makes money sure there have been countless howtogetrich books written by millionaires billionaire authors are harder to find billionaire authors with interests in real estate gaming sports and entertainment are rarer still and billionaire authors with their own manhattan skyscrapers and hit primetime tv series are the rarest of all i8217m pretty sure i8217m the only one though oprah could give me a run for the money if she ever decides to write another book and get into real estate business rule 2 keep it short fast and direct the following pages will be straightforward and succinct but don8217t let the brevity of these passages prevent you from savoring the profundity of the advice you are about to receive these stories and words of wisdom have been distilled from almost thirty years at the top so here it comes the scoop from the donald after you make your first billion don8217t forget to send me a thankyou note you know the address part i the donald j trump school of business and management be a general i am the chairman and president of the trump organization i like saying that because it means a great deal to me there are almost twenty thousand members of this organization at this point i did a print ad once in which i declared 8220i only work with the best8221 that statement still stands more and more i see that running a business is like being a general calling the shots carries a great deal of responsibility not only for yourself but for your troops your employees8217 lives to a large extent are dependent on you and your decisions bad strategy can end up affecting a lot of people this is where being a leader takes on a new dimension every decision you make is an important one whether there are twenty thousand people working for you or just one if you are careful when finding employees management becomes a lot easier i rely on a few key people to keep me informed they know i trust them and they do their best to keep that trust intact for example when i need to know something about my casinos and hotels in atlantic city i know i can call up mark brown my ceo and get a fast and informed answer if i call laura cordovano over at trump park avenue and ask about sales she8217ll give it to me exactly as it is if i call allen weisselberg my cfo he8217ll tell me what i need to know in twenty words or less my senior counsel and apprentice adviser george ross can do it in ten words or less find people who suit your business style and you8217ll have fewer problems to deal with as time goes on good people equals good management and good management equals good people they have to work together or they won8217t work together for very long i8217ve seen good management get by with mediocre people and i8217ve also seen excellent people get stuck in the mires of bad management the good managers will eventually leave followed by the good workers and you will be left with a team that gets along because they8217re all mediocre save yourself time by getting the best people you can sometimes this can mean choosing attitude over experience and credentials use your creativity to come up with a good mix creative people rarely need to be motivated8211they have their own inner drive that refuses to be bored they refuse to be complacent they live on the edge which is precisely what is needed to be successful and remain successful one of my former employees was in charge of a new project he had done a thorough and acceptable job but i felt that something was missing it wasn8217t fantastic which knowing his capabilities it should have been i decided to challenge his creative ego by mentioning that it was fine but seemed to lack inspiration i politely asked him whether he was genuinely interested in the project and suggested that perhaps that might be the problem well the guy went ballistic on me he was deeply insulted and as you can probably guess the revision he turned in was terrific the difference between the first draft and the final version was incredible i didn8217t slam the guy because he was usually demanding of himself and had never let me down but i had to give him a jolt generals motivate their soldiers they inspire them when it is necessary they do the same for their highestranking officers we all need a boost now and then learn how to tailor your method to the personalities you are managing keep the big picture in mind while attending to the daily details this can seem like a balancing act but it is absolutely necessary for success in running a company in the 1980s i was riding high after learning the essentials of real estate development from my father fred a builder in queens and brooklyn i8217d become a major player in manhattan developing trump tower the grand hyatt hotel and many other toptier properties i had a yacht a plane a bestselling book one magazine headline said everything he touches turns to gold and i believed it i8217d never known adversity i went straight from wharton to wealth even in down markets i bought properties inexpensively and made a lot of money i began to think it was easy in the late eighties i lost focus i8217d fly off to europe to attend fashion shows and i wasn8217t looking at the clothing my lack of attention was killing my business then the real estate market crashed i owed billions upon billions of dollars821192 billion to be exact that8217s nine billion two hundred million dollars i8217ve told this story many times before but it bears repeating in the midst of the crash i passed a beggar on the street and realized he was worth 92 billion more than i was i saw a lot of my friends go bankrupt never to be heard from again stay focused the media had me for lunch forbes businessweek fortune the wall street journal the new york times8211 they all published major stories about my crisis and a lot of people seemed to be happy about it i8217ll never forget the worst moment it was 3 am citibank phoned me at my home in trump tower they wanted me to come over to their office immediately to negotiate new terms with some foreign banks8211three of the ninetynine banks to whom i owed billions it8217s tough when you have to tell a banker that you can8217t pay interest they tend not to like those words an ally at citibank suggested that the best way for me to handle this difficult situation was to call the banks myself and that8217s exactly what they wanted me to do at three o8217clock on a cold january morning in the freezing rain there were no cabs so i walked fifteen blocks to citibank by the time i got there i was drenched that was the low point there were thirty bankers sitting around a big table i phoned one japanese banker then an austrian banker and then a third banker from a country i can no longer remember in the art of the deal i had warned readers never to personally guarantee anything well i hadn8217t followed my own advice of the 92 billion i owed i8217d personally guaranteed a billion dollars i was a schmuck but i was a lucky schmuck and i wound up dealing with some understanding bankers who worked out a fair deal after being the king of the eighties i survived the early nineties and by the midtolate nineties i was thriving again but i learned my lesson i work as hard today as i did when i was a young developer in the 1970s don8217t make the mistake i did stay focused maintain your momentum william levitt the master builder of levittown taught me the true meaning of 8220momentum8221 in the 1950s he was the king no detail was too small for his attention he would personally collect stray nails and extra chips of wood from building sites to make sure his construction crews used all available materials he sold his company in 1956 to itt for 100 million which is equivalent to billions today then he made some terrible mistakes he retired he married the wrong woman he moved to the south of france and lived on the riviera with his new boat and his new wife one day itt called the executives in charge of the conglomerate had no aptitude for home building they had bought huge tracts of land but didn8217t know how to get them zoned so they sold it back to levitt who thought he8217d gotten a great deal he went back into business and he proceeded to go bankrupt i saw william levitt at a cocktail party in 1994 two weeks before he died he was standing by himself in a corner looking defeated i didn8217t know him well but i approached him hoping to acquire some wisdom from the master 8220mr levitt8221 i said 8220how are you doing8221 8220not good donald not good8221 then he said the words i8217ll never forget 8220i lost my momentum i was out of the world for twenty years i came back and i wasn8217t the same8221 no matter how accomplished you are no matter how well you think you know your business you have to remain vigilant about the details of your field you can8217t get by on experience or smarts even the best surgeons need to be retrained regularly to stay current on the latest research and procedures no matter what you8217re managing don8217t assume you can glide by momentum is something you have to work at to maintain get a great assistant surround yourself with people you can trust i often say it8217s good to be paranoid but not when it comes to your home team ask god for a great assistant no joke a great one can make your life a whole lot easier8211or in my case almost manageable norma foerderer has been with me for twentythree years if you want to know what a great guy i am just ask her but not on a friday handling me the office and several hundred calls a week isn8217t easy she8217s as tough and smart as she is gracious she8217s also indefatigable which helps a lot if you work for me my phones are so busy that i require two executive assistants and they never stop they alone handle on the average more than 1250 calls a week they are not only efficient and fast but also very pleasant and beautiful young women you don8217t have to be beautiful to work for me8211just be good at your job i8217ve been accused of admiring beautiful women i plead guilty but when it comes to the workplace anyone who is beautiful had better have brains too you need competent people with an inherent work ethic i8217m not a complacent person and i can8217t have a complacent staff i move forward quickly and so must they once i wanted to know how fast a new employee could work so i told him i was leaving in fifteen minutes and needed something done within that time i wasn8217t actually going anywhere but sure enough i had what i needed in fifteen minutes machiavellian maybe but both of us learned something that day one final piece of advice on assistants which i learned from experience and which i admit may not be as relevant to your career as it8217s been to mine find a receptionist who can speak english we had a breathtaking european beauty out front who could easily rival ingrid bergman in her heyday but i discovered that her ability to recognize wellknown people in the united states was limited to myself and maybe president bush she wasn8217t so familiar with the likes of hugh grant reggie jackson george steinbrenner jack welch paul anka mohamed al fayed regis philbin or tony bennett their calls never got through to me and their names were placed on her 8220psycho list8221 but you should have seen her what a knockout she8217s since moved on to better career opportunities but we8217ll never forget her neither will anyone who ever called in or tried to
