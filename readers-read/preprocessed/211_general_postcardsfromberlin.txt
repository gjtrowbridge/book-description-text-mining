 c h a p t e r 1 daisy hears them first the crunch of feet on the gravel the resonant clearing of throats outside our living room window she darts to the window tugs at the curtain theyre here she says she kneels on the sofa presses her face to the glass her warm breath mists the pane i turn off the light so the room is lit by the dancing red of the fire and go to stand beside her pulling the curtain open my head is close to hers i smell the musky sweetness of her hair sinead hangs back fiddling with her new velvet choker an early christmas present from her mother shes reached that age when enthusiasms have to be carefully concealed and anyway gangsta rap is really more her thing i glance at richard he folds his times and turns toward the window in the shadowed room and the flickering of the firelight i cant see if hes smiling look says daisy theyve got snowflakes on their eyelashes there are ten of them in the darkness by the steps to our front door theyre bundled in coats and scarves the everyday color leached from their clothes and faces by the torchlight their breath is thick there are siftings of snow on their shoulders they move around and shuffle into position nicky is there in a woolen hat that hides her crisp black hair with little reindeer dangling from her ears she looks up at daisy grins and blows her a kiss the earrings shiver the others have their eyes down theyre fumbling through their music books with clumsy wetgloved fingers there are women i recognize from daisys class at school kates mother natalies mother 151 women i know only by the names of their children 151 and men from the choir at the church round the corner and two or three teenagers the torches they carry suffuse their faces with red a myriad of little torches glimmer in their eyes next to nicky theres a man i dont recognize he has unruly fair hair a darkly gleaming leather jacket i can just make out his heavy eyebrows and the line of his jaw above them a nailparing moon shines briefly through the clouds nicky knows what this moon is supposed to mean shes been through feng shui and aromatherapy and her current passion is witchcraft 151 the kind of bland designer witchcraft you can read about in lavish books with pastel velour covers 151 and she says that the moons have names and this is the birch moon 151 the first moon of the year the moon of beginnings the snow began this morning with a perfect theatrical sense of timing in our garden theres a milky skin of ice on the pond and the dangling tendrils of forsythia are white knotted strands of wool and the stone frog fountain has a hat of snow we played snowballs sinead and daisy and me staying out far too long not realizing how chilled we were and when we finally came back into the warmth of the kitchen daisys fingers were red and shiny in spite of her gloves and she cried as the blood came back into them i told her they hurt because they were getting better warming up but it didnt help to know that she couldnt stop crying in the cold the foxes are getting bolder coming close to the house this afternoon i saw them on the patio looking in at the french doors then shying away mangy thin golden one with a paw that it couldnt touch to the ground quite silent yet leaving perfect footprints since then more snow has fallen blotting out the foxes footprints and our own so our back garden looks as though no one has ever been there if you went out there now you would feel a thing you rarely feel in london a sense of how high the sky is of the immensity of the night the singers clear their throats and start to sing their faces are lifted eager their breath like smoke i saw three ships come sailing in on christmas day on christmas day singing voices sound different outside fragile thinner half their resonance swallowed up by the air yet so precise and perfect i see the ships in my minds eye theyre like the ships in a toddlers picture book with rainbowpainted prows and many silken sails playful gaudy cresting the curled waves daisy gives a little sigh and rests her head against me sinead comes close sits on the arm of the sofa theyre both thoroughly irreverent 151 they have their own salacious parodies of carols picked up in the playground 151 yet theyre held stilled by the song the room smells of cinnamon and warm wine of the forest freshness of juniper of the apple cake that is cooling in the kitchen moist and sweet and crusted on top with sugar i want to hold this moment to make it last forever the scents and the singing and firelight and daisys head against me theres a long still moment after the end of the song like a held breath then daisy applauds extravagantly and i turn on the lights and hurry to the door and open it wide there are seven stone steps up to our door nicky comes first bounding up two at a time shes pink skinned eager eyed catriona 151 you look so good i kiss her her face is cold were we brilliant she asks you were wonderful she pulls off her hat shakes out her spiky hair wetness sprays from her the reindeer earrings dance she holds out the christian aid tin rattles it hopefully daisy puts in our money with a satisfactory clatter the others follow her noisily talking they are themselves again separate banal the braid of music that bound them together unwoven they shrug off their wet heavy clothes the powdering of snow on their hair is melting al ready they stretch out their arms and relish the warmth the house is suddenly full of sound of energy i bring the saucepan from the kitchen and dole the wine into tumblers daisy and sinead hand the glasses round carrying them like precious things holding them right at the top so as not to burn their fingers i see their heads as they weave their way through the crush sinead with hair thats dark and thick like her mothers pulled back in a ponytail and fastened with karma beads and daisy blond like me nicky passing whispers in my ear dyou like my new recruit she gestures rather obviously toward the man in the leather jacket i nod fergal oconnor hes a sweetie 151 bringing up his little boy on his own jamie goes to saint marks i think remind me to introduce you she moves off to talk to richard i chat for a while to kates mother and natalies mother they drink eagerly cradling the tumblers between their hands to warm them natalies mother looks greedily round the room nice house she says her teeth are already stained purple by the wine i shrug a little well were so lucky to live here ill say her fervor isnt quite polite they talk about their children about homework what a pain quite honestly you end up having to do it yourself and the 11 and how ghastly it is last year some girls were so nervous they puked up before they went in and whether eight is really too young for your child to have her first cell phone these themes are familiar i only half join in i look round the room feeling a warm sense of satisfaction seeing it through natalies mothers eyes recognizing what i have achieved here because any woman might look at it now in that greedy appraising way yet when richard and i first came here and walked between the stone dogs and up the seven steps and the woman from tarrants unlocked the door and ushered us in i felt such uncertainty it was empty it smelled musty unused and there were green streaks of damp and horrible flowered wallpaper but it still had a kind of grandeur with its parquet floors and cornices and mantlepieces of marble suggesting to me a whole way of life that id probably gleaned from tv costume drama men taking a rest from empire building who warmed their backs at the fire port political conversations i couldnt begin to imagine that i could feel at home in these imposing spaces i walked round the edge of this room my footsteps echoing in the emptiness and felt flimsy insubstantial as though i might float to the ceiling as though nothing weighed me down richard put his arm round me 151 he did that often then 151 and i felt his warmth his weight his opulent smell of cigars and aftershave grounding me making me real and the estate agent a pleasant woman canny about such things read my hesitation let me show you something she said she took us through the french doors and into the garden it was big for a town garden and secluded with a rose bed badly neglected just a few tattered rags of roses still clinging to the gangly bloodred stems and a pond empty of water with weeds growing up from the concrete the starlings in the birch tree were puffed up with the cold like fruit ready to fall there were worm casts in the grass and pools of water lying on the lawn and it all terribly needed tending but the lovely shapes of it were there 151 the rose bed and the pond and the way the trees leaned in around the lawn encircling it with a kind of intimacy and i saw how it could be saw the stone frog spewing water from his wide cheerful mouth saw the lily pads and the oldfashioned roses palest pink and amber single flowers not lasting long but scented clambering up the wall from that moment it was easy we bought it and moved in and i knew just what to do with it decorating most of it myself i seemed to expand to fill the space it started to feel right for me and now it is all as it should be elegant established with velvet curtains and tiebacks with tassels and heavy pelmets edged with plumcolored braid our things look right here in this setting everything seems to fit richards chinese vases and his violin and the two ceramic masks one white one black that we brought back from our honeymoon and a little painting i did of a poppy that i thought was maybe good enough to frame and go up on the wall and on the mantelpiece theres a cardboard nativity scene intricate in rich dark colors that i bought from benjamin pollocks toyshop in covent garden the nativity scene was my choice not the girls theyd probably have gone for something more contemporary and plastic but i love traditional things im always hunting them out in junk shops and on market stalls things made to old designs or with a patina of use a bit of history like when i decorated daisys room the floors stripped and varnished to a pale honey color the ceiling nightsky blue with a stenciling of stars and i knew there was something missing it needed something old loved a teddy bear to sit in the cane chair an old bear with bits of fur worn off like people sometimes keep in trunks in their attics and i wondered what it would be like to have had a childhood that left such traces 151 old toys photos perhaps 151 things that are worn with use with loving to store away then come upon years later and show to your own children with a little stir of sentiment or mildly embarrassed amusement or nostalgia in the end i found a bear in a department store it had oldfashioned curly fur and was dressed in edwardian clothes but it smelled of the factory i bought it anyway it was the best i could do the women are reminiscing about recent toy obsessions 151 furbies and pok233mon and tamagotchis the pocket computer animals that you have to feed and care for natalies mother saw a woman at a school concert who had three tamagotchis hanging round her neck so she could look after them now that is going too far i mean she was really under the thumb im only halflistening over their shoulders i can see richard talking to somebodys teenage daughter he looks too smart for the company in his jacket and tie 151 he isnt very good at casual dressing the girl is perhaps eighteen just a little younger than i was when he chose me shes wearing a sleeveless top in spite of the snow showing off her prettily sloping shoulders her arms are thin and white and her hair is watered silk and she has a big gleamy smile i can tell hes charming her he comes from that privileged class of men who are always charming 151 perhaps most charming 151 with strangers and richard likes young women its what he was drawn to in me that new gloss i know im not like i was when first we met i dont have that sheen anymore nicky is next to richard talking to the man with the unruly hair shes getting in close 151 not surprising really hes quite attractive now that shes taken off her coat she looks like a picture from a magazine theres something altogether contemporary about nicky she has leather skirts and boots with molded rubber soles and she works at an advertising agency where in spite of 151 or maybe because of 151 the niceness and easygoingness of neil her husband who is an inventive cook and a devoted parent she exchanges erotic emails with the creative director you see were not like you and richard she says to me sometimes leaning across the table at the caf233 rouge toward me you two are so transparently everything to each other i mean its wonderful if you can be like that 151 if youve got that kind of marriage 151 what could be lovelier but neil and i arent like that especially since the kids maybe we couldnt ever be i dont think im built to be completely faithful its just not in my genes she feels my eyes on her she turns speaks to the man again they come toward me kates mother and natalies mother move away he smiles at me his eyes are gray and steady nicky puts her hand on my arm meet fergal she says our latest recruit a tenor tenors are like gold dust i love my tenors to bits i smile he says hello i remember how much i like irish voices nicky takes her last bite of apple cake and licks her sugary fingers catriona your cooking is out of this world i have to have more of this sinead walks past with a plate nicky lunges after her my boots have high heels and my eyes are just on a level with his we look at each other and theres a brief embarrassed pause i liked the carols i tell him then think how vacuous this sounds well he says and shrugs a little its been fun i note the past tense i rapidly decide that hes not the sort of man whod like me i know how i must seem to him a privileged sheltered woman nickys good at arranging things i say making things happen he nods vaguely hes looking over my shoulder ive bored him already but then i see he is looking at my picture 151 the painting of poppies that i hung on the wall its just behind me who did the painting he asks i did i wondered if it was you he says i like it i feel a little awkward but acknowledge to myself that i am quite pleased with this painting the petals are that dark purple that is almost black yet theres a gleam on them i dont do much i say it just makes a nice break i can hide away in my attic and the girls know not to disturb me i suppose its a bit conceited to put it up on the wall dyou always do that he asks do what run yourself down like that probably i guess its irritating we both smile when you paint is it always flowers he asks always i cant do people im really limited he looks at me quizzically his eyes are full of laughter ok i know im doing it again i say but its true and i cant draw out of my head either it has to be something i can put on the table in front of me i can only paint what i see dyou sell them i nod flattered he should ask theres a gift shop in kingston that takes them sometimes he looks at it again its not very cheerful for a flower its kind of ominous all that shadow around it really how can you read all that into a picture but im pleased theres something rather trivial about doing paintings of flowers and selling them in a gift shop alongside scented candles and boxed sets of soap i like that he can see a kind of darkness in it i realize i am happy my body fluid and easy with the wine my room hospitable beautiful this man with the irish lilt in his voice approving of my picture this is easy this is how things should be hes looking at me with those steady gray eyes theres something in his look that i cant work out sex or something else more obscure more troubling i know you he says suddenly dont i i laugh politely i dont think so someone is leaving the door opens the cold and the night come in i do he says im sure i know you i recognize your face hes staring at me trying to work it out it sounds like a comeon but his look is puzzled serious the fear that is never far from me lays its cold hand on my skin well i dont know where you could have seen me my voice is casual light perhaps the school gate at saint marks daisy goes there but i know this isnt right i know id have noticed him nicky says thats where your little boy goes i add trying to drag the conversation away to somewhere safe he shakes his head jamie doesnt start till after christmas youll like it i tell him daisys eight shes in year three she has the nicest teacher but he wont let it rest where dyou work he asks i dont then biting back the urge to apologize for my life that must sound so passive 151 i mean not outside the home i used to work in a nursery school but thats ages ago now it wasnt there forget it it doesnt matter but im upset and he knows it he tries to carry on he tells me a bit about his work hes a journalist he says and he asks what im painting now and where my ideas come from but the mood is spoiled it cant be restored or recovered as soon as he decently can he leaves me all evening i feel troubled even when the singers have gone calling out their thanks and christmas wishes setting off into the snow which is falling more thickly now casting its nets over everything under the chill thin light of the moon of beginnings we stand there in the suddenly quiet room it looks banal now there are cake crumbs on the carpet and every glass has a purplish spicy sediment ill do the washing up says richard normally id say no let me you sit down but tonight i give in gratefully sinead goes to help him i turn off the light again and the firelight plays on every shiny surface my living room seems like a room from another time i stretch out on the sofa daisy comes and folds herself into me her limbs are loose heavy her skin is hot and dry i feel her tiredness seeping into me did you enjoy it i ask her to my surprise she shakes her head in the red erratic firelight her face looks sharper thinner little bright flames glitter in her eyes suddenly without warning she starts crying i hug her its ever so late i tell her youll be fine in the morning she rubs her damp face against me i dont want her to go to sleep unhappy i can never bear it when shes sad 151 which is silly really i know that because children often cry i always rush in to smooth things over want to keep everything perfect so i try to distract her with shadow shapes the animal patterns i learned how to make from a booklet i bought at the toy shop in covent garden i move my hands in the beam of light from the open door to the hall casting shadows across the wall by the fireplace i make the seagull flapping my hands together and the crab my fingers hunched so it sidles along the mantelpiece and the alligator snapping at the board games on the bookshelf daisy wipes her face and starts to smile i make the shape of the weasel we wait and wait daisy holding her breath this is her favorite and just when youve stopped expecting it it comes the weasels pounce down into some poor defenseless thing behind the skirting board she lets out a brief thrilled scream and even i start a little yet these animals these teeth this predatoriness these are only the shadows of my hands
