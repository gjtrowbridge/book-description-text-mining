 the hospital somewhere in maryland at about eleven in the evening dr ethan kane trudged down the grayandbluepainted corridor toward a private elevator his mind was filled with images of death and suffering but also progress great progress that would change the world a young and quite homely scrub nurse rounded the corner of the passageway and nodded her head deferentially as she approached him she had a crush on dr kane and she wasn8217t the only one 8220doctor8221 she said 8220you8217re still working8221 8220esther you go home now please8221 ethan kane said pretending to be solicitous and caring which couldn8217t have been further from the truth he considered the nurse inferior in every way including the fact that she was female he was also exhausted from a surgical marathon five major operations in a day the elevator car finally arrived the doors slid open and he stepped inside 8220good night esther8221 he said and showed the nurse a lot of very white teeth but no genuine warmth because there was none to show he straightened his tall body and wearily passed his hand over his longish blond hair cleaned his wirerimmed glasses on the tail of his lab coat then rubbed his eyes before putting his glasses back on as he descended to the subbasement level one more thing to check on always one more thing to do he walked half a dozen quick steps to a thick steel door and pushed it open with the palm of his hand he entered the dark and chilly atmosphere of a basement storage room a pungent odor struck him there lying on a double row of gurneys were six naked bodies four men two women all in their late teens and early twenties each was braindead each as good as gone but each had served a worthy cause a higher purpose the plastic bracelets on their wrists said donor 8220you8217re making the world a better place8221 kane whispered as he passed the bodies 8220take comfort in that8221 dr kane strode to the far end of the room and pushed open another steel door an exact duplicate of the first this time rather than a chilly blast he was met by a searing wave of hot air the deafening roar of fire and the unmistakable smell of death all three incinerators were going tonight two of his nighttime porters their powerful workingman bodies glistening with grime and sweat looked up as dr kane entered the cinderblock chamber the men nodded respectfully but their eyes showed fear 8220let8217s pick up the pace gentlemen this is taking too long8221 kane called out 8220let8217s go let8217s go you8217re being paid well for this scut work too well8221 he glanced at a naked young woman8217s corpse laid out on the cement floor she was whiteblond pretty in a musicvideo sort of way the porters had probably been diddling with her that8217s why they were behind schedule wasn8217t it gurneys were shoved haphazardly into one corner like discarded shopping carts in a supermarket parking lot quite a spectacle hellish to be sure as he watched one of the sweatglazed minions worked a wooden paddle under a young male8217s body while the other swung open the heavy glass door of an oven together they pushed shoved slid the body into the fire as if it were a pizza the flames dampened for a moment then as the porters locked down the door the inferno flared again the cremation chamber was called a 8220retort8221 each retort burned at 3600 degrees and it took just over fifteen minutes to reduce a human body to nothing but ashes to dr ethan kane that meant one thing no evidence of what was happening at the hospital absolutely no evidence of resurrection 8220pick up the pace8221 he yelled again 8220burn these bodies8221 the donors
