 since there was little he could do about his situation he seemed determined to strike as picturesque and dramatic a pose as possible the back of one hand rested despairingly across his forehead while his other arm was thrown wide in a flamboyant attitude the only part of his face visible therefore was his mouth which was pursed and plump as if the world were too hot and coarse for his palate and he felt the need to blow it cool the mouth was moving spilling out long languorous sentences in a way which suggested that despite his predicament the speaker rather enjoyed the sound of his own voice quot before even the travesty in three acts had seen print quot the speaker sighed deeply and combed his fingers through his disheveled hair before placing his hand back across his eyes quot and this is to be the end of eponymous clent left out in the wilderness to be devoured by the savage geese and weaselly faced imps of the forestmdashquot the flow of words stopped abruptly cautiously he uncovered his eyes once more quotare you humanquot it was a fair question rust grime and lichen covered moscas face like warpaint and dove feathers still clung to her hair and arms the unlit pipe in her mouth also gave her an otherworldly youngold look she nodded quotwhat do you wantquot mosca swung her legs over to sit in the quotsaddlequot more comfortably and took the pipe out of her mouth quoti want a jobquot quoti fear that adverse circumstances have deprived me of all monetary advantages and simple luxuries and did you say a jobquot quotyesquot mosca pointed to the stocks quoti got the keys to those but if i let you out you got to give me a job and take me with youquot quotfancyquot clent said with a faint desolate laugh quotthe child wishes to leave all thisquot he glanced around at the dripping trees the bonewhite stones and the cold colors of the distant village quoti want to travelquot mosca declared quotthe sooner the betterquot she added with an apprehensive look over her shoulder quotdo you even have the first idea of what my profession entailsquot quotyesquot said mosca quotyou tell lies for moneyquot quotah aha my child you have a flawed grasp of the nature of mythmaking i am a poet and storyteller a creator of ballads and sagas pray do not confuse the exercise of the imagination with mere mendacity i am a master of the mysteries of words their meanings and music and mellifluous magicquot mendacity thought mosca mellifluous she did not know what they meant but the words had shapes in her mind she memorized them and stroked them in her thoughts like the curved backs of cats words words wonderful words but lies too quoti hear you told the widow a story bout how you was the son of a duke and was going to marry her when you came into your lands but how you needed to borrow money so you could hire a lawyer and make your claimquot quotah a very emotional woman tended to take ah figures of speech very literallyquot quotand i heard you told the magistrate a story bout how there was this cure for his aches which you just needed to send for but which cost lots of money and i heard you told all the shopkeepers a story bout how your secretary was coming any day and bringing all your trunks and the rest of your money so you could pay all your bills thenquot quotyes er quite true cant imagine what can have happened to the fellow quot quotthey brand thieves hands dont theyquot mosca added suddenly quotspose theyll brand your tongue for lying spose it stands to reasonquot everything was very quiet for a few moments except for the rattle of water on rock and the sound of clent swallowing drily yes i i have quite lost patience with that secretary of mine i suppose i must let him go which means that i have a vacancy do you do you have any qualifications or assets to offer as a secretary may i askquot quoti got thesequot mosca jangled the keys quothmm a practical outlook and a concise way of speaking both very useful qualities very well you may unlock mequot mosca slid down from her stone throne and scrambled up the craggy pedestal to slot the key into the lock quotpurely out of interestquot clent asked as he watched her upside down quotwhat so bewitches you about the idea of the traveling lifequot there were many answers mosca could have given him she dreamed of a world without the eternal sounds of glass beads being shaken in a sieve and goblins chuckling in the ravines she dreamed of a world where her best friend did not have feathers and a beak the color of pumpkin peel she dreamed of a world where books did not rot or give way to green blot where words and ideas were not things you were despised for treasuring she dreamed of a world in which her stockings were not always wet there was another more pressing reason though mosca raised her head and stared up the hillside toward the ragged treeline the sky was warmed by a gentle redness suggesting a soft but radiant dawn the true dawn was still some three hours away quotvery soonquot mosca said quietly quotmy uncle will wake up an when he does hes likely to notice that ive burned down his millquot
