 chapter excerpt chapter one behind the eight ball july 24 434 am frederick maryland the saboteur had arrived grayson pierce edged his motorcycle between the dark buildings that made up the heart of fort detrick he kept the bike idling its electric engine purred no louder than a refrigerators motor the black gloves he wore matched the bikes paint a nickelphosphorous compound called npl super black it absorbed more visible light making ordinary black seem positively shiny his cloth body suit and rigid helmet were equally shaded hunched over the bike he neared the end of the alley a courtyard opened ahead a dark chasm framed by the brickandmortar buildings that composed the national cancer institute an adjunct to usamriid the us army medical research institute of infectious diseases here the countrys war on bioterrorism was waged across sixty thousand square feet of maximumcontainment labs gray cut the engine but stayed seated his left knee rested against the satchel it held the seventy thousand dollars he remained in the alley avoiding the open courtyard he preferred the dark the moon had long set and the sun would not rise for another twentytwo minutes even the stars remained clouded by the shredding tail of last nights summer storm would his ruse hold he subvocalized into his throat mike mule to eagle ive reached the rendezvous proceeding on foot roger that weve got you on satellite gray resisted the urge to look up and wave he hated to be watched scrutinized but the deal here was too big he did manage to gain a concession to take the meeting alone his contact was skittish it had taken six months to groom this contact brokering connections in libya and the sudan it hadnt been easy money did not buy much trust especially in this business he reached down to the satchel and shouldered the money bag wary he walked his bike over to a shadowed alcove parked it and hooked a leg over the seat he crossed down the alley there were few eyes awake at this hour and most of those were only electronic all of his identification had passed inspection at the old farm gate the service entrance to the base and now he had to trust that his subterfuge held out long enough to evade electronic surveillance he glanced to the glowing dial on his breitling divers watch 445 the meeting was set for fifteen minutes from now so much depended on his success here gray reached his destination building 470 it was deserted at this hour due for demolition next month poorly secured the building was perfect for the rendezvous yet the choice of venue was also oddly ironic in the sixties spores of anthrax had been brewed inside the building in giant vats and tanks fermenting strains of bacterial death until the toxic brewery had been decommissioned back in 1971 since then the building had been left fallow becoming a giant storage closet for the national cancer institute but once again the business of anthrax would be conducted under this roof he glanced up the windows were all dark he was to meet the seller on the fourth floor reaching the side door he swiped the lock with an electronic keycard supplied by his contact at the base he carried the second half of the mans payment over his shoulder having wired the first half a month before gray also bore a footlong plastic carbonized dagger in a concealed wrist sheath his only weapon he couldnt risk bringing anything else through the security gate gray closed the door and crossed to the stairwell on the right the only light on the stairs came from the red exit sign he reached to his motorcycle helmet and toggled on the nightvision mode the world brightened in tones of green and silver he mounted the stairs and climbed quickly to the fourth floor at the top he pushed through the landings door he had no idea where he was supposed to meet his contact only that he was to await the mans signal he paused for a breath at the door surveying the space before him he didnt like it the stairwell opened at the corner of the building one corridor stretched straight ahead the other ran to the left frosted glass office doors lined the inner walls windows slitted the other he proceeded directly ahead at a slow pace alert for any sign of movement a flood of light swept through one of the windows washing over him dazzled through his nightvision he rolled against one wall back into darkness had he been spotted the sweep of light pierced the other windows one after the other passing down the hall ahead of him leaning out he peered through one of the windows it faced the wide courtyard that fronted the building across the way he watched a humvee trundle slowly down the street its searchlight swept through the courtyard a patrol would the attention spook his contact cursing silently gray waited for the truck to finish its round the patrol vanished momentarily crossing behind a hulking structure that rose from the middle of the courtyard below it looked like some rusting spaceship but was in fact a millionliter steel containment sphere three stories tall mounted on a dozen pedestal legs ladders and scaffolding surrounded the structure as it underwent a renovation an attempt to return it to its former glory when it was a cold war research facility even the steel catwalk that had once circumnavigated the globes equator had been replaced gray knew the giant globes nickname at the base the eight ball
