 chapter one early on the morning of august 19 1946 i was born under a clear sky after a violent summer storm to a widowed mother in the julia chester hospital in hope a town of about six thousand in southwest arkansas thirtythree miles east of the texas border at texarkana my mother named me william jefferson blythe iii after my father william jefferson blythe jr one of nine children of a poor farmer in sherman texas who died when my father was seventeen according to his sisters my father always tried to take care of them and he grew up to be a handsome hardworking funloving man he met my mother at tri state hospital in shreveport louisiana in 1943 when she was training to be a nurse many times when i was growing up i asked mother to tell me the story of their meeting courting and marriage he brought a date with some kind of medical emergency into the ward where she was working and they talked and flirted while the other woman was being treated on his way out of the hospital he touched the finger on which she was wearing her boyfriends ring and asked her if she was married she stammered no8212she was single the next day he sent the other woman flowers and her heart sank then he called mother for a date explaining that he always sent flowers when he ended a relationship two months later they were married and he was off to war he served in a motor pool in the invasion of italy repairing jeeps and tanks after the war he returned to hope for mother and they moved to chicago where he got back his old job as a salesman for the manbee equipment company they bought a little house in the suburb of forest park but couldnt move in for a couple of months and since mother was pregnant with me they decided she should go home to hope until they could get into the new house on may 17 1946 after moving their furniture into their new home my father was driving from chicago to hope to fetch his wife late at night on highway 60 outside of sikeston missouri he lost control of his car a 1942 buick when the right front tire blew out on a wet road he was thrown clear of the car but landed in or crawled into a drainage ditch dug to reclaim swampland the ditch held three feet of water when he was found after a twohour search his hand was grasping a branch above the waterline he had tried but failed to pull himself out he drowned only twentyeight years old married two years and eight months only seven months of which he had spent with mother that brief sketch is about all i ever really knew about my father all my life i have been hungry to fill in the blanks clinging eagerly to every photo or story or scrap of paper that would tell me more of the man who gave me life when i was about twelve sitting on my uncle buddys porch in hope a man walked up the steps looked at me and said youre bill blythes son you look just like him i beamed for days in 1974 i was running for congress it was my first race and the local paper did a feature story on my mother she was at her regular coffee shop early in the morning discussing the article with a lawyer friend when one of the breakfast regulars she knew only casually came up to her and said i was there i was the first one at the wreck that night he then told mother what he had seen including the fact that my father had retained enough consciousness or survival instinct to try to claw himself up and out of the water before he died mother thanked him went out to her car and cried then dried her tears and went to work in 1993 on fathers day my first as president the washington post ran a long investigative story on my father which was followed over the next two months by other investigative pieces by the associated press and many smaller papers the stories confirmed the things my mother and i knew they also turned up a lot we didnt know including the fact that my father had probably been married three times before he met mother and apparently had at least two more children my fathers other son was identified as leon ritzenthaler a retired owner of a janitorial service from northern california in the article he said he had written me during the 92 campaign but had received no reply i dont remember hearing about his letter and considering all the other bullets we were dodging then its possible that my staff kept it from me or maybe the letter was just misplaced in the mountains of mail we were receiving anyway when i read about leon i got in touch with him and later met him and his wife judy during one of my stops in northern california we had a happy visit and since then weve corresponded in holiday seasons he and i look alike his birth certificate says his father was mine and i wish id known about him a long time ago somewhere around this time i also received information confirming news stories about a daughter sharon pettijohn born sharon lee blythe in kansas city in 1941 to a woman my father later divorced she sent copies of her birth certificate her parents marriage license a photo of my father and a letter to her mother from my father asking about our baby to betsey wright my former chief of staff in the governors office im sorry to say that for whatever reason ive never met her this news breaking in 1993 came as a shock to mother who by then had been battling cancer for some time but she took it all in stride she said young people did a lot of things during the depression and the war that people in another time might disapprove of what mattered was that my father was the love of her life and she had no doubt of his love for her whatever the facts thats all she needed to know as her own life moved toward its end as for me i wasnt quite sure what to make of it all but given the life ive led i could hardly be surprised that my father was more complicated than the idealized pictures i had lived with for nearly half a century in 1994 as we headed for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of dday several newspapers published a story on my fathers war record with a snapshot of him in uniform shortly afterward i received a letter from umberto baron of netcong new jersey recounting his own experiences during the war and after he said that he was a young boy in italy when the americans arrived and that he loved to go to their camp where one soldier in particular befriended him giving him candy and showing him how engines worked and how to repair them he knew him only as bill after the war baron came to the united states and inspired by what he had learned from the soldier who called him little gi joe he opened his own garage and started a family he told me he had lived the american dream with a thriving business and three children he said he owed so much of his success in life to that young soldier but hadnt had the opportunity to say goodbye then and had often wondered what had happened to him then he said on memorial day of this year i was thumbing through a copy of the new york daily news with my morning coffee when suddenly i felt as if i was struck by lightning there in the lower lefthand corner of the paper was a photo of bill i felt chills to learn that bill was none other than the father of the president of the united states in 1996 the children of one of my fathers sisters came for the first time to our annual family christmas party at the white house and brought me a gift the condolence letter my aunt had received from her congressman the great sam rayburn after my father died its just a short form letter and appears to have been signed with the autopen of the day but i hugged that letter with all the glee of a sixyearold boy getting his first train set from santa claus i hung it in my private office on the second floor of the white house and looked at it every night shortly after i left the white house i was boarding the usair shuttle in washington for new york when an airline employee stopped me to say that his stepfather had just told him he had served in the war with my father and had liked him very much i asked for the old vets phone number and address and the man said he didnt have it but would get it to me im still waiting hoping there will be one more human connection to my father at the end of my presidency i picked a few special places to say goodbye and thanks to the american people one of them was chicago where hillary was born where i all but clinched the democratic nomination on st patricks day 1992 where many of my most ardent supporters live and many of my most important domestic initiatives in crime welfare and education were proved effective and of course where my parents went to live after the war i used to joke with hillary that if my father hadnt lost his life on that rainy missouri highway i would have grown up a few miles from her and we probably never would have met my last event was in the palmer house hotel scene of the only photo i have of my parents together taken just before mother came back to hope in 1946 after the speech and the goodbyes i went into a small room where i met a woman mary etta rees and her two daughters she told me she had grown up and gone to high school with my mother then had gone north to indiana to work in a war industry married stayed and raised her children then she gave me another precious gift the letter my twentythreeyearold mother had written on her birthday to her friend three weeks after my fathers death more than fiftyfour years earlier it was vintage mother in her beautiful hand she wrote of her heartbreak and her determination to carry on it seemed almost unbelievable at the time but you see i am six months pregnant and the thought of our baby keeps me going and really gives me the whole world before me my mother left me the wedding ring she gave my father a few moving stories and the sure knowledge that she was loving me for him too my father left me with the feeling that i had to live for two people and that if i did it well enough somehow i could make up for the life he should have had and his memory infused me at a younger age than most with a sense of my own mortality the knowledge that i too could die young drove me both to try to drain the most out of every moment of life and to get on with the next big challenge even when i wasnt sure where i was going i was always in a hurry
