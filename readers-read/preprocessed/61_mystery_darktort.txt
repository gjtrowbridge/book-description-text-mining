 chapter one i tripped over the body of my friend dusty routt at half past ten on the night of october 19 at first i thought it was a joke loaded down with breadmaking supplies i had just pushed through the heavy wooden door of hanrahan jule the boutique law firm in aspen meadow where id been catering breakfasts for several months my foot caught and i stumbled forward i thought those hj clowns are up to something again the bag of flour i was carrying slid from my hands and exploded on the carpet two jars of yeast plummeted onto the coffee table where they burst into shards and powder my last bottle of molasses sailed in a wide arc and cracked open on the receptionists cherrywood desk a thick wave of sweet dark liquid began a gluey descent across the phone console my steel bowl of bread sponge catapulted out of my arms and hit the wall i wasnt sure id be able to change my own trajectory toward an end table it was one of two roughhewn cabinstyle monstrosities that the decorator had thought necessary to make hanrahan jule look like what it claimed to be your rocky mountain neighborhood law firm i hit the end table ricocheted over to the desk cried out and finally landed on my stomach i had tripped over iknewnotwhat in a spectacular manner and now i was prone on an imitation native american rug i shrieked very funny fellas but the lawyers who pulled these pranks didnt appear i wiped flour out of my eyes and waited for the guys to reveal themselves when they didnt i tried to focus on what i could see of the small lobby space lamps made of elk horns sat on the clunky tables the bentwood couches which were placed beneath homey paintings of food were empty i was lying on a spongesoaked picture of a tepee the pain assaulting my tailbone was excruciating gritting my teeth i figured i was about as upset as any caterer could be when the bread for the following mornings breakfast has been wrecked the night before i still hadnt seen what had caused my fall nor was there any telltale noise in fact the law firm of hanrahan jule was completely quiet id ended up on the far side of the massive coffee table a thick column of wood carved id been told from the trunk of an ancient blue spruce tree i rubbed my behind and stared at the dark lacquered bark had i just stumbled over my own feet no i was sure the small cadre of lawyers who were not in maui this week ostensibly engaging in continuing education was responsible for this mishap i heaved myself onto my back wondering if the guys and thats what all ten hj lawyers were guys would think this was more funny than when theyd put green food coloring into the cheddar omelettes or how about the live moths that had fluttered out of one of my folded tablecloths and then oh lord then there was the ginswitchedforwater in my espresso machine soon after that trick id seen one of the partners pouring vodka into the very same machines water well id used my tray to whack him from behind accidentally of course and spewed forty dollars worth of stolichnaya across the firms huge kitchen staring at the ceiling i sighed now that my flour yeast molasses and sponge were kaput was the partner whod ordered the breakfast going to run out and buy freshly baked loaves for his fridaymorning meeting with clients i doubted it very much i wrenched my body around to survey the damage and there sprawled on the far side of the coffee table was dusty routt in addition to being a friend dusty was our neighbor she was also in training to become the firms second paralegal and she often got drafted into playing a part in these high jinks at the very least she was sometimes pressed into trying to cover them up as id discovered after the spikedcoffee affair when id caught her disposing of a plastic bag holding two empty gin bottles orders from king richard dusty had whispered conspiratorially he says i have to get rid of the evidence without you catching me that is shed added with a characteristic giggle as she slammed the dumpster lid shut since king richard was dustys uncle richard chenault the same partner whose stoly i later disposed of i knew a confrontation was out of the question just this past august richards secretary had been summarily fired when shed had the audacity or stupidity to send a locket engraved for richards mistress to his uh wife richards wife a doctor named kd had promptly filed for divorce i stared at dustys back waiting i couldnt see her face still i knew it was dusty there was her highlightedathome hair there was the likenew beige calvin klein suit she was wearing id actually found the suit for her at aspen meadows secondhand store now i wanted to hear her high joyful voice as she jumped up to cry surprise i anticipated a trio of attorneys leaping out from behind the receptionists desk and squealing gotcha but i still couldnt hear anything at all dusty i whispered hoarsely get up gags over she didnt move i did finally hear something but it was only the steady plink plop of beaten egg dripping onto one of the end tables my gaze shifted from dusty to where the sponge liquid had first landed on charlie bakers painting of peach pie one of three of his famous pictures of food that adorned the lobby walls the frame was broken had i done that to dear departed charlie bakers artwork charlie baker i swallowed dont go there i ordered myself but then i squinted at some splotches and drips that had stained the painted pie with its list of ingredients meticulously penned underneath
