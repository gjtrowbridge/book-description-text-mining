 february 17 1988 i opened my eyes and heard a procession of sounds first the phone going off on the opposite side of the bed rousing us at 504 am to what could only be a calamity then rain pummeling the roof of our old victorian house sluicing its sneaky way to the basement and finally small puffs of air coming from hughrsquos lower lip each one perfectly timed like a metronome twenty years of this puffing irsquod heard it when he wasnrsquot even asleep when he sat in his leather wing chair after dinner reading through the column of psychiatric journals rising from the floor and it would seem like the cadence against which my entire life was set the phone rang again and i lay there waiting for hugh to pick up certain it was one of his patients probably the paranoid schizophrenic whorsquod phoned last night convinced the cia had him cornered in a federal building in downtown atlanta a third ring and hugh fumbled for the receiver ldquoyes hellordquo he said and his voice came out coarse a hangover from sleep i rolled away from him then and stared across the room at the faint watery light on the window remembering that today was ash wednesday feeling the inevitable rush of guilt my father had died on ash wednesday when i was nine years old and in a convoluted way a way that made no sense to anyone but me it had been at least partially my fault there had been a fire on his boat a fueltank explosion theyrsquod said pieces of the boat had washed up weeks later including a portion of the stern with jessea printed on it hersquod named the boat for me not for my brother mike or even for my mother whom hersquod adored but for me jessie i closed my eyes and saw oily flames and roaring orange light an article in the charleston newspaper had referred to the explosion as suspicious and there had been some kind of investigation though nothing had ever come of itmdashthings mike and irsquod discovered only because wersquod sneaked the clipping from motherrsquos dresser drawer a strange secret place filled with fractured rosaries discarded saint medals holy cards and a small statue of jesus missing his left arm she had not imagined we would venture into all that brokendown holiness i went into that terrible sanctum almost every day for over a year and read the article obsessively that one particular line ldquopolice speculate that a spark from his pipe may have ignited a leak in the fuel linerdquo irsquod given him the pipe for fatherrsquos day up until then he had never even smoked i still could not think of him apart from the word ldquosuspiciousrdquo apart from this day how hersquod become ash the very day people everywheremdashme mike and my mothermdashgot our foreheads smudged with it at church yet another irony in a whole black ensemble of them ldquoyes of course i remember yourdquo i heard hugh say into the phone yanking me back to the call the bleary morning he said ldquoyes wersquore all fine here and how are things thererdquo this didnrsquot sound like a patient and it wasnrsquot our daughter dee i was sure of that i could tell by the formality in his voice i wondered if it was one of hughrsquos colleagues or a resident at the hospital they called sometimes to consult about a case though generally not at five in the morning i slipped out from the covers and moved with bare feet to the window across the room wanting to see how likely it was that rain would flood the basement again and wash out the pilot light on the hotwater heater i stared out at the cold granular deluge the bluish fog the street already swollen with water and i shivered wishing the house were easier to warm irsquod nearly driven hugh crazy to buy this big impractical house and even though wersquod been in it seven years now i still refused to criticize it i loved the sixteenfoot ceilings and stainedglass transoms and the turretmdashgod i loved the turret how many houses had one of those you had to climb the spiral stairs inside it to get to my art studio a transformed thirdfloor attic space with a sharply slanted ceiling and a skylightmdashso remote and enchanting that dee had dubbed it the ldquorapunzel towerrdquo she was always teasing me about it ldquohey mom when are you gonna let your hair downrdquo that was dee being playful being dee but we both knew what she meantmdashthat irsquod become too stuffy and selfprotected too conventional this past christmas while she was home irsquod posted a gary larson cartoon on the refrigerator with a magnet that proclaimed me worldrsquos greatest mom in it two cows stood in their idyllic pasture one announced to the other ldquoi donrsquot care what they say irsquom not contentrdquo irsquod meant it as a little joke for dee i remembered now how hugh had laughed at it hugh who read people as if they were human rorschachs yet hersquod seen nothing suggestive in it it was dee whorsquod stood before it an inordinate amount of time then given me a funny look she hadnrsquot laughed at all to be honest i had been restless it had started back in the fallmdashthis feeling of time passing of being postponed pent up not wanting to go up to my studio the sensation would rise suddenly like freight from the ocean floormdashthe unexpected discontent of cows in their pasture the constant chewing of all that cud with winter the feeling had deepened i would see a neighbor running along the sidewalk in front of the house training i imagined for a climb up kilimanjaro or a friend at my book club giving a blowbyblow of her bungee jump from a bridge in australia ormdashand this was the worst of allmdasha tv show about some intrepid woman traveling alone in the blueness of greece and irsquod be overcome by the little river of sparks that seemed to run beneath all that the bloodsapwine aliveness whatever it was it had made me feel bereft over the immensity of the world the extraordinary things people did with their livesmdashthough really i didnrsquot want to do any of those particular things i didnrsquot know then what i wanted but the ache for it was palpable i felt it that morning standing beside the window the quick furtive way it insinuated itself and i had no idea what to say to myself about it hugh seemed to think my little collapse of spirit or whatever it was i was having was about deersquos being away at college the clicheacuted empty nest and all that last fall after wersquod gotten her settled at vanderbilt hugh and irsquod rushed home so he could play in the waverly harris cancer classic a tennis tournament hersquod been worked up about all summer hersquod gone out in the georgia heat for three months and practiced twice a week with a fancy prince graphite racket then irsquod ended up crying all the way home from nashville i kept picturing dee standing in front of her dorm waving goodbye as we pulled away she touched her eye her chest then pointed at usmdasha thing shersquod done since she was a little girl eye heart you it did me in when we got home despite my protests hugh called his doubles partner scott to take his place in the tournament and stayed home and watched a movie with me an officer and a gentleman he pretended very hard to like it the deep sadness i felt in the car that day had lingered for a couple of weeks but it had finally lifted i did miss dee mdashof course i didmdashbut i couldnrsquot believe that was the real heart of the matter lately hugh had pushed me to see dr ilg one of the psychiatrists in his practice irsquod refused on the grounds that she had a parrot in her office i knew that would drive him crazy this wasnrsquot the real reason of coursemdashi have nothing against peoplersquos having parrots except that they keep them in little cages but i used it as a way of letting him know i wasnrsquot taking the suggestion seriously it was one of the rare times i didnrsquot acquiesce to him so shersquos got a parrot so whatrdquo hersquod said ldquoyoursquod like herrdquo probably i would but i couldnrsquot quite bring myself to go that farmdashall that paddling around in the alphabet soup of onersquos childhood scooping up letters hoping to arrange them into enlightening sentences that would explain why things had turned out the way they had it evoked a certain mutiny in me i did occasionally though play out imaginary sessions with dr ilg in my head i would tell her about my father and grunting she would write it down on a little padmdashwhich is all she ever seemed to do i pictured her bird as a dazzling white cockatoo perched on the back of her chair belting out all sorts of flagrant opinions repeating itself like a greek chorus ldquoyou blame yourself you blame yourself you blame yourselfrdquo not long agomdashi donrsquot know what possessed me to do itmdashirsquod told hugh about these makebelieve sessions with dr ilg even about the bird and hersquod smiled ldquomaybe you should just see the birdrdquo he said ldquoyour dr ilg sounds like an idiotrdquo now across the room hugh was listening to the person on the phone muttering ldquouhhuh uhhuhrdquo his face had clamped down into what dee called ldquothe big frownrdquo that pinched expression of grave and intense listening in which you could almost see the various pistons in his brainmdashfreud jung adler horney winnicottmdashbobbing up and down wind lapped over the roof and i heard the house begin to singmdashas it routinely didmdashwith an operatic voice that was very beverly ldquoshrillrdquo as we liked to say there were also doors that refused to close ancient toilets that would suddenly decline to flush ldquothe toilets have gone analretentive againrdquo dee would shout and i had to keep constant vigilance to prevent hugh from exterminating the flying squirrels that lived in the fireplace in his study if we ever got a divorce he loved to joke it would be about squirrels but i loved all of this i truly did it was only the basement floods and the winter drafts that i hated and now with dee in her first year at vanderbilt the emptinessmdashi hated that hugh was hunched on his side of the bed his elbows balanced on his knees and the top two knobs of his spine visible through his pajamas he said ldquoyou realize this is a serious situation donrsquot you she needs to see someonemdashi mean an actual psychiatristrdquo i felt sure then it was a resident at the hospital though it did seem hugh was talking down to him and that was not like hugh through the window the neighborhood looked drowned as if the housesmdashsome as big as arksmdashmight lift off their foundations and float down the street i hated the thought of slogging out into this mess but of course i would i would drive to sacred heart of mary over on peachtree and get my forehead swiped with ashes when dee was small shersquod mistakenly called the church the ldquo scared heart of maryrdquo the two of us still referred to it that way sometimes and it occurred to me now how apt the name really was i mean if mary was still around like so many people thought including my insatiably catholic mother maybe her heart was scared maybe it was because she was on such a high and impossible pedestalmdashconsummate mother good wife allaround paragon of perfect womanhood she was probably up there peering over the side wishing for a ladder a parachute something to get her down from there i hadnrsquot missed going to church on ash wednesday since my father had diedmdashnot once not even when dee was a baby and i had to take her with me stuffing her into a thick papoose of blankets armored with pacifiers and bottles of pumped breast milk i wondered why irsquod kept subjecting myself to itmdashyear after year at the scared heart of mary the priest with his dreary incantation ldquoremember you are dust to dust you shall returnrdquo the blotch of ash on my forehead i only knew i had carried my father this way my whole life hugh was standing now he said ldquodo you want me to tell herrdquo he looked at me and i felt the gathering of dread i imagined a bright wave of water coming down the street rounding the corner where old mrs vandiver had erected a gazebo too close to her driveway the wave not mountainous like a tsunami but a shimmering hillside sweeping toward me carrying off the ridiculous gazebo mailboxes doghouses utility poles azalea bushes a clean ruinous sweep ldquoitrsquos for yourdquo hugh said i didnrsquot move at first and he called my name ldquojessie the callmdashitrsquos for yourdquo he held the receiver out to me sitting there with his thick hair sticking up on the back of his head like a childrsquos looking grave and uneasy and the window copious with water a trillion pewter droplets coming down on the roof
