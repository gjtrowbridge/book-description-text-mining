 one ok i can do this no problem it8217s simply a matter of letting my higher self take over achieving enlightenment and becoming a radiant being of white light easypeasy surreptitiously i adjust myself on my yoga mat so i8217m facing the sun directly and push down the spaghetti straps of my top i don8217t see why you can8217t reach ultimatebliss consciousness and get an even tan at the same time i8217m sitting on a hillside in the middle of sri lanka at the blue hills resort and spiritual retreat and the view is spectacular hills and tea plantations stretch ahead then merge into a deep blue sky i can see the bright colors of tea pickers in the fields and if i swivel my head a little i can glimpse a distant elephant padding slowly along between the bushes and when i turn my head still further i can see luke my husband he8217s the one on the blue yoga mat in the cutoff linen trousers and tatty old top sitting crosslegged with his eyes closed i know it8217s just unbelievable after ten months of honeymoon luke has turned into a totally different person from the man i married the old corporate luke has vanished the suits have disappeared he8217s tanned and lean his hair is long and sunbleached and he8217s still got a few of the little plaits he had put in on bondi beach round his wrist is a beaded bracelet he got in tanzania and in his ear is a tiny silver hoop luke brandon with an earring luke brandon sitting crosslegged as though he can feel my gaze he opens his eyes and smiles and i beam back happily ten months married and not a single row well you know only the odd little one 8220siddhasana8221 says our yoga teacher chandra he8217s a tall thin man in baggy white yoga trousers and he always speaks in a soft patient voice 8220clear your minds of all extraneous thought8221 around me i8217m aware of the eight or nine others in the group moving into position on their mats obediently i place my right foot on my left thigh ok clear my mind concentrate i don8217t want to boast but i find clearing my mind pretty easy i don8217t quite get why anyone would find it difficult i mean not thinking has to be a lot easier than thinking doesn8217t it in fact the truth is i8217m a bit of a natural at yoga we8217ve only been on this retreat for five days but already i can do the lotus and everything i was even thinking i might set up as a yoga teacher when we go back home maybe i could set up a partnership with trudie styler i think in sudden excitement god yes and we could launch a range of yoga wear too all soft grays and whites with a little logo8212 8220focus on your breathing8221 chandra is saying oh right yes breathing breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out breathe8212 god my nails look fab i had them done at the spa8212little pink butterflies on a white background and the antennae are little diamonds they are so sweet except one seems to have fallen off i must get that fixed8212 8220becky8221 chandra8217s voice makes me jump he8217s standing right there gazing at me with this look he has kind of gentle and allknowing like he can see right inside your mind 8220you do very well becky8221 he says 8220you have a beautiful spirit8221 i feel a sparkle of delight all over i rebecca brandon n233e bloomwood have a beautiful spirit i knew it 8220you have an unworldly soul8221 he adds in his soft voice and i stare back totally mesmerized 8220material possessions aren8217t important to me8221 i say breathlessly 8220all that matters to me is yoga8221 8220you have found your path8221 chandra smiles there8217s an odd kind of snorting sound coming from luke8217s direction and i look round to see him looking over at us in amusement i knew luke wasn8217t taking this seriously 8220this is a private conversation between me and my guru thank you very much8221 i say crossly although actually i shouldn8217t be surprised we were warned about this on the first day of the yoga course apparently when one partner finds higher spiritual enlightenment the other partner can react with skepticism and even jealousy 8220soon you will be walking on the hot coals8221 chandra gestures with a smile to the nearby pit of smoldering ashy coals and a nervous laugh goes round the group this evening chandra and some of his top yoga students are going to demonstrate walking on the coals for the rest of us this is what we8217re all supposed to be aiming for apparently you attain a state of bliss so great you can8217t actually feel the coals burning your feet you8217re totally pain free what i8217m secretly hoping is that it8217ll work when i wear sixinch stilettos too chandra adjusts my arms and moves on and i close my eyes letting the sun warm my face sitting here on this hillside in the middle of nowhere i feel so pure and calm it8217s not just luke who8217s changed over the last ten months i have too i8217ve grown up my priorities have altered in fact i8217m a different person i mean look at me now doing yoga at a spiritual retreat my old friends probably wouldn8217t even recognize me at chandra8217s instruction we all move into the vajrasana pose from where i am i can just see an elderly sri lankan man carrying two old carpet bags approaching chandra they have a brief conversation during which chandra keeps shaking his head then the old man trudges away over the scrubby hillside when he8217s out of earshot chandra turns to face the group rolling his eyes 8220this man is a merchant he asks if any of you are interested in gems necklaces cheap bracelets i tell him your minds are on higher things8221 a few people near me shake their heads as though in disbelief one woman with long red hair looks affronted 8220couldn8217t he see we were in the middle of meditation8221 she says 8220he has no understanding of your spiritual devotion8221 chandra looks around the group seriously 8220it will be the same with many others in the world they will not understand that meditation is food for your soul you have no need for sapphire bracelet8221 a few people nod in appreciation 8220aquamarine pendant with platinum chain8221 chandra continues dismissively 8220how does this compare to the radiance of inner enlightenment8221 aquamarine wow i wonder how much8212 i mean not that i8217m interested obviously not it8217s just that i happened to be looking at aquamarines in a shop window the other day just out of an academic interest my eye drifts toward the retreating figure of the old man 8220threecarat setting fivecarat setting he keeps saying all half price8221 chandra shakes his head 8220i tell him these people are not interested8221 half price fivecarat aquamarines at half price stop it stop it chandra8217s right of course i8217m not interested in stupid aquamarines i8217m absorbed in spiritual enlightenment anyway the old man8217s nearly gone now he8217s just a tiny figure on top of the hill in a minute he8217ll have disappeared 8220and now8221 chandra smiles 8220the halasana pose becky will you demonstrate8221 8220absolutely8221 i smile at chandra and prepare to get into position on my mat but something8217s wrong i don8217t feel contentment i don8217t feel tranquillity the oddest feeling is welling up inside me driving everything else out it8217s getting stronger and stronger and suddenly i can8217t contain it anymore before i know what8217s happening i8217m running in my bare feet as fast as i can up the hill toward the tiny figure my lungs are burning my feet are smarting and the sun8217s beating down on my bare head but i don8217t stop until i8217ve reached the crest of the hill i come to a halt and look around panting i don8217t believe it he8217s gone where did he vanish to i stand for a few moments regaining my breath peering in all directions but i can8217t see him anywhere at last feeling a little dejected i turn and make my way back down the hillside to the group as i get near i realize they8217re all shouting and waving at me oh god am i in trouble 8220you did it8221 the redhaired woman8217s yelling 8220you did it8221 8220did what8221 8220you ran over the hot coals you did it becky8221 what i look down at my feet and i don8217t believe it they8217re covered in gray ash in a daze i look at the pit of coals8212and there8217s a set of clear footprints running through it oh my god oh my god i ran over the coals i ran over the burning hot smoldering coals i did it 8220but but i didn8217t even notice8221 i say bewildered 8220my feet aren8217t even burned8221 8220how did you do it8221 demands the redhaired woman 8220what was in your mind8221 8220i can answer8221 chandra comes forward smiling 8220becky has achieved the highest form of karmic bliss she was concentrating on one goal one pure image and this has driven her body to achieve a supernatural state8221 everyone is goggling at me like i8217m suddenly the dalai lama 8220it was nothing really8221 i say with a modest smile 8220just you know spiritual enlightenment8221 8220can you describe the image8221 asks the redhaired woman in excitement 8220was it white8221 someone else chimes in 8220not really white 8221 i say 8220was it a kind of shiny blue green8221 comes luke8217s voice from the back i look up sharply he8217s gazing at me totally straightfaced 8220i don8217t remember8221 i say with dignity 8220the color wasn8217t important8221 8220did it feel like 8221 luke appears to think hard 8220like the links of a chain were pulling you along8221 8220that8217s a very good image luke8221 chimes in chandra pleased 8220no8221 i say shortly 8220it didn8217t actually i think you probably have to have a higher appreciation of spiritual matters to understand8221 8220i see8221 luke nods gravely 8220luke you must be very proud8221 chandra beams at luke 8220is this not the most extraordinary thing you have ever seen your wife do8221 there8217s a beat of silence luke looks from me to the smoldering coals to the silent group and back to chandra8217s beaming face 8220chandra8221 he says 8220take it from me this is nothing8221 after the class is finished everyone heads to the terrace where cool drinks are waiting on a tray but i stay on my mat meditating to show how dedicated i am to higher things i8217m half concentrating on the white light of my being and half imagining running over hot coals in front of trudie and sting while they applaud admiringly when a shadow falls across my face 8220greetings o spiritual one8221 says luke and i open my eyes to see him standing in front of me holding out a glass of juice 8220you8217re just jealous because you don8217t have a beautiful inner being8221 i retort and casually smooth back my hair so the red dot painted on my forehead shows 8220insanely8221 agrees luke 8220have a drink8221 he sits down beside me on the ground and hands me the glass i take a sip of delicious icecold passionfruit juice and we both look out over the hills toward the distant horizon 8220you know i could really live in sri lanka8221 i say with a sigh 8220it8217s perfect the weather the scenery all the people are so friendly 8221 8220you said the same in india8221 luke points out 8220and australia8221 he adds as i open my mouth 8220and amsterdam8221 oh god amsterdam i8217d completely forgotten we went there that was after paris or was it before oh yes it was where i ate all those weird cakes and nearly fell in the canal i take another sip of juice and let my mind range back over the last ten months we8217ve visited so many countries it8217s kind of difficult to remember everything at once it8217s almost like a blur of film with sharp bright images here and there snorkeling with all those blue fish in the great barrier reef the pyramids in egypt the elephant safari in tanzania buying all that silk in hong kong the gold souk in morocco finding that amazing ralph lauren outlet in utah god we8217ve had some experiences i sigh happily and take another sip of juice 8220i forgot to tell you8221 luke produces a pile of envelopes 8220some post came from england8221 i sit up in excitement and start leafing through the envelopes 8220vogue8221 i exclaim as i get to my special subscriber edition in its shiny plastic cover 8220ooh look they8217ve got an angel bag on the front cover8221 i wait for a reaction8212but luke looks blank i feel a tiny flicker of frustration how can he look blank i read him out that whole piece about angel bags last month and showed him the pictures and everything i know this is our honeymoon but just sometimes i wish luke was a girl 8220you know8221 i say 8220angel bags the most amazing hip bags since since 8221 oh i8217m not even going to bother explaining instead i gaze lustfully at the photograph of the bag it8217s made of soft creamy tan calfskin with a transparent resin handle and discreet zipper but what makes it unique is the beautiful winged angel handpainted on the front with the name gabriel underneath in diamant233 there are six different angels gabriel michael dante raphael uriel and ariel all the celebrities have been fighting over them and harrods is permanently sold out holy phenomenon says the headline beside the picture i8217m so engrossed i barely hear luke8217s voice as he holds out another envelope 8220ooze8221 he seems to be saying 8220sorry8221 i look up in a daze 8220here8217s another letter8221 he says patiently 8220from suze8221 8220suze8221 i drop vogue and grab it out of his hand suze is my best friend in the world i have so missed her the envelope is all thick and creamy white and has a crest on the back with a latin motto i always forget how totally grand suze is when she sent us a christmas card it was a picture of her husband tarquin8217s castle in scotland with from the cleathstuart estate printed inside except you could hardly read it because her oneyearold ernie had covered it with red and blue fingerpaints i tear it open and a stiff card falls out 8220it8217s an invitation8221 i exclaim 8220to the christening of the twins8221 i gaze at the formal swirly engraving feeling a slight pang wilfrid and clementine cleathstuart suze has had two more babies and i haven8217t even seen them they must be about two months old by now i wonder what they look like i wonder how suze is doing so much has been going on without us i turn the card over and see that suze has scrawled a message i know you won8217t be able to come but thought you8217d like it anyway hope you8217re still having a wonderful time all our love suzexxx ps ernie loves his chinese outfit thank you so much 8220it8217s in two weeks8221 i say showing luke the card 8220shame really we won8217t be able to go8221 8220no8221 agrees luke 8220we won8217t8221 there8217s a short silence then luke meets my eye 8220i mean you8217re not ready to go back yet are you8221 he says casually 8220no8221 i say at once 8220of course not8221 we8217ve been traveling for only ten months and we planned to be away for at least a year plus we8217ve got the spirit of the road in our feet now maybe we8217ll never be able to go back to normal life like sailors who can8217t go back and live on the land i put the invitation back in its envelope and take a sip of my drink i wonder how mum and dad are i haven8217t heard much from them recently in fact the last time i called home they both seemed a bit distracted mum hardly listened to my story about the elephant orphanage and before i could ask dad how he did in the golf tournament he said he had to go and little ernie will be walking by now i8217m his godmother and i8217ve never even seen him walk anyway never mind i8217m having amazing world experiences instead 8220we need to decide where to go next8221 says luke leaning back on his elbows 8220after we finish the yoga course we were talking about malaysia8221 8220yes8221 i say after a pause it must be the heat or something but i can8217t actually get up much enthusiasm for malaysia 8220or back to indonesia up to the northern bits8221 8220mmm8221 i say noncommittally 8220oh look a monkey8221 i cannot believe i8217ve gotten so blas233 about the sight of monkeys the first time i saw those baboons in kenya i was so excited i took about six rolls of film now it8217s just 8220oh look a monkey8221 8220or nepal or back to thailand 8221 8220or we could go back8221 i hear myself saying out of nowhere how weird i didn8217t intend to say that i mean obviously we8217re not going to go back yet it hasn8217t even been a year luke sits up straight and looks at me 8220back back8221 8220no8221 i say with a little laugh 8220i8217m just joking8221 i hesitate 8220although 8221 there8217s a still silence between us 8220maybe we don8217t have to travel for a year8221 i say tentatively 8220if we don8217t want to8221 luke passes a hand through his hair and the little beads on his plaits all click together 8220are we ready to go back8221 he says 8220i don8217t know8221 i feel a little thrill of trepidation 8220are we8221 i can hardly believe we8217re even talking about going home i mean look at us my hair8217s all dry and sunbleached i8217ve got henna on my feet and i haven8217t worn a proper pair of shoes for months an image comes to my mind of me walking down a london street in a coat and boots shiny highheeled boots by lk bennett and a matching handbag suddenly i feel a wave of longing so strong i almost want to cry 8220i think i8217ve had enough of the world8221 i look at luke 8220i8217m ready for real life8221 8220me too8221 luke takes my hand and weaves his fingers between mine 8220i8217ve been ready for a while actually8221 8220you never said8221 he seemed so into it i8217ve never had an inkling he8217s been bored 8220i didn8217t want to break up the party but i8217m certainly ready8221 8220you would have kept traveling just for me8221 i say touched 8220well it8217s not exactly hardship8221 luke looks at me wryly 8220we8217re hardly roughing it are we8221 i feel a slight flush come to my cheeks when we set off on this trip i told luke i was determined we were going to be real travelers like in the beach and sleep only in little huts that was before i8217d spent a night in a little hut 8220so when we say 8216back8217 82218212luke pauses82128220we are talking london8221 he looks at me questioningly oh god finally it8217s decision time we8217ve been talking for ten months about where we should live after the honeymoon before we got married luke and i were living in new york and i loved it but i kind of missed home too and now luke8217s uk business is expanding into more of europe and that8217s where all the excitement is so he8217d like to go back to london at least for a while which is fine except i won8217t have a job my old job was as a personal shopper at barneys new york and i adored it but never mind i8217m bound to find a new job an even better one 8220london8221 i say decisively and look up 8220so can we be back in time for the christening8221 8220if you like8221 luke smiles and i feel a sudden leap of exhilaration we8217re going to the christening i8217m going to see suze again and my mum and dad after nearly a year they8217ll all be so excited to see us we8217ll have so many stories to tell them i have a sudden vision of myself presiding over candlelit supper parties with all my friends gathered round listening avidly to tales of faraway lands and exotic adventures i8217ll be just like marco polo or someone then i8217ll open my trunk to reveal rare and precious treasures everyone will gasp in admiration8212 8220we8217d better let them know8221 says luke getting up 8220no wait8221 i say grabbing his trousers 8220i8217ve had an idea let8217s surprise them let8217s surprise everybody8221 8220surprise everybody8221 luke looks doubtful 8220becky are you sure that8217s a good idea8221 8220it8217s a brilliant idea everyone loves a surprise8221 8220but 8221 8220everyone loves a surprise8221 i repeat confidently 8220trust me8221 we walk back through the gardens to the main hotel8212and i do feel a slight twinge at the thought of leaving it8217s so beautiful here all teak bungalows and amazing birds everywhere and if you follow the stream through the grounds there8217s a real waterfall we pass the woodcarving center where you can watch craftsmen at work and i pause for a moment inhaling the delicious scent of wood 8220mrs brandon8221 the head craftsman vijay has appeared at the entrance damn i didn8217t know he8217d be around 8220sorry vijay8221 i say quickly 8220i8217m in a bit of a hurry i8217ll see you later come on luke8221 8220no problem8221 vijay beams and wipes his hands on his apron 8220i just wanted to tell you that your table is ready8221 shit slowly luke turns to look at me 8220table8221 he says 8220your dining table8221 says vijay in happy tones 8220and ten chairs i show you we display the work8221 he snaps his fingers and barks some orders and suddenly to my dismay about eight men troop out carrying a huge carved teak table on their shoulders wow it8217s a tad bigger than i remembered luke looks absolutely stunned 8220bring the chairs8221 vijay is bossing the men 8220set it up properly8221 8220isn8217t it lovely8221 i say in superbright tones 8220you ordered a dining table and ten chairs without telling me8221 says luke goggling as the chairs arrive ok i don8217t have many options here 8220it8217s my wedding present to you8221 i say with sudden inspiration 8220it8217s a surprise happy wedding darling8221 i plant a kiss on his cheek and smile hopefully up at him 8220becky you already gave me a wedding present8221 says luke folding his arms 8220and our wedding was a fairly long time ago now8221 8220i8217ve been saving it up8221 i lower my voice so vijay can8217t hear 8220and honestly it isn8217t that expensive 8221 8220becky it8217s not the money it8217s the space this thing8217s a monstrosity8221 8220it8217s not that big and anyway8221 i quickly add before he can reply 8220we need a good table every marriage needs a good table8221 i spread my arms widely 8220after all what is marriage about if not sitting down at the table at the end of the day and sharing all our problems what is marriage if not sitting together at a solid wooden table and and eating a bowl of hearty stew8221 8220hearty stew8221 echoes luke 8220who8217s going to make hearty stew8221 8220we can buy it at waitrose8221 i explain i come round the table and look up at him earnestly 8220luke think about it we8217ll never again be in sri lanka with authentic woodcarvers right in front of us this is a unique opportunity and i8217ve had it personalized8221 i point to the panel of wood running down the side of the table there beautifully carved in among the flowers are the words luke and rebecca sri lanka 2003 luke runs a hand over the table he feels the weight of one of the chairs i can see him relenting then suddenly he looks up with a slight frown 8220becky is there anything else you8217ve bought that you haven8217t told me about8221 i feel a nervous flip inside which i disguise by pretending to examine one of the carved flowers 8220of course not8221 i say at last 8220or you know maybe just the odd little souvenir along the way just here and there8221 8220like what8221 8220i can8217t remember8221 i exclaim 8220it8217s been ten months for goodness8217 sake8221 i look at the table again 8220come on luke you must love it we can have fantastic dinner parties and it8217ll be an heirloom we can hand it down to our children82128221 i break off a bit awkwardly for a moment i can8217t quite look at luke a few months ago we had this huge big discussion and decided that we8217d like to try for a baby but so far nothing8217s happened i mean not that it8217s a big deal or anything it will happen of course it will 8220all right8221 says luke his voice a little gentler 8220you8217ve won me over8221 he gives the table a pat then looks at his watch 8220i8217m going to email the office tell them about our change of plans8221 he gives me a wry look 8220presumably you weren8217t expecting me to burst open the door of the boardroom and yell 8216surprise i8217m back82178221 8220of course not8221 i retort barely missing a beat that is actually kind of what i8217d pictured except i8217d be there too with a bottle of champagne and maybe some party poppers 8220i8217m not quite that stupid8221 i add witheringly 8220good8221 luke grins at me 8220why don8217t you order us some drinks and i8217ll be out in a moment8221 as i sit down at a table on the shady terrace i8217m just a tad preoccupied i8217m trying to remember all the things i8217ve bought and had shipped home without telling luke i mean i8217m not worried or anything it can8217t be that much stuff can it oh god i close my eyes trying to remember there were the wooden giraffes in malawi the ones luke said were too big which is just ridiculous they8217ll look amazing everyone will admire them and there was all that gorgeous batik art in bali which i did intend to tell him about but then kind of never got round to it and there were the twenty chinese silk dressing gowns which ok i know twenty sounds like quite a lot but they were such a bargain luke just didn8217t seem to understand my point that if we bought twenty now they would last us a lifetime and be a real investment for someone who works in financial pr he can be a bit slow off the mark sometimes so i snuck back to the shop and bought them anyway and had them shipped home the thing is shipping just makes everything so easy you don8217t have to lug anything about8212you just point and ship 8220i8217d like that shipped please and that and that8221 and you give them your card and off it goes and luke never even sees it maybe i should have kept a list anyway it8217s fine i8217m sure it8217s fine and i mean we want a few souvenirs don8217t we what8217s the point of going round the world and coming back emptyhanded exactly i see chandra walking past the terrace and give him a friendly wave 8220you did very well in class today becky8221 he says and comes over to the table 8220and now i would like to ask you something in two weeks8217 time i am leading an advanced meditation retreat the others are mainly monks and longterm yoga practitioners but i feel you have the commitment to join us would you be interested8221 8220i8217d love to8221 then i pull a regretful face 8220but i can8217t luke and i are going home8221 8220home8221 chandra looks shocked 8220but you are doing so well you are not going to abandon the path of yoga8221 8220oh no8221 i say reassuringly 8220don8217t worry i8217ll buy a video8221 as chandra walks off he looks a little shellshocked which actually isn8217t surprising he probably didn8217t even realize you could get yoga videos he certainly didn8217t seem to have heard of geri halliwell a waiter appears and i order a beer for luke plus a mango and papaya cocktail which in the menu is called happy juice well that just about suits me here i am in the sunshine on my honeymoon about to have a surprise reunion with all the people i love everything8217s perfect i look up to see luke approaching the table holding his handheld computer is it my imagination or is he walking faster and looking more animated than he has for months 8220ok8221 he says
