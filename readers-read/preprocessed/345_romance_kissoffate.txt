 one summer 1745 richmond england duncan macrae inhaled deeply intoxicated by the rampant scents of summer having arrived in london the night before after a long grueling tour of the continent he would have preferred to spend the day sleeping but his friend lord falconer had insisted on dragging him from london to richmond now duncan was glad he had come as they rounded the corner of their hostesss mansion he scanned the women in gorgeous gowns who drifted across the emerald grass flirting outrageously with even more gorgeous gentlemen quotthe ladies of london are like a bouquet of exotic flowersquot simon malmain smiled lazily quotyoull find no females so exquisite in those wild scottish hills of yoursquot quotscottish lassies are just as lovely and with far less artificequot duncan glanced at the sky quotlady bethany chose her day well britain at its bestquot quotas you know she has some macrae blood enough to always choose a fine day for her entertainments despite our chancy english weatherquot simon lovingly smoothed a wrinkle from his blue brocade sleeve quotif rain threatened id not have worn this new coat it was damnably expensivequot duncan grinned his friend mimicked the manners of a fop so perfectly that even duncan who had known him since the nursery sometimes had trouble remembering that simon was the most dangerous mage in britain except perhaps for duncan himself quotwhere is lady bethany i should pay my respects to our hostess its been years since ive seen herquot simon shaded his eyes to scan the crowd quotover there below the gazeboquot the men turned their steps toward their hostess duncan eyed the lavish refreshment tables with interest but eating must wait upon manners as they neared the gazebo he heard a string quartet inside playing music as lighthearted as the day quotits hard to believe that the shadow of civil war lies over britainquot duncan said softly quotthats why youre herequot simon said with equal softness quotand its why i and others have spent so much time in scotland the future isnt fixed if we guardians build enough bridges between our nations perhaps war can be avertedquot quotperhaps but the scots and the english have been fighting for centuries and such bloody habits are not easily brokenquot duncan gave his friend a slanting glance quotthe first time you and i met we did our best to beat each other unconsciousquot quotyes but that wasnt based on the fact that you were a barbarian scotquot simon said promptly quoti hated you because you were brought to the nursery during my lessons and immediately proved that your greek was better than minequot duncan smiled wryly as he remembered that first encounter quoti suppose thats better than hating each other for our nationalitiesquot the group they were approaching included half a dozen men and women with the rounded figure and silver hair of lady bethany fox in the center though past her seventieth year she had the posture and fine bones that had made her an acclaimed beauty her entire life she was a passionate gardener a doting grandmother and the most powerful sorceress in britain lady bethany laughed at something said by the woman at her side duncan shifted his gaze and stopped dead in his tracks entranced by lady beths companion tall and elegant she wore a creamy gown of modest cut yet her demure garb couldnt disguise a lushly curving figure designed to drive men mad as if that wasnt alluring enough her straw bonnet accented a classically featured face that sparkled with humor and intelligence this was a dangerous woman quotdear godquot he breathed as thunder cracked in the distance quothelen of troyquot quoti beg your pardonquot following duncans gaze simon said quotah lady brecon a lovely lass but launch a thousand ships i think not five or six at the mostquot quotten thousand ships more she is like an ancient enchantress whose glance could drive men to madnessquot duncan gave thanks that lady brecon was unaware of his devouring gaze in the full flower of her womanhood she was so compelling that he could not have looked away to save his life quotlord brecons wife you say the earl has good tastequot quotshes not wife to the present brecon but widow to the old one you were on the continent when they married but it was something of a scandal since she was only seventeen and brecon was over seventy she seemed rather a plain girl at the timequot quotplainquot duncan watched as the lady turned her attention to a languid young fop in gold brocade the pure curve of her throat mesmerized him and that luminous skin begged to be caressed quotherquot quotshe blossomed during the marriagea wealthy husband often has that effect but she and brecon seemed most sincerely devotedquot trust simon to know all the gossip absurdly grateful to learn she was a widow duncan tried to remember when the fifth lord brecon had died a little over a year ago he thought quotshe must have legions of suitors now that shes out of mourningquot quotshe has many admirers me among them but ive never seen her favor any in particularquot simon cocked one brow quoti havent seen you like this since we went to the gypsy horse fair and you spotted that gray hunterquot his friend was right duncan had been sixteen when he saw that horse and his reaction was the same as today when he saw lady brecon he had to have her he drew a slow breath reminding himself that he wasnt sixteen anymore the lady might be a shrew or she might find him as alarming as most women did one might purchase a desirable horse but women were more difficult quotif she was brecons wife she must be a guardianquot quotyes one of the owenses she has no power to speak of but she grew up in the library at harlowe and is a notable scholar of guardian lore since her husband died she lives here in richmond with lady bethanyquot simon grinned quothard to believe theyre sistersinlaw the dowager countess looks like lady bethanys granddaughterquot if the lady was bookish it didnt show from her powdered hair to her dainty slippers she was an exquisite confection designed to ornament the highest social circles thunder sounded again this time closer duncans eyes narrowed directness was out of place in aristocratic london but it was the only way he knew quotintroduce me to the lady simon so i can learn if she is as perfect as she appearsquot gwynne smiled at the appallingly bad sonnet sir anselm white had recited to her though his heart was in the right place his verses were leagues away in the wrong direction quotyou flatter me sir anselm my eyes are light brown not sapphires bluer than the summer sky quot his languid gaze came briefly into focus as he studied the color of her eyes quotgolden coins that outshine the sunquot she guessed that a metaphor had fallen on the poor mans head when he was an infant and he had never recovered since a small amount of sir anselms poetry went a long way she was glad to hear bethany say quotlord falconer how good to see you againquot giving sir anselm a last smile before turning away gwynne greeted the newcomer warmly quotsimon my favorite fopquot she extended her hand quotyouve been neglecting me you roguequot one of the handsomest men in london falconer was always worthy of admiration today his fair hair was tied back with a blue riband the same shade as his brocade coat both an exact match for his azure eyes that embroidered silver waistcoat was more deserving of sonnets than any part of gwynnes body he could give sir anselm lessons in languid eleganceand underneath the elegance he was a glittering blade sheathed in silk quota fopquot he sighed dramatically quotyou wound me my ladyquot he bowed over her hand with consummate grace looking not at all wounded quotallow me to present my friend lord ballister youll have heard of him i think but hes been travelling abroad for some time and says youve never had the opportunity to meetquot all guardians had heard of lord ballister chieftain of the macraes of dunrath among the families he was known as britains finest weather mage some said he was even more powerful than his ancestor adam macrae who had conjured the great gale that destroyed the spanish armada since he stood with the sun behind him she could see little except the silhouette of a powerful commanding figure quotits a pleasure to meet you lord ballisterquot quotthe pleasure is minequot ballister bowed a cloud darkened the sun as he straightened enabling gwynne to see his face clearly his storm gray gaze struck her like lightning destiny the word echoed in her mind along with a dizzying sense that the world had changed irrevocably she scolded herself for too much imagination the world was exactly as it had been the grass was green bethany was composed and falconer his usual exquisite self as for ballister he looked normal enough though his height and broad shoulders drew attention his face was too craggy to be called handsome and his navy blue coat and buff waistcoat were plain by the standards of aristocratic london only his intense gray eyes were remarkable she remembered a natural history demonstration she had once witnessed the lecturer had said that electricity was a wild mysterious force that could not be controlled and which no one understood surely that was electricity in ballisters eyes and in the very air that danced between them she had spent too much time listening to sir anselmhis metaphors were contagious quotyou have been on the continent lord ballisterquot she asked politely quoti arrived back in london only yesterday this morning falconer dragged me from my bed swearing that lady bethany wouldnt mind if i came uninvitedquot quotthe lad would have been in trouble if he hadnt brought youquot bethany said severely quoti hope youll be staying in london for a time ballisterquot quotyes though i do long to return home to scotlandquot after a moments hesitation he said gravely quoti was acquainted with the late lord brecon in learning wisdom and gentlemanliness he was an example to us all despite the time that has passed i hope you will both accept my condolences on your lossquot as lady bethany murmured thanks gwynne swallowed hard unexpectedly moved by his sympathy quotthank you for your kind words i was very fortunate to have shared my lords final yearsquot ballister inclined his head in respectful agreement before saying quotlady bethany may i steal your lovely companion to show me the gardensquot quotplease doquot bethany said her expression thoughtful quotthat will leave me free to flirt outrageously with falconer gwynne be sure to show ballister the parterrequot glad for the chance to talk more with the scotsman she took his arm though she was a tall woman he made her feel small and fragile the parterre was lower on the hill near the river as they crossed the velvety lawn he said quoti understand that you live here with lady bethanyquot quotyes she invited me to join her after brecons deathquot quotit was too difficult to stay on at harlowequot surprised at his understanding she glanced up and was caught by his eyes again the gray was changeable warm now rather than intense quotyes though not because of the new earl and his wife i have the use of the dower house whenever i wish to be at harlowe but lady bethany and i were both in need of companionship so i was pleased to accept her offerquot despite the difference in their ages they had been new widows together it had deepened their existing bond as gwynne and her companion entered the parterre an elaborate pattern of carefully cropped shrubs ballister halted and studied the pattern with narrowed eyes quotthis isnt only decorative is it the pattern is designed to magnify powerquot gwynne automatically glanced around to see if anyone was within earshot the families had survived through the centuries by not drawing unwelcome attention to their abilities to be different was dangerous one of the first things guardian children learned was to preserve secrets never must they mention power in front of outsiders but ballister had been well trained and there was no one near quotyes theres a power point here thats why lady bethany and her husband bought this property the circle in the center of the parterre can be used for ritualsquot quoti can feel the earth energy tugging at me can youquot she knew what he was asking quoti have no real power i can sense atmosphere and energy and emotion a little but no more than any sensitive mundanequot even the happy years of marriage and her acceptance into the guardian community had not eliminated her wistful regret for what she lacked quotwhat of you lord ballister youre called the lord of thunder the lord of storms did your power manifest earlyquot quotnot until i was on the brink of manhood but i always loved weatherthe more dramatic the better when i was barely old enough to walk my mother found me on top of the castle tower in the middle of a thunderstorm my arms flung out to the sky as i howled with laughterquot he smiled reminiscently quoti found that a mothers anger was another kind of tempestquot gwynne laughed quotsince youre a macrae i assume your parents recognized early that you were a weather magequot quotaye it runs in the family and where better for us to learn than in scotland when the weather changes every five minutes with or without a mages helpquot he smiled wryly quotno one even noticed my successes and failures when i was learningquot quoti wonder if the scottish climate is why the best weather workers are always macraesquot quotperhaps there may be something in the air of dunrath that enhances that kind of magicquot he grimaced quotit enhances our weaknesses too the stronger a weather mage the more we are weakened by the touch of iron and a damnable nuisance it is most of the weapons in our armory have hilts of wood or brassquot quotive read about the connection between weatherworking and sensitivity to iron does iron produce a general weakness or does it merely block your powerquot quotit variesquot changing the subject he said quotfalconer told me youre an expert on guardian lorequot quotsince my father was the harlowe librarian i learned early to catalog and read the archives and write essays about obscure facts and correlationsquot she smiled wryly quoti know everything about power except what it feels like to have itquot quotknowledge is as important as powerquot he said seriously quotit is knowledge of history and of our own mistakes that gives us what wisdom we have the work of guardian scholars like you is the framework that helps us fulfill our vowsquot
