 1 so it8217s real simple8221 mouse was saying when he grinned the diamond set in his front tooth sparkled in the gloom cox bar was always dark even on a sunny april afternoon the dim light and empty chairs made it a perfect place for our kind of business 8220 we just be there at about fourthirty in the mornin8217 an8217 wait8221 mouse continued 8220when the mothahfuckahs show up you put a pistol

8220you boys need sumpin8217 for your tongues8221 ginny wright asked there was a leer in the bar owner8217s voice it was a surprise to see such a large woman appear out of the darkness of the empty saloon ginny was darkskinned wearing a wig of goldcolored hair not blond gold like the metal she was asking if we needed something to drink but ginny could make a sexual innuendo out of garlic salt if she was talking to men 8220coke8221 i said softly wondering if she had overheard mouse8217s plan 8220an8217 rye whiskey in a frozen glass for mr alexander8221 ginny added knowing her best customer8217s usual she kept five squat liquor glasses in her freezer at all times8212ready for his pleasure 8220thanks gin8221 mouse said letting his onecarat filling ignite for her 8220maybe we

knew her back then she had a soft spot for the younger mouse all those years now he was her closest friend you got the feeling when she looked at him that she wanted more but ginny satisfied herself by making room in her nest for raymond to do his business on this afternoon she8217d put up her special sign on the front door closed for a private function that sign would stay up until my soul was sold for a bagful of stolen money ginny brought our drinks and then went back to the high table that she used as a bar mouse was still grinning his light skin and gray eyes made him appear wraithlike in the darkness 8220don8217t worry ease8221 he said 8220we got this suckah flatfooted an8217 blind8221 8220all i8217m sayin8217 is that you don8217t know how a man holding a shotgun8217s gonna react

leaned forward and clasped his hands many men who knew my murderous friend would have quailed at that gesture but i wasn8217t afraid it8217s not that i8217m such a courageous man that i can8217t know fear in the face of certain death and raymond 8220mouse8221 alexander was certainly death personified but right then i had problems that went far beyond me and my mortality 8220i ain8217t sayin8217

that8217s all i8217m sayin82178221 i remember his eyebrows rising maybe a quarter of an inch when you8217re facing that kind of peril you notice small gestures i had seen raymond in action he could kill a man and then go take a catnap without the slightest concern the eyebrows meant that his feelings were assuaged that he wouldn8217t have to lose his temper 8220rayford never met me8221 he said sitting back again 8220he don8217t know my name or where i8217m from or where i8217ll be goin8217 after takin8217 the money8221 8220and so why he trust you8221 i asked noticing that i was talking the way i did when i was a young tough in fifth ward houston texas maybe in my heart i felt that the bravado would see me through 8220remembah when i was in the can ovah that manslaughter thing8221 he asked he8217d spent five years in maximum security 8220that was hard time man8221 he said 8220you know i never wanna be back there again i mean the cops would have to kill me before i go back there but even though it was bad some good come out of it8221 mouse slugged back the triple shot of chilled rye and held up his glass i could hear ginny hustling about for his next free drink 8220you know i found out about a very special group when i was up in there it was what you call a syndicate8221 8220you mean like the mafia8221 i asked 8220naw man that8217s just a club this here is straight

diamond was given to him by a rich white movie star that he helped out of a jam 8220here you go baby8221 ginny said placing his frosty glass on the pitted round table between us 8220you need anything

but it didn8217t touch that dryness i took an ice cube into my mouth but it was like i was licking it with a leather strip instead of living flesh 8220how does rayford get paid8221 i asked the words warbling around the ice 8220what you care about him8221 8220i wanna know why we trust him8221 mouse shook his head and then laughed it was a real laugh friendly and amused for a moment he looked like a normal person instead of the supercool ghetto bad man who came off so hard that he rarely seemed ruffled or human at all 8220the man in chi always pick somebody got somethin8217 t8217 hide he gets shit on 8217em and then he pay 8217em for their part up front an8217 he let 8217em know that if they turn rat they be dead8221 it was a perfect puzzle every piece fit mouse had all the bases covered any question i had he had the answer and why not he was the perfect criminal a killer without a conscience a warrior without fear8212his iq might have been off the charts for all i knew but even if it wasn8217t his whole mind paid such close attention to his profession that there were few who could outthink him when it came to breaking the law 8220i don8217t want anybody gettin8217 killed behind
