ada pushed open the tent flaps and searched for knight he had gone out some time ago to chop wood and should have been back by now crawford maurer and galle had left them just one week before and ada was still anxious about being left alone suddenly she saw him several feet away lying on the ground limp and still ada felt her heart rise into her throat as she took a step forward knight couldnt be dead if he were dead she would be all alone and then who would care for her she took another step and another until she was standing over him looking into his pale gaunt face thank god he was breathing she knelt over him and tried to wake him it took a good five minutes or so it seemed to ada but finally he stirred the life coming back into him he woke to see her anxious face pinched and strained peering down at him quotim all right now adaquot his speech was halting his voice soft but he wanted to reassure her because he could tell she was terrified quoti just felt a little faintquot confused and frightened ada pulled him to his feet he leaned heavily on her as she helped him into the tent and once there utterly spent he crumpled into a pile on his bed he began to talk to her then telling her for the first time how ill he was it was scurvy as far as he could tell and it seemed to be getting worse he had tried to keep it from the others but crawford knew and maurer a little but now he could not hide it his mood was gloomy as he lay on his bunk and he told ada that for the first time he was scared quoti guess we shant see nome againquot he said darkly she told him to stay in bed and rest and promised that she would finish chopping the wood she was used to it she said and had done that kind of work at home the last thing knight wanted to do was lie helpless in the tent while ada took care of him but when he found himself too weak to lift his head he consented ada went outside and took up the axe and began cutting the wood afterward she collected snow for their drinking water and then she took the map maurer had left them of his trapline and followed it to his traps to check for foxes as usual there was nothing and she turned back to camp discouraged she had no idea knight was this ill no one had told her why had they not told her she couldnt understand but one thing was clear now she must take care of them until he was strong enough to get out of bed she prayed he would recover enough in a few days to look after her again knight felt the earth spin every time he made a sudden movement and he lost his breath easily he became so winded just lifting a piece of firewood that he had to sit down afterward and catch his breath he didnt remember the severe shortness of breath or the swelling in his legs from the first round of scurvy hed suffered in 1917 he dreamed of fresh meat if only a bear would wander into camp if only he felt strong enough to make it to maurers traps to check for foxes no doubt there would be at least a fox or two found there but he had been afraid to check until he felt better because what if something should happen to him the traps werent terribly far from camp but if he should lose consciousness or have an accident there would be no one there to help him the thought of being helpless did frighten him and he would not take that risk no matter how much he needed the fresh meat he should get up out of his bed and go chop some wood to replenish their stock he needed to gather ice to make drinking water and he needed to go hunting to try to find something for them to eat and to do so many other things quotbut on the least movement especially rapid i am puffing like a freight locomotivequot he recorded he wished crawford and the others would come back because he could see now that it was going to be hard for ada if he became completely bedridden for now she seemed cheerful enough but he wondered how much of it was for show to make him feel better and to make herself feel better he thought she was probably more frightened and distressed about his illness than he was although she wasnt showing it to him he could hear her outside sharpening the wood saw she had told him she would do everything that needed to be done around camp until he felt better and could get up again and take care of everything as he had before and he had no choice but to let her ada was terrified of running into a polar bear while she was out checking the traps she carried a snow knife with her but that was all because she was still frightened of rifles and she knew she wouldnt have the slightest idea how to defend herself if she was caught by nanook while she was out walking she would pause now and then every so often and have a look around for bears knowing she would faint if she so much as caught a glimpse of one she went out every day now looking for food there was nothing at camp and knight was too weak to hunt too weak to do anything but rest in bed ada herself was feeling listless and tired and very much alone she missed crawford and galle and maurer but particularly crawford and galle everything had changed drastically and suddenly when they went away now knight was sick and she must figure out how to help him and what to do to keep them fed and she wished the men would come back and help her she wanted to give up the trapping because there were never any foxes and it made her weary to walk all those miles every single day also daylight hours were still minimal and she worried about being caught in the dark miles from camp but she made herself go out following maurers map until she learned the way herself and one afternoon she spotted some fox tracks circling around the traps and she knelt down and dug the trap out of the snow it was empty and ada figured she must have hidden it under too much snow last time so she baited the trap again leaving it uncovered the next morning when she checked the traps she found a fox lying in one of them her first one ada was proud and exhilarated no one had told her how to fix the trap or to uncover it and leave it in the open she had figured that out on her own and now she would have food to take to knight the very best part of it was that she had done it all herself
