 chapter one declassified all these years i had this nagging feeling these guys wanted their story told bill doran the email was from iris chang author of the groundbreaking bestseller the rape of nanking iris and i had developed a professional relationship after the publication of my first book flags of our fathers in her email iris suggested i contact a man named bill doran in iowa she said bill had some interesting information this was in early february 2001 i was hearing many interesting war stories at that point flags of our fathers had been published recently the book was about the six iwo jima flagraisers one of them was my father indeed scarcely a day passed without someone suggesting a topic for my next book so i was curious as i touched his iowa number on my new york telephone keypad bill quickly focused our call on a tall stack of papers on his kitchen table within twenty minutes i knew i had to look bill in the eye and see that stack i asked if i could catch the first plane out the next day sure ill pick you up at the airport bill offered stay at my place its just me and stripe my hunting dog here i have three empty bedrooms you can sleep in one riding from the des moines airport in bills truck i learned that stripe was the best hunting dog in the world and that his seventysixyear old owner was a retired lawyer bill and stripe spent their days hunting and fishing soon bill and i were seated at his formicatopped kitchen table between us was a pile of paper a bowl of popcorn and two gin and tonics the papers were the transcript of a secret war crimes trial held on guam in 1946 fiftyfive years earlier bill a recent us naval academy graduate had been ordered to attend the trial as an observer bill was instructed to report to the courtroom a huge quonset hut at the entrance a marine guard eyed the twentyoneyearold after finding bills name on the approved list he shoved a piece of paper across a table sign this the marine ordered matteroffactly everybody was required to bill read the singlespaced navy document the legal and binding language informed young bill that he was never to reveal what he would hear in that steaming quonset hut courtroom bill signed the secrecy oath and he signed another copy late that afternoon when he left the trial he would repeat this process every morning and every afternoon for the trials duration and when it was over bill returned home to iowa he kept silent but could not forget what he had heard then in 1997 bill noticed a tiny newspaper item announcing that vast stashes of government documents from 1946 had been declassi fied when i realized the trial was declassified bill said i thought maybe i can do something for these guys now as a lawyer bill had spent his professional life ferreting out documents he made some inquiries and dedicated eleven months to following where they led then one day a boxed transcript arrived in the mail from washington bill told stripe they werent going hunting that day the transcript contained the full proceedings of a trial establishing the fates of eight american airmenflyboysdowned in waters in the vicinity of iwo jima during world war ii each was shot down during bombing runs against chichi jima the next island north of iwo jima iwo jima was coveted for its airstrips chichi jima for its communications stations powerful short and longwave receivers and transmitters atop chichis mount yoake and mount asahi were the critical communications link between imperial headquarters in tokyo and japanese troops in the pacific the radio stations had to be destroyed the us military decided and the flyboys had been charged with doing so a stack of papers my brother found in my dads office closet after his death in 1994 had launched me on a quest to find my fathers past now on bills table i was looking at the stack of papers that would become the first step in another journey on the same day my father and his buddies raised that flag on iwo jima flyboys were held prisoner just 150 miles away on chichi jima but while everyone knows the famous iwo jima photo no one knew the story of these eight chichi jima flyboys nobody knew for a reason for over two generations the truth about their demise was kept secret the us government decided the facts were so horrible that the families were never told over the decades relatives of the airmen wrote letters and even traveled to washington dc in search of the truth wellmeaning bureaucrats turned them away with vague cover stories all those years i had this nagging feeling these guys wanted their story told bill said eight mothers had gone to their graves not knowing the fates of their lost sons sitting at bills table i suddenly realized that now i knew what the flyboys mothers had never learned history buffs know that 22000 japanese soldiers defended iwo jima few realize that neighboring chichi jima was defended by even morejapanese troops numbering 25000 whereas iwo had flat areas suitable for assault from the sea chichi had a hilly inland and a craggy coast one marine who later examined the defenses of both islands told me iwo was hell chichi would have been impossible land troopsmarineswould neutralize iwos threat but it was up to the flyboys to take out chichi the us tried to blow up chichi jimas communications stations for quite some time beginning in june of 1944 eight months before the iwo jima invasion american aircraft carriers surrounded chichi jima these floating airports catapulted steelencased flyboys off their decks into the air the mission of these young airmen was to fly into the teeth of chichi jimas lethal antiaircraft guns somehow dodge the hot metal aimed at them and release their loads of bombs onto the reinforced concrete communications cubes atop the islands twin peaks the wwii flyboys were the first to engage in combat aviation in large numbers in bomber jackets posing with thumbs up they epitomized masculine glamour they were cool and they knew it and any earthbound fool had to know it too their planes were named after girlfriends and pinups whose curvy forms or pretty faces sometimes adorned their sides and inside the cockpit the flyboys were lone knights in an age of mass warfare in the north pacific in 1945 the flyboys flew the original missions impossible climbing into 1940sera tin cans with bombs strapped below their feet they hurtled off carrier decks into howling winds or took off from island airfields sandwiched between blue expanses of sky and sea flyboys would wing toward distant targets dive into flak shot from huge guns and drop their lethal payloads with their hearts in their throats adrenaline pumping through their veins the flyboys then had to deadreckon their way back to a tiny speck of landing deck or to a distant airfield their oftendamaged planes never made it to the flyboys were part of an air war that dwarfed the land war below in 1945 the endgame in the northern pacific was the incineration of japan this required two layers of bombers in the skyhuge b29s lumbering high above with their cargo of napalm to burn cities and smaller lowerflying carrierbased planes to neutralize threats to the b29s my father on iwo jima shared the same mission with the chichi jima flyboys to make the skies safe for the b29s japanese military experts would later agree that the napalm dropped by these b29s had more to do with japans surrender than the atomic bombs certainly napalm killed more japanese civilians than died at hiroshima and nagasaki combined most of the chichi jima flyboys fought and died during the worst killing month in the history of all warfarea thirtyday period in february and march of 1945 when the dying in wwii reached its climax if you look at a graph charting casualties over the four years of the pacific war you will see the line jump dramatically beginning with the battle of iwo jima and the flyboys assaults against mainland japan and few realize the us killed more japanese civilians than japanese soldiers and sailors this was war at its most disturbing intensity it was a time of obscene casualties a time when grandparents burned to death in cities aflame and kamikaze sons swooped out of the sky to immolate themselves against american ships it was the time of the worst battle in the history of the united states marine corps the most decorated month in us history a valorous and brutish time of allout slaughter by february of 1945 logical technocratic american military experts had concluded that japan was beaten yet the empire would not surrender americans judged the japanese to be fanatic in their willingness to fight with no hope of victory but japan was not fighting a logical war japan an island nation existed in its own moral universe enclosed in a separate ethical biosphere japanese leaders believed that japanese spirit was the key to beating back the barbarians at their door they fought because they believed they could not lose and while america cheered its flyers as its best and brightest the japanese had a very different view of those who wreaked havoc from the skies to them airmen who dropped napalm on defenseless civilians living in paper houses were the nonhuman devils this is a story of war so it is a story of death but it is not a story of defeat i have tracked down the eight flyboys brothers and sisters girlfriends and aviator buddies who drilled and drank with them their relatives and friends gave me photos letters and medals i have scoured yearbooks logbooks and little black books to find out who they were and what they mean to us today i read and reread six thousand pages of trial documents and conducted hundreds of interviews in the us and japan the families and friends of the flyboys could only tell me so much their hometown buddies and relatives had stories of their youth and enlistment their military comrades had remembrances from training camp up until they disappeared but none of themnot even the next of kin or the bunkmates who served in the pacific with themknew exactly what happened to these eight on chichi jima it was all a dark hole an unfathomable secret in japan some knew but they had kept their silence i met japanese soldiers who knew the flyboys as prisoners i heard stories about how they were treated about their interrogations about how some of the flyboys had lived among their captors for weeks i met soldiers who swapped jokes with them who slept in the same rooms and i ventured to chichi jima chichi jima is part of an island chain due south of tokyo the japanese call the ogasawara islands on english maps the chain is called the bonin islands the name bonin is a french cartographers corruption of the old japanese word munin which means no man these islands were uninhabited for most of japans existence they literally contained no peoples or no mans so bonin translates loosely into english as no mans land i hacked through forest growth in no mans land to uncover the last days of the flyboys i stood on cliffs with japanese veterans who pointed to where they saw the flyboys parachute into the pacific i strode where flyboys had walked i heard from eyewitnesses who told me much others revealed a great deal by refusing to tell me anything eventually i understood the facts about what happened to dick marve glenn grady jimmy floyd warren earl and the unknown airman i comprehended the what of their fates but to determine the why of their story i had to embark upon another journey a trip back in time back 149 years to another century back to when the first american military men walked in no mans land
