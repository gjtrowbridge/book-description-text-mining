 bradgate hall leicestershire october 1537 my travail begins as i am enjoying a walk in the garden there is a sudden flood of liquid from my womb and then as my maid runs for cloths and assistance a dull pain that shifts from the small of my back to the pit of my stomach soon they are all clustering around me the midwives and the women helping me through the great doorway of the manor house and up the oaken stairs stripping me of my fine clothing and replacing it with a voluminous birthing smock of bleached linen finely embroidered at the neck and wrists now i am made to lie upon my bed and they are pressing a goblet of sweet wine to my lips i don8217t really want it but i take a few sips to please them my two chief ladies sit beside me my gossips whose job it is to while away the tedious hours of labor with distracting chatter their task is to keep me cheerful and to offer encouragement when the pains grow stronger and they do grow stronger less than an hour passes before the dull ache that accompanies each pang becomes a knifelike thrust vicious and relentless yet i can bear it i have the blood of kings in my veins and that emboldens me to lie mute resisting the mounting screams soon god willing i will hold my son in my arms my son who must not die early like the others those tiny infants who lie beneath the flagstones of the parish church neither lived long enough even to sit or crawl i do not account myself a sentimental person indeed i know that many think me too strong and hardwilled for a woman8212a virago my husband once said during one of our many quarrels but hidden within my heart there is a raw place reserved for those two lost babies yet it is natural that this third pregnancy has often led me to revisit this secret place to disturb and probe it gently testing to see if past trage dies still have the power to hurt i know i should forbid myself such weakness i am king henry8217s niece my mother was a princess of england and queen of france i must face the pain of my loss as i do my labor8212with royal dignity refusing to indulge any further in morbid fancies which i am assured by the midwives could well be harmful to the child i carry one must try to be positive and i am nothing if not an optimist this time i feel it in my bones god will give us the son and heir we so desperately desire another hour passes there is little respite between each contraction but the pain is still bearable 8220cry out if you need to my lady8221 says the midwife comfortingly as the women fuss round me with candles and basins of water i wish they would all go away and leave me in peace i wish they would let some fresh air into this fetid stuffy chamber even though it is day the room is dark for the windows have been covered with tapestries and painted cloths 8220we must not risk the babe catching any chills from drafts my lady8221 the midwife warned me when she ordered this to be done then she personally inspected the tapestries to ensure that there was nothing depicted in them that could frighten the child 8220make up the fire8221 she instructs her acolytes as i lie here grappling with my pains i groan it8217s hot enough in here already and i am sweating like a pig but of course she is aware of that at her nod a damp cloth is laid on my brow it does little to relieve my discomfort though for the sheets are wet with perspiration i stifle another groan 8220you can cry out madam8221 the midwife says again but i don8217t i would not make such an exhibition of myself truly it8217s the indignity of it all that bothers me the most conscious as i am of my birth and my rank lying here like an animal straining to drop its cub i8217m no different from any common jade who gives birth there8217s nothing exalted about it i know it8217s blasphemy to say this but god was more than unfair when he created woman men get all the pleasure while we poor ladies are left to bear the pain and if henry thinks that after this i8217m going to something8217s happening dear god what8217s going on sweet jesus when is this going to end the midwife draws back the covers then pulls up my shift to expose my swollen straining body as i lie on the bed knees flexed thighs parted and thrusts expert fingers inside me she nods her head in a satisfied way 8220if i8217m not mistaken this young lad is now in something of a hurry8221 she tells my anxiously hovering ladies 8220ready now8221 she crows triumphantly 8220now push my lady push8221 i gather all my strength breathe deeply and exhale with a great effort knowing that an end is in sight i can feel the child coming i ram my chin into my chest again and push as i am instructed hard and the miracle happens in a rush of blood and mucus i feel a small wet form slithering from me another push and it is delivered into the midwife8217s waiting hands to be quickly wrapped in a rich cloth of damask i glimpse its face which resembles a wrinkled peach i hear the mewling cry that tells me it lives 8220a beautiful daughter my lady8221 announces the midwife uncertainly 8220healthy and vigorous8221 i should be joyful thanking god for the safe arrival of a lusty child instead my spirits plummet all this8212for nothing queen jane seymour hampton court palace surrey october 1537 it has begun this labor that i the king my husband and all england have so eagerly awaited it began with a show of blood then the anxious midwives hurried me into bed fearful in case anything should go wrong indeed every precaution has been taken to guard against mishap since early summer when the babe first fluttered in my womb and i appeared in public with my gown unlaced prayers have been offered up throughout the land for my safe delivery my husband engaged the best physicians and midwives and paid handsomely to have the soothsayers predict the infant8217s sex all promised confidently that it would be a boy an heir to the throne of england henry insisted that i be spared all state appearances and i have spent these past months resting in opulent idleness my every whim and craving gratified he even sent to calais for the quails i so strongly fancied i ate so many i sickened of them most pregnant women i am told sink into a pleasant state of euphoria as their precious burden grows heavier as if nature is deliberately affording them a short respite before the ordeal that lies ahead and the responsibilities of motherhood that follow it but i have enjoyed no such comforting sense of wellbeing or elation at the glorious prospect fac ing me god willing my constant companion is fear fear of the pain of labor fear of what will happen to me if i bear a girl or a dead child as my two unfortunate predecessors did fear of my husband who for all his devotion and care for me is still a man before whom even strong men tremble how he could ever have settled his affections on such a poor plain thing as i is beyond my limited comprehension my women when they dare mention the subject whisper that he loves me because i am the very antithesis of anne boleyn that blackeyed witch who kept him at bay for seven years with promises of undreamedof carnal adventures and lusty sons yet failed him in both respects once he had moved heaven and earth to put the crown on her head i cannot think about what he did to anne boleyn for even though she was found guilty of betraying him with five men one her own brother it is horrifying to know that a man is capable of cutting off the head of a woman he has held in his arms and once loved to distraction and it is even more horrifying when that man is my husband so i live in fear just now i am terrified of the plague which rages in london so virulently that the king has given orders that no one from the city may approach the court confined to my chamber for the past six weeks as is the custom for english queens with only women to wait on me and the imminent birthing to brood on i am prey to all kinds of terrors so in a way it is a relief now to have something real upon which to focus my anxieties henry is not here he has gone hunting as is his wont and passion although he has given me his word that he will not ride more than sixty miles from here i would be touched by his concern had i not learned that it was his council that advised him not to stray farther from me at this time but i am glad all the same that he has gone he would be just one more thing to worry about his obsessive and pathetic need for this child to be a boy is more than i can cope with it is now afternoon and my pains are recurring with daunting intensity even though the midwife tells me that it will be some hours yet before the child can be born i pray god that this ordeal may soon be over and that he will send me a happy hour for i do not think i can stand much more of this
