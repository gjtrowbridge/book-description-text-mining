 chapter excerpt chapter one certain people have said that the world is like a calm pond and that anytime a person does even the smallest thing it is as if a stone has dropped into the pond spreading circles of ripples further and further out until the entire world has been changed by one tiny action if this is true then the book you are reading now is the perfect thing to drop into a pond the ripples will spread across the surface of the pond and the world will change for the better with one less dreadful story for people to read and one more secret hidden at the bottom of a pond where most people never think of looking the miserable tale of the baudelaire orphans will be safe in the ponds murky depths and you will be happier not to read the grim story i have written but instead to gaze at the rippling scum that rises to the top of the world the baudelaires themselves as they rode in the back of a taxi driven by a woman they scarcely knew might have been happy to jump into a pond themselves had they known what sort of story lay ahead of them as the automobile made its way among the twisting streets of the city where the orphans had once lived violet klaus and sunny baudelaire gazed out of the windows of the car marveling at how little the city had changed since a fire destroyed their home took the lives of their parents and created ripples in the baudelaires lives that would probably never become calm as the taxi turned a corner violet saw the market where she and her siblings had shopped for ingredients to make dinner for count olaf the notorious villain who had become their guardian after the fire even after all this time with olaf trying scheme after scheme to get his hands on the enormous fortune the baudelaire parents had left behind the market looked the same as the day justice strauss a kindly neighbor and a judge in the high court had first taken them there towering over the market was an enormous shiny building that klaus recognized as 667 dark avenue where the baudelaires had spent some time under the care of jerome and esm233 squalor in an enormous penthouse apartment it seemed to the middle baudelaire that the building had not changed one bit since the siblings had first discovered esm233s treacherous and romantic attachment to count olaf and sunny baudelaire who was still small enough that her view out the window was somewhat restricted heard the rattle of a manhole cover as the taxi drove over it and remembered the underground passageway she and her siblings had discovered which led from the basement of 667 dark avenue to the ashen remains of their own home like the market and the penthouse the mystery of this passageway had not changed even though the baudelaires had discovered a secret organization known as vfd that the children believed had constructed many such passageways each mystery the baudelaires discovered only revealed another mystery and another and another and several more and another as if the three siblings were diving deeper and deeper into a pond and all the while the city lay calm on the surface unaware of all the unfortunate events in the orphans lives even now returning to the city that was once their home the baudelaire orphans had solved few of the mysteries overshadowing them they didnt know where they were headed for instance and they scarcely knew anything about the woman driving the automobile except her name you must have thousands of questions baudelaires said kit snicket spinning the steering wheel with her whitegloved hands violet who had adroit technical faculties a phrase which here means a knack for inventing mechanical devices admired the automobiles purring machinery as the taxi made a sharp turn through a large metal gate and proceeded down a curvy narrow street lined with shrubbery i wish we had more time to talk but its already tuesday as it is you scarcely have time to eat your important brunch before getting into your concierge disguises and beginning your observations as flaneurs concierge violet asked flaneurs klaus asked brunch sunny asked kit smiled and maneuvered the taxi through another sharp turn two books of poetry skittered off the passenger seat to the floor of the automobile the walrus and the carpenter and other poems by lewis carroll and the waste land by t s eliot the baudelaires had recently received a message in code and had used the poetry of mr carroll and mr eliot in order to decode the message and meet kit snicket on briny beach and now it seemed that perhaps kit was still talking in riddles a great man once said that right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant do you understand what that means violet and sunny turned to their brother who was the literary expert in the family klaus baudelaire had read so many books he was practically a walking library and had recently taken to writing important and interesting facts in a dark blue commonplace book i think so the middle baudelaire said he thinks that good people are more powerful than evil people even if evil people appear to be winning is he a member of vfd you might say that kit said certainly his message applies to our current situation as you know our organization split apart some time ago with much bitterness on both sides the schism violet said yes kit agreed with a sigh the schism vfd was once a united group of volunteers trying to extinguish fires both literally and figuratively but now there are two groups of bitter enemies some of us continue to extinguish fires but others have turned to much less noble schemes
