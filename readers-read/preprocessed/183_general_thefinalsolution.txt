 chapter excerpt chapter one a boy with a parrot on his shoulder was walking along the railway tracks his gait was dreamy and he swung a daisy as he went with each step the boy dragged his toes in the rail bed as if measuring out his journey with careful ruled marks of his shoetops in the gravel it was midsummer and there was something about the black hair and pale face of the boy against the green unfurling flag of the downs beyond the rolling white eye of the daisy the knobby knees in their short pants the selfimportant air of the handsome gray parrot with its savage red tail feather that charmed the old man as he watched them go by charmed him or aroused his sense a faculty at one time renowned throughout europe of promising anomaly the old man lowered the latest number of the british bee journal to the rug of shetland wool that was spread across his own knobby but far from charming knees and brought the long bones of his face closer to the windowpane the tracks a spur of the brightoneastbourne line electrified in the late twenties with the consolidation of the southern railway routes ran along an embankment a hundred yards to the north of the cottage between the concrete posts of a wire fence it was ancient glass the old man peered through rich with ripples and bubbles that twisted and toyed with the world outside yet even through this distorting pane it seemed to the old man that he had never before glimpsed two beings more intimate in their parsimonious sharing of a sunny summer afternoon than these he was struck as well by their apparent silence it seemed probable to him that in any given grouping of an african gray parrot a notoriously prolix species and a boy of nine or ten at any given moment one or the other of them ought to be talking here was another anomaly as for what it promised this the old man though he had once made his fortune and his reputation through a long and brilliant series of extrapolations from unlikely groupings of facts could not could never have begun to foretell as he came nearly in line with the old mans window some one hundred yards away the boy stopped he turned his narrow back to the old man as if he could feel the latters gaze upon him the parrot glanced first to the east then to the west with a strangely furtive air the boy was up to something a hunching of the shoulders an anticipatory flexing of the knees it was some mysterious business distant in time but deeply familiar yes the toothless clockwork engaged the unstrung steinway sounded the conductor rail even on a sultry afternoon like this one when cold and damp did not trouble the hinges of his skeleton it could be a lengthy undertaking done properly to rise from his chair negotiate the shifting piles of ancientbachelor clutter newspapers both cheap and of quality trousers bottles of salve and liver pills learned annals and quarterlies plates of crumbs that made treacherous the crossing of his parlor and open his front door to the world indeed the daunting prospect of the journey from armchair to doorstep was among the reasons for his lack of commerce with the world on the rare occasions when the world gingerly taking hold of the brass doorknocker wrought in the hostile form of a giant apis dorsata came calling nine visitors out of ten he would sit listening to the bemused mutterings and fumblings at the door reminding himself that there were few now living for whom he would willingly risk catching the toe of his slipper in the hearth rug and spilling the scant remainder of his life across the cold stone floor but as the boy with the parrot on his shoulder prepared to link his own modest puddle of electrons to the torrent of them being pumped along the conductor or third rail from the southern railway power plant on the ouse outside of lewes the old man hoisted himself from his chair with such unaccustomed alacrity that the bones of his left hip produced a disturbing scrape lap rug and journal slid to the floor he wavered a moment groping already for the door latch though he still had to cross the entire room to reach it his failing arterial system labored to supply his suddenly skybound brain with useful blood his ears rang and his knees ached and his feet were plagued with stinging he lurched with a haste that struck him as positively giddy toward the door and jerked it open somehow injuring as he did so the nail of his right forefinger you boy he called and even to his own ears his voice sounded querulous wheezy even a touch demented stop that at once the boy turned with one hand he clutched at the fly of his trousers with the other he cast aside the daisy the parrot sidestepped across the boys shoulders to the back of his head as if taking shelter there why do you imagine is there a fence the old man said aware that the barrier fences had not been maintained since the war began and were in poor condition for ten miles in either direction for pitys sake youd be fried like a smelt as he hobbled across his dooryard toward the boy on the tracks he took no note of the savage pounding of his heart or rather he noted it with anxiety and then covered the anxiety with a hard remark one can only imagine the stench flower discarded valuables restored with a zip to their lodging the boy stood motionless he held out to the old man a face as wan and empty as the bottom of a beggars tin cup
