 introduction this book started five years ago when my then fourteenyearold daughter phoebe was alternately throwing up in her school bathroom and starving herself at home somehow at what seemed like warp speed phoebe went from being happy to being miserable from not worrying about her weight to insisting on having two scales in her bathroom and memorizing the calorie count of every morsel of food from not worrying about how she looked to freezing like a deer in the headlights in front of the nearest mirror and asking quotdo i look particularly fat todayquot day after day after day we took phoebe to a therapist who suggested she draw pictures of rainbows i went to a therapist who said quotshes such a beautiful girl how can she have an eating disorderquot my husband and i talked to a psychopharmacologist who said it was probably all biochemical quotoh shes just having a hard time adjusting to a new townto a new schoolto adolescenceto two parents who are never homequot said her school guidance counselor hastily adding quotbut two parents who love her very muchquot phoebe went to an eating disorder clinic where they gave her a healthful diet and told her all about the food pyramid quotcomplex people have complex problemsquot suggested her pediatrician quotjust look at all the depression that runs in our familyquot my sisterinlaw theorized quotits all those sylvia plath books and anne sexton poems shes wallowing inquot warned her teacher and this dubiously positive pronouncement was offered by my mother quotwell she certainly eats a lot for a girl with anorexiaquot phoebe was in crisis i was in crisis our family was in crisis and while her eating disorders slowly got better with time with family therapy with counseling with revelations her body image issues remained phoebe always precocious might have been first on her block to obsess about her looks but soon most of her friends had their own problems too and i gradually realized that most of america is caught up with body image issues theres an absolute epidemic today of beautiful accomplished adolescent girls who are convinced that theyre fat and ugly who believe that looks are everything and that their looks dont measure up to some impossible ideal they are matched by loving and wellmeaning mothers who feel blindsided helpless clueless terrified and guilty sometimes all at once and who invariably have their own unresolved body image issues always a problem solver instant when possible when the problems became overwhelming i read everything i talked to every smart person i could find i got conflicting opinions outdated information misinformation suggestions that might have been helpful if phoebe were ten i read books written in some sort of academic shrinky language i couldnt understand breezy magazine articles that both minimized and oversimplified complex subjects overwrought books with only worstcase scenarios i saw tv shows on body image topics that sensationalized everything i found bits and pieces of what sounded like good advice on the internet but didnt know how reliable the sources were oddly enough it was when i read mary piphers brilliantly insightful reviving ophelia that i felt the most helpless while this was the one book that helped me get an overview and explained the magnitude of the problem after i finished it i still didnt have a clue about what to do with phoebe how was i to respond to her saying quotwill you look at how gross my stomach isquot when her stomach was as flat as a washboard how was i to answer quotwhats wrong with my kneesquot when there was nothing wrong with her knees and when no matter what i said she came back with quotwell you have to say that youre my motherquot where was the book to help mothers like me who need to address body image problems not just understand them where could mothers go for practical advice and straightforward strategies where could mothers get answers to the universal mother questions quotbut what do i do nowquot quotwhat do i say to herquot quothow do i get through to herquot with all due modesty i have to say there is no one less qualified on her own to write a body image book than i am what i do have is a lot more painful experience than i would like to and the right questions lots of them why does a beautiful seemingly happy young girl feel so unbeautiful why does my daughter hate her body why is she so preoccupied with it why does she seem to hate parts of her body quoti hate my feetquot quoti hate my hipsquot quoti hate my buttquot why does she think shes fat when she wears a size two why is her selfesteem based on the circumference of her thighs if shes smart enough to learn ap physics and honors calculus why cant she learn to love herself are we too close or not close enough how do i know am i too concerned and if im feeling this helpless and powerless how can i get help from a husband who seems helpless powerless and clueless are other girls suffering the way my daughter is is every other mother sleeping soundly at night how can i help my daughter when i dont understand her and she wont talk to me why doesnt she take my advice is it a phase will she outgrow it what does it mean who can i blame for her problems barbie kate moss jenny craig the cute varsity football captain shes got a crush on myself is it a question of blame at all do i even have the power to make my daughters problems better or worse after i had all the right questions i looked for someone with answers through some karmic miracle maybe i had suffered enough in this lifetime i found phyllis cohen a new york psychotherapist specializing in adolescents who after thirty years of practice of teaching and writing and lecturing and listening knows how serious and pervasive body image issues are phylliss practice often includes mothers as well as adolescents so she understands these issues from both vantage points she knows that what is crucial to achieving success is the ongoing emotional education of both mothers and daughters and no one is a better teacher than phyllis our shared goal was to write a book of fundamental lessons and advice a book so practical it wouldnt just be read it would be used as a guide a compass and a road map we two speak with one voice for mothers of daughters from thirteen to nineteen to help you help your daughter with the staggering number of body image issues that come up on her radar screen from the moment she wakes up in the morning to the time she goes to bed at night from looks to weight to glossy retouched magazine perfection to cosmetic surgery to disordered eating to eating disorders to mothers on diets to health clubs to makeup to depression to cutting to suicide to cyber relationships to sex to bare midriffs to bikinis to body piercing to mtv to numbers on the scale to sat scores when we told people we were writing a book about body image issues they frequently responded quotoh a book about eating disordersquot body image issues seem to have become synonymous with anorexia bulimia bingeing starving overeating obesity the highly visible area of eating disorders but body image is a much broader idea it is linked to selfimage selfesteem and selfconfidence it is the sense you have of yourself as a person and once you see that body image is a much larger issue you can begin to understand it in a larger and more accurate context the first question to be answered in this book is why so many body image problems exist in the first place many mothers correctly perceive that the passage from childhood to adulthood is a lot more complex for their daughters than it was for them the pressure on adolescent girls is more intense their choices are less clear their reactions are more extreme today getting from twelve to twenty in one sane selfconfident piece is a challenge up there with scaling mount everest the real difficulty lies in the fact that the teenage years are when these girls are defining themselves as individuals these days most of that definition begins and sometimes ends with how they look who they are feels more about whats outside and less about whats inside because they invest so much of their sense of self in their bodies so real problems exist youre not imagining them the next question is how is your daughter likely to deal with these problems shell express her unhappiness through something that has to do with her body or does this sound familiar shell take it out on you so here the two of you are often at loggerheads sometimes friendly and comfortable with each other but more often skirmishing you know how important it is to have a relationship with your daughter the problem is you just cant figure out how to relate you want to talk to her about her school her life her friends and her feelings but if she wants to talk to you at all she wants to talk about her hips too big her hair too wavy her thighs too fat her eyes too whatever somehow all you have in common is the fact that you cant talk to each other and if you ever swore to yourself that you would never behave toward your daughter the way your mother behaved toward you this is probably the point where you find yourself doing exactly that and with no more success than your mother had a first piece of advice do not despair do not give up do not think its too late to make it better or do it differently know that in the course of helping your daughter develop a healthy body image you will experience as many highs as lows as much laughter as tears have faith that you and your daughter can have a mutually satisfying relationship and that you can effect positive changes why because you and your daughter love each other you need each other and you both need a relationship that works it may feel as though the girl you once loved is gone along with all the familiar ties that connected the two of you but be reassured the motherdaughter bond that was formed when your daughter was an infant is still strong no matter how deeply it may be buried under all the conflicts that have grown between you the connection is still there and always will be and you can find it when you start to look for it once you recover that bond you will be able to do two vital things start listening to your daughter and start learning from her at the same time this connection will help your daughter start to learn more about you as a person and to listen to what you have to say this genuine mutual communication is the basis for a loving supportive relationship to even begin to take a first positive step you need to stop feeling guilty about everything stop blaming either your daughter or yourself for every argument that results from your daughters hating her body from your saying something critical to her from her saying something mean to you and no matter how many times she tells you that you dont do anything right no matter how meanspirited or verbally abusive she is do not come away concluding quotshes right i cant do or say anything right shes impossible to understand she hates me i give upquot you are doing lots of things right and youll do more so dont devalue yourself for your daughter its all about testing shes testing limits shes testing reality shes testing your love shes testing your acceptance or rejection of who she is and shes testing body boundaries while shes being hysterical hateful and horrible you need to be firm as the grownup in the relationship its your job to set boundaries while youre setting limits about her body remember that its her body not yours if shes doing something risky like having promiscuous sex abusing drugs bingeing and purging or yoyo dieting then you must intervene otherwise respect her boundaries to help make all of this less abstract throughout the book well give you what you need steps strategies suggestions and templates basically your job is to figure out what isnt working and why to find ways to better understand and connect with your daughter ours is to give you the tools to do this if we do our job and you do yours well reach our shared goal your daughter will have a positive body image youll have your life back two disclaimers phoebe inspiration and intelligent reader points out that in her opinion this book occasionally reads like one of those public television nature shows where the announcer intones quotthe young female is apt to be skittish if not dangerous she stays close to her pack and resists any attempt to lure her out of the bushquot we ask any girl who reads the book to understand that we dont mean to talk about her as if she were a young gazelle or zebra the other disclaimer is that phoebe expert critic and stickler for accuracy also points out that although were not adolescent girls ourselves we presume to speak for them and to know everything theyre thinking and saying we feel strongly that we have captured both the spirit and the essence of these girls without misrepresenting them but the nature of a book like this is to universalize generalize and make some assumptions we do presume smart readers if you and your daughter and phoebe dont take it totally literally this book will make more sense
