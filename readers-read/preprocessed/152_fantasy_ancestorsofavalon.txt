 tiriki was losing focus again if it was all the same she thought in sudden rebellion we wouldnt be here now for months news of earthquakes and rumors of worse destruction to come had been running like wildfire throughout the sea kingdoms in ahtarrath such terrors had at first seemed distant but the past few nights temple dwellers and city folk alike had been plagued by faint tremors in the earth and persistent dreadful dreams and even now as the song continued she could sense uneasiness in the other singers can this truly be the prophesied time of ending tiriki wondered silently after so many warnings resolutely she rejoined her voice to the rising architecture of sound whose manipulation was perhaps the most powerful tool of atlantean magic moving we become more still impassioned we are bound by will turning in perpetuity while time becomes eternity the shadows thickened contorting the swirls of incense that at last spiraled into the chill air the music stopped light blazed forth from the stone filling the shrine as completely as darkness had before light was everywhere so radiant that tiriki was surprised to find that it carried no heat even the torches shone more brightly the singers released a collective sigh now they could begin first to take off his hood and move toward the stone was reiota governor of the temple beside him the bluerobed mesira leader of the healers lifted her veil tiriki and micail stepped out to face them across the stone in that light micails red hair shone like flame while the wisps that escaped tirikis coiled braids glistened gold and silver reiotas rich tenor took up the invocation in this place of niterat dark queen of earth now bright with the spirit of manoahs light confirm we now the sacred center the omphalos navel of the world the richness of her husky contralto belied mesiras age the center is not a place but a state of being the omphalos is of another realm many ages the stone lay undisturbed in the sanctuaries of the ancient land but the center was not there nor is it in ahtarrath micail voiced the formal response mindful that all here have vowed that what is is worth preserving and to that end bending might and will he smiled at tiriki and reached again for her hand together they drew breath for the closing words we arrive forever in the realm of the true which can never be destroyed and the rest responded in chorus while we keep faith light lives in us the otherworldly illumination throbbed as mesira spoke once more so we invoke the equilibrium of the stone that the people may know peace once more for we cannot ignore the portents we have seen we meet in a place of wisdom to seek answers seeress i summon thee151 mesira extended both arms to the grey figure who now stepped forward the time is come be thou our eyes and our voice before the eternal the seeress drew back her veils in the intense brilliance of the stones light it was not difficult to recognize alyssa her black hair hanging loose around her shoulders her eyes already dilated by trance with strange halfbowing steps she moved into the altars radiance the singers watched nervously as the seeress rested her fingertips upon the stone translucent patterns of power pooled and eddied within alyssa stiffened but instead of retreating she moved even nearer it isit is so she whispered one with the stone am i what it knows ye shall know let the sacred song bear us to the doors of fate as she spoke the singers began to hum softly micails voice soared in the cadence of command calling the seeress by her temple name neniath seeress dost thou know me i osinarmen do address thee part us from dreams as thou dost wake by the answer thou wilt make i hear the voice was quite different from alyssas sharp and ringing i am here what wouldst thou know speak if it please thee and we shall attend micail sang the formal phrase in one sustained exhalation but in his voice tiriki could hear the strain we come because the stone has called us whispering secretly in the night a moment passed the answer thou dost already know the seeress murmured the question lies before the truth yet the door that was cast open will not be shut stone upon stone rises higher doomed to fall the forests fill with tinder the power which has waited at the heart of the world shiftsand it hungers tiriki felt a momentary unsteadiness but could not tell if it came from beneath the flooring stones or from her own heart she looked to micail but he stood frozen his face a grimacing mask reiota forced out words darkness has broken loose before he said with grim concentration and always it has been contained what must we do this time to bind it can you do aught but sing again while silence grows alyssa shook with unexpected bitter laughter and this time the earth shuddered with her a ripple of fright shook the singers they cried out as one we are servants of light unfailing the darkness can never prevail but the tremors did not cease the torches flickered out scarlet lightnings shot from the stone for a moment tiriki thought the cavern around them was groaning but it was alyssas throat from which those horrific sounds came the seeress was speaking or trying to but the words came garbled and unintelligible fighting their dread the singers inched closer to alyssa straining to hear but the seeress shrank away from them arms flailing against the stone it climbs her shrieks echoed far beyond the circular chamber the foul flower blood and fire you are too late as the echoes diminished the strength faded from the taut body of the seeress only micails swift movement prevented her from falling take her151 reiota gasped mesira go with them we will ffinish here151 nodding micail bore the seeress from the chamber x the alcove by the entrance to the shrine where they brought the seeress seemed strangely quiet while the earth beneath them had finally stilled tirikis spirit was still shaken as she entered her acolyte damisa who had waited here with the other attendants during the ceremony looked up with anxious green eyes micail pressed past her touching tirikis hand in a swift caress that was more intimate than an embrace eyes met in an unspoken assurance151 i am herei am here we will survive though the heavens fall from the chamber beyond came a babble of voices how are they murmured micail with a nod toward the sound tiriki shrugged but held on to his hand half of them are assuring one another that we did not understand alyssas words and the others are convinced that ahtarra is about to fall into the sea reiota will deal with them she looked at alyssa who lay upon a bench with mesira beside her how is she the face of the seeress was pale and the long hair which this morning had shone like a ravens wing was now brindled with streaks of grey she sleeps mesira said simply in the soft light that came through the doorway the healers face showed all its years as for her wakingit will be some time i believe before we know whether this days work has harmed her you may as well go i think we have received all the answers we are going to get my chela is fetching a litter that we may take her back to the healers hall if there is any change i will send word micail had already removed his vestments and slipped the emblem of his rank beneath the neck of his sleeveless tunic tiriki folded her veil and outer robe and handed them to damisa shall we too call for bearers she asked micail shook his head are you up to walking i need to feel the touch of honest daylight on my skin x the hot bright air of the outdoors was a blessing baking the chill of the underground chambers from their bones tiriki felt the tightness easing from her neck and shoulders and lengthened her steps to keep up with her husbands longer stride through the red and white stone columns of the temple that marked the entrance to the underground shrine she glimpsed a string of roofs tiled in blue farther down the slope a scattering of newly built domes in cream and red were set amid the gardens of the city beyond them the glittering sea stretched away to infinity as they emerged from the portico the sounds and smells of the city rose around them151barking dogs and crying babies merchants calling out their wares the spicy smell of the seafood stew that was a local favorite and the less salubrious odors from a nearby sewer the fires started by last nights quake had been put out and the damage was being dealt with the destruction had been less than they had feared indeed fear was now their greatest enemy even the stinks were an affirmation of ordinary life reassuring after their confrontation with the uncanny power of the stone perhaps micail felt the same at any rate he was leading her the long way around away from the tall buildings of the temple complex and down through the marketplace instead of following the whitepaved processional way that led to the palace the gleaming flanks of the three towers were hidden as they turned down a side street that led toward the harbor where shopkeepers haggled with customers as they would on any normal day they attracted a few looks of admiration but no one pointed or stared without their ritual robes she and micail looked like any ordinary couple doing errands in the marketplace though they were taller and fairer than most of the people of the town and had anyone considered troubling them the decision in micails strong features and the energy in his stride would have been deterrent enough are you hungry she asked they had fasted for the ritual and it was now close to noon what i really want is a drink he responded with a grin there used to be a taverna near the harbor that served good wine151not our local rough red but a respectable vintage from the land of the hellenes dont worry151the food will not disappoint you either the taverna had an open loggia shaded by trellised vines around its edges grew the crimson lilies of ahtarrath their delicate fragrance scented the air tiriki tipped back her head to allow the breeze from the harbor to stir her hair if she turned she could see the slopes of the star mountain151the dormant volcano that was the islands core shimmering in the heathaze down the slope there was a band of forest and then a patchwork of field and vineyard sitting here the events of the morning seemed no more than gloomy dreams micails fathers had ruled here for a hundred generations what power could overwhelm a tradition of such wisdom and glory micail took a long swallow from his earthenware goblet and let out a breath with an appreciative sigh tiriki was surprised to feel a bubble of laughter rising within at the sound her husband lifted one eyebrow for a moment you reminded me of rajasta she explained micail grinned our old teacher was a noble spirit but he did appreciate good wine he has been in my mind today as well but not because of the wine he added sobering she nodded agreeing ive been trying to remember all he told us of the doom that claimed the ancient land when the land began to sink they had warning enough to send the sacred scrolls here along with the adepts to read them but if disaster should destroy all the sea kingdomswhere would a refuge for the ancient wisdom of atlantis be found micail gestured with his goblet is it not for that very purpose that we send out emissaries to the eastern lands of hellas and khem and north as far as the amber coast and the isles of tin and what of the wisdom that cannot be preserved in scrolls and tokens she mused what of those things that must be seen and felt before one can understand and what of the powers that can be safely given only when a master judges the student to be ready for them what of the wisdom that must be transmitted soul to soul micail frowned thoughtfully but his tone was relaxed our teacher rajasta used to say that however great the cataclysm if only the house of the twelve was preserved151not the priesthood but the six couples the youths and maidens who are the chosen acolytes151by themselves they could recreate all the greatness of our land and then he would laugh he must have been joking said tiriki thinking of damisa and kalhan elis and aldel kalaran and selast and elara and cleta and the rest the acolytes had been bred to the calling the offspring of matings ordained by the stars their potential was great151but they were all so terribly young tiriki shook her head no doubt they will surpass us all when they complete their training but without supervision i fear they would find it hard to resist the temptation to misuse their powers even my father151 she stopped abruptly her fair skin flushing most of the time she was able to forget that her real father was not reiota her mothers husband but riveda who had ruled over the order of grey robe mages in the ancient land riveda who had proved unable to resist the temptations of forbidden magic and had been executed for sorcery even riveda did good as well as evil micail said softly taking her hand his soul is in the keeping of the lords of fate and through many lifetimes he will work out his penance but his writings on the treatment of sickness have saved many you must not let his memory haunt you beloved here he is remembered as a healer a darkeyed youth arrived with a platter of flat cakes and little crisply fried fishes served with goat cheese and cut herbs his eyes widened a little as he took in tirikis blue eyes and fair hair her only legacy from riveda who had originally come not from the ancient land but from the littleknown northern kingdom of zaiadan we must try not to be afraid micail said when the servant had gone there are many prophecies other than rajastas that speak of the time of ending if it has come we will be at great risk but the foreshadowings have never suggested that we are wholly doomed indeed rajastas vision has assured us that you and i will found a new temple in a new land i am convinced that there is a destiny that will preserve us we must only find its thread tiriki nodded and took the hand he held out to her but all this bright and beautiful life that surrounds us must pass away before the prophecy can be fulfilled but for now the day was fair and the aromas rising from her plate offered a pleasant distraction from whatever fate might have in store willing herself to think only of the moment and of micail tiriki sought for a more neutral subject did you know that elara is a fine archer micail raised an eyebrow that seems an odd amusement for a healer151shes apprenticed to liala is she not yes she is but you know that a healers work requires both precision and nerve elara has become something of a leader among the acolytes i would have expected the alkonan girl151your acolyte damisa151to take that role he replied isnt she the oldest and shes some relation to tjalan i believe that family does like to take charge he grinned and tiriki remembered that he had spent several summers with the prince of alkonath perhaps she is a little too aware of her royal background in any case she was the last of them to arrive here and i think shes finding it hard to fit in if that is the hardest thing she has to deal with she may count herself fortunate micail downed the last of his wine and got to his feet tiriki sighed but indeed it was time for them to go when the innkeeper realized that the couple who had been occupying the best table on his terrace for so very long were the prince and his lady he tried to refuse payment but micail insisted on impressing his signet on a bit of clay present that at the palace and my servants will give you what i owe151 you are too kind tiriki jested softly as they were at last permitted to leave the taverna the man plainly felt honored by a visit from the prince and wished to make you a gift in return why did you not allow it think of it as an affirmation micail smiled a little grimly that bit of clay represents my belief that someone will be here tomorrow and if as you say he would prefer the honor well there is nothing to force him to redeem the debt memory fades but he has my seal for a keepsake151 slowly they walked back to the palace speaking of ordinary things but tiriki could not help recalling how the screams of the seeress had echoed from the crypt x when damisa returned to the house of the falling leaves the other acolytes were just finishing a lesson elara of ahtarrath was the first to see her come in elara darkhaired and buxom was a native of this island and it had fallen to her to make the newcomers from the other sea kingdoms welcome as they arrived on each island the temples trained priests and priestesses but from among the most talented young people in each generation twelve were chosen to learn the greater mysteries some would one day return to their own islands as senior clergy while others explored specialties such as healing or astrology from the twelve came the adepts who served all atlantis as vested guardians in the temple of light the house was a low sprawling structure of oddly aligned corridors and oversize suites rumored to have been built a century or more ago for a foreign dignitary the acolytes often amused themselves with suggesting other explanations for the stone mermaids in the weathered fountain in the central courtyard whatever its origins until quite recently the strange old villa had served as a dormitory for unmarried priests pilgrims and refugees now it was the house of the twelve some of the acolytes welcomed elaras help while others resisted her but damisa who was a cousin of the prince of alkonath was usually the most selfsufficient of them all right now thought elara she looked terrible damisa what has happened to you are you ill she flinched as the other girl turned to her with a blind stare did something happen at the ceremony elara took a firm grip on damisas elbow and made her sit down by the fountain she turned to get the attention of one of the others lanath go get her some water elara said in a low voice as all the acolytes surrounded them elara sat down pushing back the black curls that kept falling into her eyes be quiet all of you she glared until they moved back let her breathe she knew that damisa had been called to attend lady tiriki early that morning and she had envied her elaras role as chela to the blue robe priestess liala in the temple of niterat was a pleasant enough assignment but hardly glamorous the acolytes had been told that their apprenticeships were determined by the placement of their stars and the will of the gods it made sense that elaras betrothed lanath was assigned to the temple astrologer because he had a good head for figures but elara had always suspected that damisas royal connections had got her the place with tiriki who was not only a priestess but princess of ahtarrath after all but she did not envy damisa now tell us damisa she murmured as the other girl drank was someone hurt has something gone wrong wrong damisa closed her eyes for a moment then straightened and looked around the circle havent you heard the rumors that have been going around the city of course we have but where were you asked little iriel at an equinox ritual attending my lady damisa replied those rituals are usually held in the great temple of manoah observed elis who was also a native of the city it wouldnt take you this long to get back from there we werent at the temple of light damisa said tightly we went to another place a sanctuary built into the cliffs at the eastern edge of the city the portico looks ordinary enough but the actual temple is deep underground or at least i suppose so i was told to wait in the alcove at the head of the passage banurs bones elara exclaimed thats the temple of151i dont know what it is151no one ever goes there i dont know what it is either damisa responded with a return of her usual arrogance but some power is down there i could see odd flashes of light all the way up the passageway its the sinking said kalaran in a dull voice my own island is gone and now this one is going to go too my parents migrated to alkonath but i was chosen for the temple they thought it was an honor for me to come here the acolytes looked at one another shaken we dont know that the ritual failed elara said bracingly we must wait151we will be told151 they had to carry the seeress out of that chamber damisa interrupted she looked half dead theyve taken her to liala and the healers at the house of niterat i should go there said elara liala may need my assistance why bother glowered lanath were all going to die be still elara rounded on him wondering what had possessed the astrologers to betroth her to a boy who would run from his own shadow if it barked at him all of you151calm down we are the chosen twelve not a pack of backcountry peasants do you think our elders have not foreseen this disaster and made some kind of plan our duty is to help them however we can she pushed her dark hair back again hoping that what she had said was true and if they havent asked damisas betrothed a rather stodgy brownhaired lad called kalhan then we will die damisa recovered herself enough to scowl at him well if we do said little iriel with her irrepressible smile i am going to have a few strong words to say to the gods x when micail and tiriki returned to the palace they found a bluerobed priestess waiting at the gate bearing news from mesira alyssa had awakened and was expected to make a good recovery if only tiriki thought darkly we could do so well at healing her prophecy yet she kept a smile on her lips as she accompanied micail upstairs to the suite of rooms they shared on the upper floor the veil before the alcove that held the shrine to the goddess and the hangings that curtained the doors to the balcony stirred in the night wind from the sea the whitewashed walls were frescoed with a frieze of golden falcons above a bed of crimson lilies in the flickering light of the hanging lamps the birds soared and the flowers seemed to bend in an invisible breeze when he had changed into a fresh robe micail went off to confer with reiota left alone tiriki ordered softfooted servants to fill her bath with cool scented water when she had bathed they waited to pat her dry when they had gone she walked out onto the balcony and gazed at the city below to the east the star mountain loomed against the crisp night sky groves of cypress covered the lower slopes but the cone rose sharply above the perpetual flame in the temple at its summit appeared as a faint pyramidal glow scattered points of light marked outlying farmsteads on the lower slopes dimming one by one as the inhabitants sought their beds in the city folk stayed up later bobbing torches moved along the streets in the entertainment quarter as the air cooled the land gave up scents of drying grass and freshly turned earth like a rich perfume she gazed out upon the peace of the night and in her heart the words of the evening hymn became a prayer151 oh source of stars in splendor against the darkness showing grant us restful slumber this night thy blessing knowing how could such peace such beauty be destroyed her bed was hung with gauze draperies and covered with linen so fine it felt like silk against the skin no comfort that ahtarrath could provide was denied her but despite her prayer tiriki could not sleep by the time micail came to bed it was midnight she could feel him gazing down at her and tried to make her breathing slow and even just because she was wakeful was no reason he should be deprived of sleep as well but the bond between them went beyond the senses of the flesh what is wrong beloved his voice was soft in the darkness she let out her breath in a long sigh i am afraid but we have known ever since we were born that doom might come to ahtarrath yes151at some time in the distant future but alyssas warning makes it immediate perhapsperhaps the bed creaked as he sat down and reached to caress her hair still you know how hard it is to know the timing of a prophecy tiriki sat up facing him do you truly believe that belovednone of us can know what our knowing may change all we can do is to use what powers we have to face the future when it comes he sighed and tiriki thought she heard an echo of thunder although the night was cloudless ah yes your powers she whispered bitterly for what use were they now you can invoke the wind and the lightning but what of the earth beneath and how will that be passed on if all else falls reiota has only a daughter151and i151i am unable to bear you a child sensing her tears he clasped her closer to him you have not done so151but we are still young tiriki let her head rest against his shoulder and relaxed into the strength of his arms drawing in the faint spicy scent of his body mixed with the oils of his own bath two babes have i laid upon the funeral pyre she whispered and three more i lost before they could be born the priestesses of caratra have no more help for me micail she felt her hot tears welling up as his arms tightened around her our mothers were sisters151perhaps we are too close kin you must take another wife my beloved one who can give you a child she felt him shake his head in the darkness the law of ahtarrath allows it she whispered and the law of love he asked he grasped her shoulders looking down at her she felt rather than saw the intensity in his gaze to beget a son worthy to bear my powers i must give not only my seed but my soul truly beloved i do not think i would even be151capable151with a woman who was not my match in spirit as well as in body we were destined for each other tiriki and there can never be anyone for me but you she reached up to trace the strong lines of his cheek and brow but your line will end he bent his head to kiss away her tears if ahtarrath itself must cease to be does it matter so greatly if the magic of its princes is lost as well it is the wisdom of atlantis we must preserve not its powers osinarmendo you know how much i love you she lay back with a sigh as his hands began to move along her body each touch awakening a sensation to which her body had learned to respond as the spiritual exercises of the temple had trained her soul eilanthaeilantha he answered and closed his arms around her at that summons spirit and body opened together overwhelmed and transfigured in the ultimate union
