 how the devil did they break the mill gervase tregarth 6th earl of crowhurst paced before the hearth in the elegant drawing room of crowhurst castle the exasperation of a man driven to the limits of frustration colored his face tone and every longlegged stride and am i to surmise that they were also behind all the rest the broken fences the damaged boats the mixup with the grain the unexplained ringing of the church bells at midnight swinging around he pinned his stepmother sybil with a sharply interrogatory hard hazel gaze seated on the chaise a silk shawl about her shoulders sybil returned his stare with a blank look as if she hadnt fully comprehended his meaning gervase knew better sybil was wondering how to answer she knew he was one step away from losing his temper and would much rather he didnt he narrowed his eyes even further they were werent they of course they were his voice had lowered to a growl the past months of futile traveling to london only to be summoned back within a few days to deal with some inexplicable calamity flashed across his mind8212and frayed the reins of his temper even more what in all creation do they think theyre about he wasnt shouting but the force behind his words was enough to overset a more robust female than sybil he drew in a breath and tamped down his welling fury the they he and she were discussing were her daughters8212his three halfsisters8212currently featuring as the bane of his life belinda annabel and jane took after their father as did he which was why sybil mild sweet sybil fairhaired and gentle was entirely unable to control them or comprehend them all three were more intelligent clever and quick than she they were also more vigorous bold and outgoing altogether more confident he on the other hand shared with the three the affinity of character theyd always been close as their adored older and only brother hed grown accustomed to them being on his side or at least operating on some form of tregarth logic he could understand instead over the past six months theyd apparently transformed from lovable if mischievous hoydens of whom he was deeply fond to secretive demoninspired harpies whose primary focus in life was to drive him demented his last question had thus been rhetorical if he couldnt fathom what had possessed his dear sisters to stage what amounted to six months of guerrilla mayhem designed to overthrow his sanity he didnt imagine sybil would yet to his surprise she looked down and picked at her shawls fringe actually she strung the word out then glanced up at him i think its because of what happened to the hardesty girls the hardesty girls he halted frowned struggling to place them the hardestys of helston grange sybil nodded robert hardesty8212lord hardesty now his father is dead8212went to london last september and came home with a wife gervases recollection of robert hardesty was of a wetbehindtheears whelp but that memory was more than twelve years old robert must be what twentyfive twentysix i believe a trifle young for marriage perhaps yet if as i suppose he has his sisters to establish a wife seems a sensible addition to his household his sisters futures rated as one of the many reasons he himself felt compelled to wed gervase tried to recall the hardesty girls but drew a blank his sisters are about belindas age arent they a year or two older8212eighteen and seventeen everyone thought melissa and katherine would be presented this past season and with robert marrying well we all imagined that the new lady hardesty8212a young widow said to have been a london beauty8212would naturally take the girls under her wing from sybils tone it was clear the generally held expectations hadnt been met what happened robert brought his lady home just before christmas sybils rosebud lips tightened into an expression of severe disapprobation in january with the snows still blocking the roads robert dispatched melissa and katherine to visit their aunt in york it seemed his new wife wanted time to settle into her new life without the distraction of having to deal with the girls however its now july and the girls are still in york meanwhile lady hardesty spent the season in london then returned to the grange a week ago with a bevy of london friends in tow i understand shes told robert that it would not be wise to have the girls return home while they have so many london gentlemen under their roof gervase stood before the fireplace staring at sybil while he grappled with the implied connection then he blinked am i to understand lifting his head he looked past sybil trying to see the hardesty story from his sisters perspective they cant possibly be equating me with robert hardesty his tone made it clear he found the notion inconceivable he refocused on sybils face in time to meet her widening eyes well of course they are dear the parallels are rather obvious he felt his face harden no theyre not he paused then growled good god they cant seriously imagine8212 he broke off and looked toward the main door as it opened to admit his halfsisters hed sent for them the instant hed stalked into his front hall having been met in the castle forecourt by gregson the local bailiff with the news that the three had been discovered creeping away from the mill just after midnight subsequently it had been discovered that the mill was no longer functional despite the best efforts of the miller it still wasnt in the wake of the string of strange accidents that had plagued the estate for the past six months gervase and gregson had set up a secret watch but the very last culprits theyd expected to catch were the three schoolgirls who marched into the room
