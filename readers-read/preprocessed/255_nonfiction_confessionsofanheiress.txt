 chapter one how to be an heiress a lot of people seem to have the wrong idea about me in fact pretty much everything i read about myself is totally ridiculous newspapers and magazines write that im spoiled and privileged and that all i do is dance on tabletops and party with my friends they think i instantly became famous because i was born into a rich wellknown family and everything has come so easily to me they like to think everything they read about me in the tabloids is true well you cant always believe what you read right so ive finally decided to give you a sneak peek into my very hyped life so you can know the real me i havent bothered to correct whats been written about me so far because well gossips believe whatever they want anyway the people i care about know the real me if im happy with who i am what difference does it make and thats the bottom line for me while the stuff printed about me over the last few years is amusing and makes me laugh ive finally decided to let the world know okay i get it everyone can have fun with my image because i like to have fun with it too my friends know that while i like my lifestyle i dont take it or my media image all that seriously i do take my family seriously i take my dog tinkerbell seriously i take my work seriously but i dont take myself all that seriously now i have to confess to you despite what youve read being a famous heiress is not that easy it is of course fun and exciting and it comes in handy for air travel but look around you and in the gossip columns not every heiress is famous or fun there are a lot of boring heiresses out there what a waste i say these are people who are so afraid of what other people might think or write about them they dont take advantage of all the possibilities that being an heiress hands you on a silver platter they think theres a prescribed way of being an heiress that youre supposed to conform to it involves wearing white gloves big hats and pearls having some dowdy debut or a comingout party and going to fancy snobby allgirl colleges boring oldfashioned stuff like that i totally disagree there is no sin worse in life than being boring and nothing worse than letting other people tell you what to do i was one of the few heiresses to walk the runway as a model a lot of people thought that was shocking why did i do it was it a desperate cry for attention like the papers said hardly its not like i need any more attention did i do it for money of course not modeling doesnt pay that well anyway unless youre gisele or cindy crawford or like patti hansen you get to marry a rock star i did it because it was fun well suddenly everyone got all freaked out it seems modeling wasnt on the list of socially acceptable activities for heiresses then a year later every other socialite started walking the runway now you cant keep them off the runway now there are model agents in new york and la who specialize in getting socialites jobs as models and if i hadnt pursued it it might never have happened i mean if i didnt do it who would have by being brave and channeling my inner heiress i created a new opportunity for young heiresses that is what being an heiress means to me being in charge after all if you have money and certain advantages no one should be in charge of your life but you especially after the age of twentyone im twentythree now but in a lot of ways i always took matters into my own hands i knew i wanted to be a model actress and singer from a pretty young age so i told my parents and they could tell i was serious in so many ways being an heiress is really all in your head if you follow your own plans and dreams and you dont let anyone talk you out of them then youll start to get the hang of being an heiress its all about feeling entitled which seems for some weird reason to make a very big impression a good one and whos more empowered than an heiress heiresses are born with privileges if you walk into a room and know youre the most exciting person in the room becauseyou are then youre feeling like an heiress all you need after that is a good handbag a great pose and very high heels and youre on your way long blond hair doesnt hurt either the best way for me to tell everyone how to act and feel like an heiress is by doing this book first of all the book parties will be really fun but beyond that i want to put it out there that if you can channel your own inner heiress create your own image and project an extreme sense of confidence even if you dont really feel it every moment people will treat you differently sure heiresses are born with privileges but if an heiress doesnt project naturalborn superconfidence no one is going to take her seriously or put her on the pedestal she deserves to be on put yourself on your own pedestal and then everybody else will too always act like youre on camera and the spotlights on you always behave like you are the center of attention always act like youre wearing an invisible crown i do and its always worked for me and try adding a little attitude to your normal behavior for instance if you expect people to do things for you they will if you act like a doormat no one will lift a finger for you that does not mean you should ever be mean or snobby a true heiress is never mean to anyone except a girl who steals her boyfriend an heiress should be a little above it all but sweet she can afford to be kind because shes well bred and never in a hurry and she shouldnt go around spilling her guts to everyone have some secrets i say secrets are very important assets if youre going to be an heiress even if you have no secrets and everyone does youve got to make people think that you do if people read a few tidbits about you in vanity fair or on page six they instantly want to know more they will want to know everything about you if theres one thing ive learned its this people need to believe your life is better than theirs after all everyone needs a fantasy okay maybe i dont but most rich people want something they cant have if they have one rollsroyce they fantasize about having two if they have a closet full of chanel they want a closet full of gucci im a fantasy to a lot of people they want to think that i have more fun than they do have fewer problems wake up looking great go to sleep looking great can buy and eat anything in the world i want and get any hot guy i want they think im paris barbie i take that as a compliment barbie is my total fashion icon no one wants to think that i have a normal life or problems they prefer to imagine someone has the perfect life and i guess mine seems like that to a lot of people ive only been me so i cant tell if my life is perfect or not the way i keep people wondering about me is to smile all the time and say as little as possible smile beautifully smile big smile confidently and everyone thinks youve got all kinds of secret things going on and that keeps them wanting more and when they want more you are automatically interesting if you give too much away no one needs to know anything else youve given it all away and for free and if you do that well youre never going to have any money or make any money its what they call supply and demand so while im going to reveal some of my secrets here dont get your hopes up too high ill never reveal all of them how tacky would that be an heiress never reveals how much money shes worth or her familys worth an heiress hardly ever refers to money period an heiress never reveals how many guys shes dated orwhatever there are definitely a number of things an heiress wont talk about you can imagine what they are theres a big difference between being fun and provocative and being totally overthetop and gross an heiress knows how to tread that fine line in stilettos ive noticed that my girlfriends want to tell their friends everything they need to talk about every tight tshirt they buy every carbohydrate they eat every insecurity they have every single thing a guy says to them these girls have no secrets so no one needs to talk behind their backs theyve spilled it all i dont do that rule number one heiresses arent needy if an heiress is feeling a little insecure she should go shopping and if she still doesnt feel any better she should go to paris or sainttropez for the weekend if necessary because theres always another fun place to visit another set of fun people another cute outfit waiting to be snapped up theres no reason for an heiress to ever ever be bored rule number two an heiress should never be too serious being too serious is very dull and is a sign you have no imagination or personality no one really wants to hang out with anyone too serious an heiress is so confident and why shouldnt she be that she should always be able to make fun of herself first of all if you make fun of yourself no one gets upset when you make fun of other people and if you make fun of yourself first no one gets the urge to do it behind your back youve taken all the power away from them and made them laugh its a double whammy here are my failsafe instructions on how to be an heiress and live like you have a privileged life and i am serious about them most of them anyway my instructions on how to be an heiress 1 be born into the right family choose your chromosomes wisely this may seem like ludicrous advice but actually it isnt if an heiress is in control of everything why shouldnt she be in control of who shes born to you know how everyone always says there are no accidents well i believe you choose who youre born to and if you do have the misfortune of being born into the wrong family remember no one has to know airing family laundry is definitely a big nono for an heiress you can always reinvent yourself and your lineage if you have to half of park avenue and bel air have lineage can be a state of mind 2 have a great name if you are going to be an heiress you cant have a normal name unless youre british all british people have plain names and that works pretty well over there but in america youve got to have a name that stands out i love my name paris is my favorite city and paris without the p is heiress isnt it in sixth grade people would make fun of me and call me france or london well im going to name my own daughter paris an heiress needs to have a glamorous or a really cute name my sister nickys name is cute an heiresss dog also needs to have a cute name my teacup chihuahua is named tinkerbell so she acts like a tinkerbell if you have a cute name you will act cute if you have a glam name you will act glam its that simple future moms should make a note of that 3 have absolutely flawless skin but dont fret over it pile makeup on and never ever have a breakout perfect skin is a birthright and it means you can never really take a bad photograph no amount of junk food or cocacola can change your skin and if god forbid it does have a great makeup artist standing by it cant hurt 4 eat only fast food or the most fabulous food greasy chips or perfect crab cakes cotton candy or caviar fast food or fois gras french fries or blackpepper shrimp from the ivy in la cheesy junk or expensive cheese being an heiress is all about extremes 5 develop a way of entering a room that looks royal and regal but not snobby learn how to pose in an onslaught of flashing lights without blinking note to celebrities you can always improve always know your best angle for your body and your face and work it study your own pictures and youll figure it out 6 never ever wake up before ten never go to bed before three normal hours are for normal people you never want to be normal anyone can be normal how boring im yawning 7 always tell everyone what they want to hear then do what you want that way no one ever gets mad at you they get very confused then blame it on themselves if anyone confronts you smile sweetly and act coyly particularly with guys and bosses try not to have bosses if you can avoid them or have your manager deal with them 8 never have only one cell phone when you can have many lose one all the time that way if you havent called someone back you can blame it on the lost phone its very important to get a new model the minute it comes out nokias ericksons motorolas those are the coolest always have at least two numbers a friend line and a business line if i feel like avoiding a call i answer my phone in a phony british accent and say hello paris hiltons line or something like that i do that if im expecting a call from a guy ive changed my mind about and i dont want to have dinner with him anymore every woman has the right to change her mind from time to time therefore heiresses have more of a right 9 never wear the same thing twice this is particularly important if youre going to be photographed a lot which i am if you double up people will think you have only one outfit and thats annoying and untrue 10 dont wear a dress thats in all the magazines thats for girls with no imagination who just buy what magazines tell them to buy look for the cool unusual dress that no one else has the nerve to wear dare to be different dare to wear colors and prints all the boring new york socialite girls wear black do you ever see a girl in a magazine wearing black i dont think so dont run out and buy the bag of the moment or the dress of the moment i like expensive things but i like cheap things too i like anything thats cute and makes me happy i havent met too many clothes i didnt like except black clothes 11 if youre happy wear pink if youre depressed wear black black is for people who dont want to have fun with clothes and who are always hiding in other words depressed no one with a truly great body wears black trust me and if you really want to stand out and be confident wear white 12 make plans plans and more plans invite everyone you know to come along if there arent enough hours in the day dont worry there will be you live in a different time zone heiress time 13 act ditzy lose things it throws people off and makes them think youre adorable and less together than you really are 14 if all else fails act bored not boring theres a huge difference 15 public displays of affection are okay in limited amounts but only with your serious boyfriend because thats exactly what someone with a famous family name is not supposed to do it makes other boys think youre dangerous so they will all want you too guys like women theyre a little afraid of no make that a lot afraid of 16 always have a very big bodyguard it intimidates guys if a guy does have the nerve to approach you when your bodyguard is around you know hes got to be pretty fearless 17 always have a tan it looks like youve been in an exotic ie expensive place it can never look fake even if it is get the sprayon tan so it doesnt get all over your clothes 18 change your hairstyle all the time everyone expects you to have the same hairstyle in every photo and only dull people do that tell everyone youre wearing hair extensions even if you arent because they dont expect you to tell them 19 never drink diet soda it shows you have no nerve only drink real colas caffeinepacked energy drinks or vitamin water hate champagne because thats what everyone expects you to love energy drinks are the best party drinks you never get tired you never have a hangover and you can make fun of all the loaded people who think theyre clever but are really acting stupid 20 fear nothing except insects and sweaty guys who insist on kissing you when they come up to say hello theres nothing worse than a sweaty guy who kisses you on both cheeks once is bad enough but to have to go through it twice is really two times too much 21 never be predictable always surprise people that way they will never get tired of you 22 if the media plays with you well play with them i went on saturday night live soon after my name was in the headlines every day for something i wasnt too proud of and which had really upset my family on weekend update with jimmy fallon the script had him asking me is it hard to get a room in the paris hilton is it roomy and he wanted to cut it but i wouldnt let him no way that was the funniest line and i got the upper hand with the media the moment he said it on national tv thats when it all clicked and things started to change people knew i could laugh at myself and that one bad incident was not going to make me lock myself in my room 23 last but not least make fun of yourself never take yourself or rules too seriously see all above rules
