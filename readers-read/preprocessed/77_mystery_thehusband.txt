 excerpt 1 a man begins dying at the moment of his birth most people live in denial of death8217s patient courtship until late in life and deep in sickness they become aware of him sitting bedside eventually mitchell rafferty would be able to cite the minute that he began to recognize the inevitability of his death monday may 14 1143 in the morning8211three weeks short of his twentyeighth birthday until then he had rarely thought of dying a born optimist charmed by nature8217s beauty and amused by humanity he had no cause or inclination to wonder when and how his mortality would be proven when the call came he was on his knees thirty flats of red and purple impatiens remained to be planted the flowers produced no fragrance but the fertile smell of the soil pleased him his clients these particular homeowners liked saturated colors red purple deep yellow hot pink they would not accept white blooms or pastels mitch understood them raised poor they had built a successful business by working hard and taking risks to them life was intense and saturated colors reflected the truth of nature8217s vehemence this apparently ordinary but in fact momentous morning the california sun was a buttery ball the sky had a basted sheen pleasantly warm not searing the day nevertheless left a greasy sweat on ignatius barnes his brow glistened his chin dripped at work in the same bed of flowers ten feet from mitch iggy looked boiled from may until july his skin responded to the sun not with melanin but with a fierce blush for onesixth of the year before he finally tanned he appeared to be perpetually embarrassed iggy did not possess an understanding of symmetry and harmony in landscape design and he couldn8217t be trusted to trim roses properly he was a hard worker however and good if not intellectually bracing company 8220you hear what happened to ralph gandhi8221 iggy asked 8220who8217s ralph gandhi8221 8220mickey8217s brother8221 8220mickey gandhi i don8217t

mitch troweled a cavity in the loose soil 8220they didn8217t have finger bells either8221 wiping his brow with one forearm iggy complained 8220i must have eskimo genes i break a sweat at fifty

ago8221 8220so what happened to ralph8221 8220ralph who8221 8220mickey gandhi8217s brother8221 8220oh yeah an iguana bit off his nose8221 8220nasty8221 8220some fully macking tenfooters were breaking so ralph and some guys went nightriding at the wedge8221 the wedge was a famous surfing spot at the end of the balboa peninsula in newport beach iggy said 8220they packed coolers full of submarine sandwiches and beer and one of them brought ming8221 8220ming8221 8220that8217s the iguana8221 8220so it was a pet8221 8220ming he8217d always been sweet before8221 8220i8217d expect iguanas to be moody8221 8220no they8217re affectionate what happened was some wanker not even a surfer just a wannabe tagalong slipped ming a quarterdose of meth in a piece of salami8221 8220reptiles on speed8221 mitch said 8220is a bad idea8221 8220meth ming was a whole different animal from cleanandsober ming8221 iggy confirmed putting down his trowel sitting back on the heels of his work shoes mitch said 8220so now ralph gandhi is noseless8221 8220ming didn8217t eat the nose he just bit it off and spit it out8221 8220maybe he didn8217t like indian food8221 8220they had a big cooler full of ice water and beer they put the nose in the cooler and rushed it to the hospital8221 8220did they take ralph too8221 8220they had to take ralph it was his nose8221 8220well8221 mitch said 8220we are talking about boardheads8221 8220they said it was kinda blue when they fished it out of the ice water but a plastic surgeon sewed it back on and now it8217s not blue anymore8221 8220what happened to ming8221 8220he crashed he was totally ampedout for a day now he8217s his old self8221 8220that8217s good it8217s probably hard to find a clinic that8217ll do iguana rehab8221 mitch got to his feet and retrieved three dozen empty plastic plant pots he carried them to his extendedbed pickup the truck stood at the curb in the shade of an indian laurel although the neighborhood had been builtout only five years earlier the big tree had already lifted the sidewalk eventually the insistent roots would block lawn drains and invade the sewer system the developer8217s decision to save one hundred dollars by not installing a root barrier would produce tens of thousands in repair work for plumbers landscapers and concrete contractors when mitch planted an indian laurel he always used a root barrier he didn8217t need to make future work for himself green growing nature would keep him busy the street lay silent without traffic not the barest breath of a breeze stirred the trees from a block away on the farther side of the street a man and a dog approached the dog a retriever spent less time walking than it did sniffing messages left by others of its kind the stillness pooled so deep that mitch almost believed he could hear the panting of the distant canine golden the sun and the dog the air and the promise of the day the beautiful houses behind deep lawns mitch rafferty could not afford a home in this neighborhood he was satisfied just to be able to work here you could love great art but have no desire to live in a museum he noticed a damaged sprinkler head where lawn met sidewalk he got his tools from the truck and knelt on the grass taking a break from the impatiens his cell phone rang he unclipped it from his belt flipped it open the time was displayed821111438211but no caller8217s number showed on the screen he took the call anyway 8220big green8221 he said which was the name he8217d given his twoman business nine years ago though he no longer remembered why 8220mitch i love you8221 holly said 8220hey sweetie8221 8220whatever happens i love you8221 she cried out in pain a clatter and crash suggested a struggle alarmed mitch rose to his feet 8220holly8221 some guy said something some guy who now had the phone mitch didn8217t hear the words because he was focused on the background noise holly squealed he8217d never heard such a sound from her such fear 8220sonofabitch8221 she said and was silenced by a sharp crack as though she8217d been slapped the stranger on the phone said 8220you hear me rafferty8221 8220holly where8217s holly8221 now the guy was talking away from the phone not to mitch 8220don8217t be stupid stay on the floor8221 another man spoke in the background his words unclear the one with the phone said 8220she gets up punch her you want to lose some teeth honey8221 she was with two men one of them had hit her hit her mitch couldn8217t get his mind around the situation reality suddenly seemed as slippery as the narrative of a nightmare a methcrazed iguana was more real than this near the house iggy planted impatiens sweating red from the sun as solid as ever 8220that8217s better honey that8217s a good girl8221 mitch couldn8217t draw breath a great weight pressed on his lungs he tried to speak but couldn8217t find his voice didn8217t know what to say here in bright sun he felt casketed buried alive 8220we have your wife8221 said the guy on the phone mitch heard himself ask 8220why8221 8220why do you think asshole8221 mitch didn8217t know why he didn8217t want to know he didn8217t want to reason through to an answer because every possible answer would be a horror 8220i8217m planting flowers8221 8220what8217s wrong with you rafferty8221 8220that8217s what i do plant flowers repair sprinklers8221 8220are you buzzed or something8221 8220i8217m just a gardener8221 8220so we have your wife you get her back for two million cash8221 mitch knew it wasn8217t a joke if it were a joke holly would have to be in on it but her sense of humor was not cruel 8220you8217ve made a mistake8221 8220you hear what i said two million8221 8220man you aren8217t listening i8217m a gardener8221 8220we know8221 8220i have like eleven thousand bucks in the bank8221 8220we know8221 brimming with fear and confusion mitch had no room for anger compelled to clarify perhaps more for himself than for the caller he said 8220i just run a little twoman operation8221 8220you8217ve got until midnight wednesday sixty hours we8217ll be in touch about the details8221 mitch was sweating 8220this is nuts where would i get two million bucks8221 8220you8217ll find a way8221 the stranger8217s voice was hard implacable in a movie death might sound like this 8220it isn8217t possible8221 mitch said 8220you want to hear her scream again8221 8220no don8217t8221 8220do you love her8221 8220yes8221 8220really love her8221 8220she8217s everything to me8221 how peculiar that he should be sweating yet feel so cold 8220if she8217s everything to you8221 said the stranger 8220then you8217ll find a way8221 8220there isn8217t a way8221 8220if you go to the cops we8217ll cut her fingers off one by one and cauterize them as we go we8217ll cut her tongue out and her eyes then we8217ll leave her alone to die as fast or slow as she wants8221 the stranger spoke without menace in a matteroffact tone as if he were not making a threat but were instead merely explaining the details of his business model mitchell rafferty had no experience of such men he might as well have been talking to a visitor from the far end of the galaxy he could not speak because suddenly it seemed that he might so easily unwittingly say the wrong thing and ensure holly8217s death sooner rather than later the kidnapper said 8220just so you8217ll know we8217re serious 8221 after a silence mitch asked 8220what8221 8220see that guy across the street8221 mitch turned and saw a single pedestrian the man walking the slow dog they had progressed half a block the sunny day had a porcelain glaze rifle fire shattered the stillness and the dogwalker went down shot in the head 8220midnight wednesday8221 said the man on the phone 8220we8217re damn serious8221
