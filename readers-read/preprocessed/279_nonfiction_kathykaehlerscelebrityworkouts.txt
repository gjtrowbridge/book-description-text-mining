 chapter 1 my hollywood fitness secrets revealed psssst want me to let you in on a little hollywood secret the beautiful sexy bodies that you see on television and the silver screen arent simply the product of good genes not all of your favorite celebrities were born with impeccable figures or have been slim and sculpted their entire lives in fact most of them have to work hard to stay so trim toned and youthful lookingjust like you and me though we tend to put them on pedestals celebrities arent superhuman some particularly supermodels like cindy crawford and claudia schiffer may have genetic advantages but they still have to exercise and watch what they eat and it isnt always easy like you and me they have lazy days they sometimes feel uncoordinated when trying a new workout they get bored when they do the same exercises over and over they have cravings for pizza ice cream and other fattening foods they often want to do nothing more than collapse on the couch after a long exhausting day on the set my celebrity clients may not have traditional ninetofive jobs but they certainly dont have all day to spend at the gym truth be told none of the actresses or models that i train typically exercises for more than an hour at a time these women are unbelievably busy whether theyre working on a movie a tv sitcom a fashion show or a photo shoot their schedules tend to be very demanding im talking ten to twelvehour days on top of their chaotic careers they have families bills grocery shopping errands and countless other responsibilities just like everyone else and most of them dont have a team of personal assistants to help them either take julia roberts for example she doesnt even hire someone to clean her house she washes her own dishes scrubs her own bathroom and mops her own kitchen floor celebrities are constantly subjected to the scrutiny of the camera whether theyre on a film set walking the red carpet or running from the paparazzi if you can imagine having your body magnified on screen or photos of yourself plastered all over the tabloids then you may understand the kind of motivation that they have to look good sadly for some the pressure can be overwhelming in recent years a number of them such as paula abdul and carr otis have started coming forward and sharing their struggles to remain so unnaturally thin to keep the pounds off some have resorted to unhealthy even potentially lifethreatening tactics such as excessive exercise vomiting drug and alcohol abuse cigarette smoking and harsh diuretics others have gone under the plastic surgeons knife for procedures like liposuction and tummy tucks fortunately hollywood has finally woken up to the realization that superthin is superunattractive and superunhealthy a decade or so ago in the entertainment industry skinny minnie wasnt skinny enough size zero was the norm in los angeles but in just the last few years the ideal body shape has started to change the waif look is out fit and toned is in whats sexy is looking strong lean and healthy many of our favorite starsincluding catherine zetajones and jennifer lopezare now embracing their curves and we all know thats what men really love i know all about the dangers of trying to be skinny although id never worried about my weight as a kid i became unhappy with my appearance in high school i wasnt overweight i had a sturdy athletic frame but i didnt think i was thin enough during my senior year i started taking overthecounter diet pills to lose weight this insane habit continued into my college years when i also battled bulimia on a typical morning i would swallow a diet pill then go without food until i was absolutely starving after bingeing to satisfy my hunger id run to the ladies room to vomit at one point i was taking up to five diet pills a day one afternoon during my sophomore year it all started to unravel as i was walking out of my dorm room i suffered a grandmal seizure i woke up on the sidewalk with a paramedic kneeling beside me later in the hospital i lied to my doctors telling them the seizure must have been caused by stress and lack of sleep they believed me and i was released from the hospital but even this scary experience wasnt enough to make me quit i continued in the vicious bingepurgepill cycle for another year until i finally had another seizure realizing that i would die if i didnt change my behavior i vowed to stop taking diet pills and stop throwing up with every bit of selfdiscipline i had i took control of my life i educated myself about healthy eating and started giving my body the nutrients that it so badly needed i have never taken diet pills or vomited since my allaround good habits lasted about six years up until the time that i moved to los angeles at that point my career was going full throttle and i had a full schedule training clients and teaching aerobics classes but i was overexercising and not eating enough at the same time i was dating a famous actor who liked to stay up all night and sleep all day i was partying too much and only getting a few hours of shuteye each night during the day i was drinking tons of coffee just to keep myself going throughout all of this my body was suffering i felt tired and worn out i realized that i wasnt living healthfully and as someone whose career was based on promoting health and fitness i felt like a total hypocrite then in 1990 it caught up with me i suffered a third seizure while hiking with a client at the hospital my doctor threatened to put me on antiseizure medication which meant my drivers license would be taken away since my livelihood depended on driving to see my clients i promised him that i would change my habits the moment that i walked out the door and i did after that day i completely overhauled my lifestyle i started eating right and sleeping eight hours a night i also pledged to give up caffeine for good thankfully ive been in excellent health ever since over the years

it i promise that youll love what it does for your body and as you get stronger you may even find yourself craving every opportunity to get up and move the triangle of fitness physical fitness has three integral parts cardiovascular fitness strength and flexibility all three components are vital for a healthy balanced bodyand should be the basis of any solid fitness plan cardiovascular exercise works one of your most important muscles your heartalong with your lungs if you do cardio workouts regularly your heart wont have to work as hard to pump blood through your body and your lungs will deliver oxygen with less effort this translates into more endurance and staying power whether youre running after your kids or competing in a bike race because cardio burns a lot of calories its also an important tool for losing weight the second component strength training helps work important muscles in other areas of your bodyyour legs buttocks hips arms shoulders chest back and abs as we get older our muscles and bones get weaker especially if we dont eat right or exercise enough strength exercises can help prevent or even reverse these losses reducing your risk of osteoporosis furthermore if your muscles are strong youre less likely to suffer back pain and other debilitating injuries you also have the strength many women think that cardiovascular exercise such as jogging or walking on a treadmill is the best and only way to trim down thats just plain wrong in fact strength training is the secret weapon of many of hollywoods hottest female stars it allows you to develop specific muscles for that sexy sculpted look we all admire when you build muscle you not only look more defined your metabolism gets a boost so you burn more calories all day long muscle weighs more than fat but it takes up less spaceso even if the numbers on the scale dont change your clothes will get looser and your body will begin to look firmer and more taut the last piece of the triangle is flexibility our muscles are like rubber bandsthey are incredibly resilient but the less you use them the tighter they get flexibility is crucial for preventing injuries and staying mobile by stretching regularly you can keep your muscles limber increase your range of motion improve your balance and enhance your posture whats more research suggests that stretching immediately after your strengthtraining workouts can help you build more muscle for an even bigger metabolic boost how much is enough and now for the milliondollar question how much exercise do you have to do to get all of the benefits and achieve your best body for weight control and optimum health experts recommend at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week thirty minutes a day can help you achieve important health benefits and is a good starting goal if youre currently sedentary as you get in better shape youll want to aim for closer to an hour andor work on increasing the intensity of your workouts for even more benefits and calories burned this may sound overwhelming to those of you who havent been exercising regularly but dont get discouraged with my program youll start slowly and gradually work on building strength you can also do the workouts at your own pace if time is an issue for you and youre worried that you wont fit it all in remember that the benefits of exercise are cumulative in other words you dont have to do your 30 to 60 minutes all at once instead you can do some in the morning some at lunch and some in the late afternoon youll find more details on this type of scheduling in chapter 2 when it comes to fitness some activity is always better than none but too much exercise isnt a good thing either i found this out the hard way at the start of my career in hollywood i was working out way too mucheven for a personal trainer on a typical weekday id train five or six clients in a row in the morning then teach two backtoback step aerobics classes at night even though i thought i was in great shape i soon discovered that overexercising can lead to injury and burnout i was fatigued and frequently in pain from one overuse injury or another your exercise sessions should invigorate you not wipe you out so its important to find a happy medium these days i take a much more moderate approach and to tell you the truth i feel much healthier and my body looks about the same fortunately this message has also caught on in hollywood and i no longer see as much of the exercise mania that gripped the industry a few years ago
