 1 quotyour cheeks are looking alarmingly flushed christinequot her mother remarked setting her embroidery down in her lap the better to observe her daughter quotand your eyes are very bright i hope you are not coming down with a feverquot christine laughed quoti have been at the vicarage playing with the childrenquot she explained quotalexander wanted to play cricket but after a few minutes it became clear that marianne could not catch a ball and robin could not hit one we played hideandseek instead though alexander thought it was somewhat beneath his dignity now that he is nine years old until i asked him how his poor aunt must feel then at the age of twentynine i was it all the time of course we had great fun until charles poked his head out of the study window and asked usrhetorically i supposehow he was ever to get his sermon finished with all the noise we were making so hazel gave us all a glass of lemonade and shooed the children off to the parlor to read quietly poor things and i came homequot quoti supposequot her eldest sister eleanor said looking up from her book and observing christine over the tops of her spectacles quotyou did not wear your bonnet while you frolicked with our niece and nephews that is not just a flush it is a sunburnquot quothow can one poke ones head into small hiding places if it is swollen to twice its size with a bonnetquot christine asked reasonably she began to arrange the flowers she had cut from the garden on her way inside in a vase of water she had brought with her from the kitchen quotand your hair looks like a birds nestquot eleanor added quotthat is soon correctedquot christine rumpled her short curls with both hands and laughed quotthere is that betterquot eleanor shook her head before returning her attention to her bookbut not before smiling there was a comfortable hush in the room again while they all concentrated upon their chosen activities but the silencetempered by the chirping of birds and the whirring of insects from beyond the open windowwas broken after a few minutes by the sound of horses hooves clopping along the village street in the direction of hyacinth cottage and the rumble of wheels there was more than one horse and the wheels were heavy ones it must be the carriage from schofield park baron renables country seat which was a mere two miles away christine thought absently none of them took any particular notice of the carriages approach lady renable often used it when she went visiting even though a gig would have served her purpose just as well or a horseor her feet eleanor often described lady renable as frivolous and ostentatious and it was not an inaccurate description she was also christines friend and then it became obvious that the horses were slowing the carriage wheels squeaked in protest all three ladies looked up quoti do believequot eleanor said peering out the window over her spectacles again quotlady renable must be coming here to what do we owe the honor i wonder were you expecting her christinequot quoti knew i should have changed my cap after luncheonquot their mother said quotsend mrs skinner running upstairs for a clean one if you will christinequot quotthe one you are wearing is quite becoming enough mamaquot christine assured her finishing the flower arrangement quickly and crossing the room to kiss her mothers forehead quotit is only melaniequot quotof course it is only lady renable that is the whole pointquot her mother said exasperated but she did not renew her plea for a different cap to be sent for it did not take a genius to guess why melanie was coming here either quoti daresay she is coming to ask why you refused her invitationquot eleanor said echoing her thought quotand i daresay she will not take no for an answer now that she has come in person poor christine do you want to run up to your room and have me tell her that you seem to have come down with a touch of smallpoxquot christine laughed while their mother threw up her hands in horror indeed melanie was not famed for taking no for an answer whatever christine was doing and she was almost always busy with somethingteaching at the village school several times a week visiting and helping the elderly and infirm or a new mother or a sick child or a friend calling at the vicarage to amuse and play with the children since in her estimation charles and her sister hazel neglected them altogether too much with the excuse that children did not need adults to play with them when they had one anotherno matter what christine was doing melanie always chose to believe that she must be simply languishing in the hope that someone would appear with a frivolous diversion of course melanie was a friend and christine really did enjoy spending time with herand with her children but there were limits she surely was coming here to renew in person the invitation that a servant had brought in writing yesterday christine had written back with a tactfully worded but firm refusal indeed she had refused just as firmly a whole month ago when first asked the carriage drew to a halt before the garden gate with a great deal of noise and fuss doubtless drawing the attention of every villager to the fact that the baroness was condescending to call upon mrs thompson and her daughters at hyacinth cottage there were the sounds of opening doors and slamming doors and then someoneprobably the coachman since it certainly would not be melanie herselfknocked imperiously on the house door christine sighed and seated herself at the table her mother put away her embroidery and adjusted her cap and eleanor with a smirk looked down at her book a few moments later melanie lady renable swept into the room past mrs skinner the housekeeper who had opened the door to announce her she was as usual dressed absurdly for the country she looked as elaborately turned out as if she were planning a promenade in hyde park in london bright plumes waved high above the large stiff poke of her bonnet giving the illusion of height a lorgnette was clutched in one of her gloved hands she seemed to half fill the room christine smiled at her with amused affection quotah there you are christinequot she said grandly after inclining her head graciously to the other ladies and asking how they did quothere i amquot christine agreed quothow do you do melanie do take the chair across from mamasquot but her ladyship waved away the invitation with her lorgnette quoti have not a moment to sparequot she said quoti do not doubt i will bring on one of my migraines before the day is over i regret that you have made this visit necessary christine my written invitation ought to have sufficed you know i cannot imagine why you wrote back with a refusal bertie believes you are being coy and declares that it would serve you right if i did not come in person to persuade you he often says ridiculous things i know why you refused and i have come here to tell you that you are sometimes ridiculous too it is because basil and hermione are coming is it not and for some reason you quarreled with them after oscar died but that was a long time ago and you have as much right to come as they do oscar was after all basils brother and though he is gone poor man you are still and always will be connected by marriage to our family christine you must not be stubborn or modest you must remember that you are the widow of a viscounts brotherquot christine was not likely to forget though sometimes she wished she could she had been married for seven years to oscar derrick brother of basil viscount elrick and cousin of lady renable they had met at schofield park at the very first house party melanie hosted there after her marriage to bertie baron renable it had been a brilliant match for christine the daughter of a gentleman of such slender means that he had been obliged to augment his income by becoming the village schoolmaster now melanie wanted her friend to attend another of her house parties quotit is truly kind of you to ask mequot christine said quotbut i would really rather not come you knowquot quotnonsensequot melanie raised the lorgnette to her eyes and looked about the room with it an affectation that always amused both christine and eleanor who dipped her head behind her book now to hide her smile quotof course you want to come whoever would not mama will be there with audrey and sir lewis wisemanthe party is in honor of their betrothal though it has of course already been announced even hector has been talked into coming though you know he can never be persuaded to enjoy himself unless one of us forces him into itquot quotand justin tooquot christine asked audrey was melanies young sister hector and justin her brothers justin had been christines friend since their first acquaintance at that longago house partyalmost her only friend it had seemed during the last few years of her marriage quotof course justin is coming tooquot melanie said quotdoes he not go everywhereand does he not spend more time with me than with anyone else you have always got along famously with my family but even apart from them we are expecting a large crowd of distinguished agreeable guests and we have any number of pleasurable activities planned for everyones amusement morning noon and night you must come i absolutely insist upon itquot quotoh melaniequot christine began quoti would reallyquot quotyou ought to go christinequot her mother urged her quotand enjoy yourself you are always so busy on other peoples behalfquot quotyou might as well say yes nowquot eleanor added peering over her spectacles again rather than removing them until their visitor had left and she could return her undivided attention to her book quotyou know lady renable will not leave here until she has talked you into itquot christine looked at her exasperated but her sisters eyes merely twinkled back into her own why did no one ever invite eleanor to entertainments like this but christine knew the answer at the age of thirtyfour her eldest sister had settled into middle age and a placid spinsterhood as their mothers prop and stay without any regretful glance back at her youth it was a course she had chosen quite deliberately after the only beau she had ever had was killed in the peninsular wars years ago and no man had changed her mind since then though a few had tried quotyou are quite right miss thompsonquot melanie said her bonnet plumes nodding approvingly in eleanors direction quotthe most provoking thing has happened hector has been his usual impulsive selfquot hector magnus viscount mowbury was a bookish semirecluse christine could not imagine him doing anything impulsive melanie drummed her gloved fingers on the tabletop quothe has absolutely no idea how to go on the poor dearquot she said quothe has had the audacity to invite a friend of his to come here with him assuring the man that the invitation came from me and he very obligingly informed me of this turn of events only two days agofar too late for me to invite another willing lady to make numbers even againquot ah all was suddenly clear christines written invitation had come yesterday morning the day after social disaster had loomed on the horizon of melanies world quotyou must comequot melanie said again quotdear christine you absolutely must it would be an unthinkable disgrace to be forced to host a house party at which the numbers are not even you could not possibly wish such a thing upon meespecially when it is in your power to save mequot quotit would be a dreadful shamequot christines mother agreed quotwhen christine is here with nothing particular to do for the next two weeksquot quotmamaquot christine protested eleanors eyes were still twinkling at her over the tops of her spectacles she sighedaloud she had been quite determined to resist she had married into the ton nine years ago at the time she had been thrilled beyond words even apart from the fact that she had been head over ears in love with oscar she had been elated at the prospect of moving upward into more exalted social circles and all had been well for a few yearswith both her marriage and the ton and then everything had started to go wrongeverything she still felt bewildered and hurt when she remembered and when she remembered the end well she had blocked it quite effectively as the only way to save her sanity and regain her spirits and she needed no reminder now she really did not want to see hermione and basil ever again but she had a weakness where people in trouble were concerned and melanie really did seem to be in a bit of a bind she set such great store by her reputation as a hostess who did everything with meticulous correctness and when all was said and done they were friends quotperhapsquot she suggested hopefully quoti can remain here and come over to schofield a few times to join the partyquot quotbut bertie would have to call out the carriage to take you home every night and send it to bring you every morningquot melanie said quotit would be just too inconvenient christinequot quoti could walk overquot christine suggested melanie set one hand to her bosom as if to still her palpitating heart quotand arrive each day with a dusty or muddy hem and rosy cheeks and windblown hairquot she said quotthat would be quite as bad as not having you at all you must come to stay that is all there is to it all our guests will be arriving the day after tomorrow i will have the carriage sent during the morning so that you may settle in earlyquot christine realized that the moment for a firm refusal had passed she was doomed to attend one of melanies house parties it seemed but gracious heaven she had nothing to wear and no money with which to rush out to buy a new wardrobenot that there was anywhere to rush to within fifty miles anyway melanie had recently returned from a season in london where she had gone to help sponsor her sisters comeout and presentation to the queen all her guestsexcept christinewere probably coming from there too bringing their london finery and their london manners with them this was the stuff of nightmares
