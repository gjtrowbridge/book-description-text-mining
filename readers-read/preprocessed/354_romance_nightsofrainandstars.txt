one andreas thought he saw the fire down in the bay before anyone else did he peered and shook his head in disbelief this sort of thing didnt happen not here in aghia anna not to the olga the little red and white boat that took visitors out to the bay not to manos foolish headstrong manos whom he had known since he was a boy this was some kind of dream some trick of the light that could not be smoke and flames coming from the olga perhaps he was not feeling well some of the older people in the village said that they imagined things if the day was hot if there had been too much raki the night before but he had gone to bed early there had been no raki or dancing or singing in his hillside restaurant andreas put his hand up to shade his eyes and at the same time a cloud passed overhead it wasnt as clear as it had been before he must indeed have been mistaken but now he must pull himself together he had a restaurant to run if people came all the way up the hilly path they would not want to find a madman someone crazed by the sun fancying disasters in a peaceful greek village he continued fixing the red and green plasticcovered cloths with little clips to the long wooden tables on the terrace outside his taverna this would be a hot day with plenty of visitors at lunchtime he had laboriously written the menu on the blackboard he often wondered why he did it it was the same food every day but the visitors liked it and he would put welcome in six languages they liked that too the food was not special nothing they could not have gotten in two dozen other little tavernas there was souvlaki the lamb kebabs well goat kebabs really but the visitors liked to think they were lamb and there was moussaka warm and glutenous in its big pie dish there were the big bowls of salad white squares of salty feta cheese and lush red tomatoes there were the racks of barbouni the red mullet waiting to be grilled the swordfish steaks there were the big steel trays of desserts in the fridge kataifi and baklavanuts honey and pastry the chilled cabinets of retsina and local wines people came from all over the world and loved what andreas and dozens like him could provide he always recognized the nationality of any visitor to aghia anna and could greet them in a few words of their own language it was like a game to him now after years of knowing the way people walked and reading their body language the english didnt like if you offered them a speisenkarte instead of the menu the canadians did not want you to assume they were from the united states italians did not like being greeted with a bonjour and his own fellow countrymen wanted to be thought of as important people from athens rather than tourists from abroad andreas had learned to look carefully before he spoke he was a tall slightly stooped man in his sixties a thick head of gray hair and big bushy eyebrows and as he looked down the path he saw the first customers of the day arriving a quiet man wearing those shorts that only americans wore shorts that did nothing for the bottom or the legs but only pointed out the ridiculous nature of the human figure he was on his own and stopped to look at the fire through binoculars a beautiful german girl tall tanned with hair streaked
