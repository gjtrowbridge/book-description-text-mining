 chapter 1 trouble spring had come to the barony of cant new grass waved beyond the sheepfolds and the flocks fairly ran to the shears eager to be free of their wooly winter coats the streams sang of melting snow and high clouds grazed the pastures of the sky only an eagle troubled the springtime ease of pasture brook and sky it rode the warm air seeking prey and when its wings crossed the sun they cast a menacing shadow on the land lucy wickwright saw the bird but she had other troubles to contend with this morning she pushed her glasses up her nose and looked down from her high perch on a tower of castle cant the grownups arent going to like this she sighed wickwright said pauline would you quit gawking and make yourself useful lucy turned around the adored amp honorable pauline esmeralda simonethierry von cant was bent over the catapult a strand of hair dangling in her face she and lucy had wheeled the weapon around so that it faced the courtyard and now pauline struggled at the winch her tongue sticking out as she slowly cranked down the throwing arm mistress lucy said stepping away from the parapet i dont think151respectfully151that this is such a very good idea lucy was paulines maidservant and had to address her as mistress even though she was a year older and nearly a thumb taller than the barons daughter except for her weekly halfholiday on saturday afternoons lucy spent the better part of every day caring for pauline she dressed her mistress in the morning served her at table and tidied her chambers at night she was also encouraged in the words of the constitution for the benevolent employment of menatarms artisans husbandmen amp domestic servants to satisfy all the whims amp requests of the noble person excepting such as may give rise to treasons gross offenses ampc pauline unfortunately was terribly prone to whims the trigger she said hurry my arms are breaking lucy knelt beside the creaking engine of war and guided the iron catch of the trigger into a ring on the throwing arm pauline let go the winch and the heavy beam caught the trigger with a terrible clank lucy stepped away as the machine popped and groaned in frustration like an old man trying to get up from his chair pauline brushed her hands on her snowy pinafore so she said with a satisfied smile what do you think now lucy glanced nervously toward the parapet maybe we could wait till later she suggested but then no one would see pauline said come help me to load it the ammunition steamed in a wicker basket at their feet the girls had crept into the baronial laundry and collected the wet heap of underclothes while mr fuller and his assistants sipped their morning tea there were long bloomers with frilly gathers balloonish drawers embroidered with the baronial crest sleek slips plain vests and complex corsets with snapping straps they had stopped to rest three times as they hauled the basket up the winding steps of the tower this is a madcap caper wickwright pauline said grasping a handle of the basket im such an imp this will go down in history on three then one lucy bent over the basket please to lift with your knees mistress she advised two lucy gripped the handle two and a half lucy held her breath one never knew how many fractions pauline might count two and three quarters three they upended the soggy contents of the basket into the rope net at the end of the throwing arm as the mass of underwear slowly settled151like an undercooked pudding turned out of its mold151lucy again glanced over the parapet lord cant had emerged from the castle and now lumbered across the rocky courtyard called the bailey his progress attended by guards in crimson frocks and flat bronze helmets behind him came a crowd of ministers and nobles who gossiped and traded tablets of chewing gum their elegant robes sweeping the stones at the rear straggled a whiskered unhappylooking man in a chef s white blouse and hat who held in his fist the two feet of a clacking even unhappierlooking hen the party reached the prisoner a wellknit young man who knelt with bowed head on the flints of the courtyard naked except for a dirty pair of breeches he had been there since sunrise guarded by the blackhooded executioner who stood at attention with his axe lucy found her eyes drawn to this prisoner though she could not say why now the bailiff strode from the crowd of spectators and unrolled a parchment his voice echoed up the castle walls the prisoner ner ner having been found guilty ty ty of the grave and infamous offense fense fense of slandering the noble pastime of chewing gum um um awaits the just and benevolent execution shun shun of the sentence tence tence of death death death papas cap is on crooked pauline said peeking over lucys shoulder i daresay hes just got out of bed lucy imagined she was right adolphus lord cant the exalted amp merciful protector of the barony blinked sleepily in the morning light his unwashed hair curled in wayward tendrils from beneath his baronial cap and he scratched his belly as an underling approached to offer him a paper on a silver platter he lifted it in a trembling hand stay thy hand executioner he said squinting at the script his voice was low and wheezy151lucy could barely hear it from the tower he coughed feebly then went on we are touched by pity our tender heart too tender chanted the ministers and nobles their words slightly garbled by chewing gum lucy heard a bubble pop our tender heart the baron went on and the precepts of the wise teachers move us to pity we command that this sentence be lifted and that the prisoner for the example of the people and the good of his mortal spirit be mercifully sentenced to a term of six months at hard labor hail the compassionate protector chanted the crowd poor chicken lucy sighed yet et et the ransom of blood udd udd must be paid aid aid bellowed the bailiff who brings an offering ing ing what blood shall answer ser ser for this crime ime ime the cook stepped forward and lifted the hen overhead the startled fowl having hung upside down all the while flapped its wings dizzily as it struggled to stay balanced in the cooks upraised fist feathers fell as the bird was carried to the stone of justice where the executioner waited his axe resting on a hairy shoulder hurrah shouted the spectators now pauline squealed pulling lucy away from the parapet she pressed the lanyard of the trigger into her maidservants hand ill count down from three but dont you want to do it lucy asked her nose began to drip as it often did when trouble loomed she sniffed hoping her mistress wouldnt notice im the mastermind of this caper said pauline youre the henchman masterminds give orders henchmen obey yes mistress lucy heard the chicken flapping and cawing151the cook had laid it on the stone of justice pauline hurried back to the parapet and leaned out three she cried two just think wickwright you may save a chickens life one ninesixteenths fivethirteenths onetwelfth pull lucy gave the lanyard a mighty tug but the catapults of castle cant were never meant for heaving soggy underwear over the heads of ministers and nobles and when the great beam swung lucy found that wet knickers slips drawers and corsets made the worst missiles imaginable they tangled in the rope netting of the ammunition basket and the catapult slammed the dripping mass of laundry against the parapet with a great horrible squish had pauline stood a foot to her left she would have been driven like a peg through the slate roof of the tower she escaped with a drenching of gray sudsy water but only a solitary pair of bloomers was hurled into the sky lucy who had fallen on her backside after pulling the trigger scrambled to her feet as the catapults arm swung back its load of drawstring shorts and lisle stockings peeling free and plopping sadly on the slates around her pauline stumbled away from the parapet wiping dirty bubbles from her eyes you soaked me she wailed lucy peeked over the wall the crowd in the bailey gazed up their attention commanded by the sound of crashing laundry the hen had got loose and ran from the pursuing cook the bloomers unfurled and spiraled down like a maple seed veering this way and that before landing with a quiet slurp on the prisoners upturned face oh no lucy whispered seize her her her shouted the bailiff run said pauline yike said lucy she dashed down the parapet walk shouted orders echoed from the courtyard and guardsmen raced to the towers lucy hoped her mistress could delay them for it was a long way to the castle keep where she might run down the corner tower and disappear in the labyrinth of the north wing looking over the parapet she saw that the guards below were outpacing her she ran on her shoes pounding the slates of the parapet walk and when she reached the corner tower she stopped her lungs on fire to her horror she heard the patterflop of guardsmens sandals already well up the spiral stairs she started back through the arch to the parapet walk but by now two guardsmen had arrived at the linenshrouded catapult one of them offered pauline a consoling handkerchief there she is the other cried lucy flew down the stairs toward the climbing sandals of her pursuers they surely thought she had gone mad running down toward them and they gave a shout each time a circuit of the stairs brought her into view for once lucy was grateful for her outlandish rubbersoled shoes they were the only sneakers ever known in the castle where clothing styles of one hundred and fifty years ago151such as paulines pinafore151were considered daringly modern down she ran her feet barely touching the steps until another turn on the winding stairs would have put her in the guards clutches with a determined hyuh she swung down a dim passage and sprinted to another flight of steps steep and narrow and less footworn than those of the tower she scrambled up on aching legs to a landing where an oil lamp burned in a bracket on the wall there she stopped wheezing hard her sandalshod pursuers following noisily up the narrow steps she turned the lamps screw until the flame was drowned in oil then ran blindly on through the darkness when it seemed her legs could carry her no farther she gained a second landing a yellow candle burned there by an oaken door on which a sign warned151 quiet lucy blew out the candle opened the door and entered the familiar cavernous hall of the baronial library dusty light fell from the high windows to the floor where like ancient molting buzzards in their nests threadbare scholars sat at tables piled with books lucy forced herself to walk calmly her hands in her pockets dr azziz the librarian glanced up from her tall wheeled chair as lucy strolled by good morning lucy she whispered what brings you 151 her greeting was cut off by a tumult beyond the door151the clang and clatter of guardsmens helmets striking granite they had arrived at the darkened first landing and had tried to put their feet on a step that was not there strong oaths barked up the stairs my word said the librarian whats happening out there i passed some guardsmen drinking beer maam lucy said outrageous said dr azziz there are scholars working here she beckoned her assistant who was waving a feather duster at a nearby inkstand carlos take me to the door lucy walked away as quickly as decorum allowed she was a scrupulous girl careful never to lie and it was true that she had passed drunken guardsmen151many times in fact she saw no reason to tell the librarian exactly when that had happened for it would be a long story and she considered herself to be in a hurry already the cursing guardsmen were racing up the last flight of stairs at the high canyons of the bookshelves she glanced back to make sure the librarian was not looking then sprinted silently to the other end of the library she slipped through the door just as the guards thudded against the one behind her kneeling she took a barrette from her hair and wedged it under the door kicking it tight with the toe of her sneaker a long windowless corridor stretched before her hung at great intervals with lamps that seemed to shiver in their thin blankets of light lucy groaned dr azziz might delay the guards for a moment but they would surely catch her before she made it halfway down the corridor she ran to the first of the ironhinged doors151of course it was locked151and heard dr azziz crying in protest as the guardsmen stomped noisily across her library lucy ran from door to door testing each stubbornly bolted latch her nose dripped horribly the guardsmen had begun to throw themselves against the jammed door when at last a latch gave way to her hand despite her urgent terror she stopped to read the plaque on the door for lucy was a wellbroughtup girl and would never dream of barging in on an utter stranger she squinted to make out the words in the dim light baronial commission on lexicography orthography amp grammar dr costive gutz subassistant secretary of synonyms antonyms amp pleonasms lucy stepped inside closing the door quickly but quietly behind her the door from the library crashed open and the guards dashed down the corridor she bit her tongue until they had passed the office of synonyms antonyms amp pleonasms then fell back against the door and let out her breath
