 the snatchwood cabin twig sat on the floor between his mother8217s knees and curled his toes in the thick fleece of the tilder rug it was cold and draughty in the cabin twig leaned forwards and opened the door of the stove 8216i want to tell you the story of how you got your name8217 his mother said 8216but i know that story mothermine8217 twig protested spelda sighed twig felt her warm breath on the back of his neck and smelled the pickled tripweed she had eaten for lunch he wrinkled his nose like so much of the food which the woodtrolls relished twig found tripweed disgusting particularly pickled it was slimy and smelled of rotten eggs 8216this time it will be a little different8217 he heard his mother saying 8216this time i will finish the tale8217 twig frowned 8216i thought i8217d already heard the ending8217 spelda tousled her son8217s thick black hair he8217s grown so fast she thought and wiped a tear from the end of her rubbery buttonnose 8216a tale can have many endings8217 she said sadly and watched the purple light from the fire gleaming on twig8217s high cheekbones and sharp chin 8216from the moment you were born8217 she began as she always began 8216you were different 8217 twig nodded it had been painful so painful being different when he was growing up yet it amused him now to think of his parents8217 surprise when he had appeared dark greeneyed smoothskinned and already with unusually long legs for a woodtroll he stared into the fire the lufwood was burning very well purple flames blazed all round the stubby logs as they bumped and tumbled around inside the stove the woodtrolls had many types of wood to choose from and each had its own special properties scentwood for instance burned with a fragrance that sent those who breathed it drifting into a dreamfilled sleep while wood from the silveryturquoise lullabee tree sang as the flames lapped at its bark 8212 strange mournful songs they were and not at all to everyone8217s taste and then there was the bloodoak complete with its parasitic sidekick a barbed creeper known as tarry vine obtaining bloodoak wood was hazardous any woodtroll who did not know his woodlore was liable to end up satisfying the tree8217s love of flesh 8212 for the bloodoak and the tarry vine were two of the greatest dangers in the dark and perilous deepwoods certainly the wood of the bloodoak gave off a lot of heat and it neither smelled nor sang but the way it wailed and screamed as it burned put off all but a few no among the woodtrolls lufwood was by far the most popular it burned well and they found its purple glow restful twig yawned as spelda continued her story her voice was highpitched but guttural it seemed to gurgle in the back of her throat 8216at four months you were already walking upright8217 she was saying and twig heard the pride in his mother8217s words most woodtroll children remained down on their knuckles until they were at least eighteen months old 8216but 8217 twig whispered softly drawn back inside the story despite himself he was already anticipating the next part it was time for the 8216but8217 every time it arrived twig would shudder and hold his breath 8216but8217 she said 8216although you were so ahead of the others physically you would not speak three years old you were and not a single word8217 she shifted round in her chair 8216and i don8217t have to tell you how serious that can be8217 once again his mother sighed once again twig screwed up his face in disgust something taghair had once said came back to him 8216your nose knows where you belong8217 twig had taken it to mean that he would always recognize the unique smell of his own home but what if he was wrong what if the wise old oakelf had been saying 8212 in his usual roundabout way 8212 that because his nose didn8217t like what it smelled this was not his home twig swallowed guiltily this was something he had wished so often as he8217d lain in his bunk after yet another day of being teased and taunted and bullied through the window the sun was sinking lower in the dappled sky the zigzag silhouettes of the deepwood pines were glinting like frozen bolts of lightning twig knew there would be snow before his father returned that night he thought of tuntum out there in the deepwoods far beyond the anchor tree perhaps at that very moment he was sinking his axe into the trunk of a bloodoak twig shuddered his father8217s felling tales had filled him with deep horror on many a howling night although he was a master carver tuntum snatchwood earned most of his money from the illicit repair of the sky pirates8217 ships this meant using buoyant wood 8212 and the most buoyant wood of all was bloodoak twig was uncertain of his father8217s feelings towards him whenever twig returned to the cabin with a bloodied nose or blacked eyes or clothes covered in slung mud he wanted his father to wrap him up in his arms and soothe the pain away instead tuntum would give him advice and make demands 8216bloody their noses8217 he said once 8216black their eyes and throw not mud but dung show them what you8217re made of8217 later when his mother was smoothing hyleberry salve onto his bruises she would explain that tuntum was only concerned to prepare him for the harshness of the world outside but twig was unconvinced it was not concern he had seen in tuntum8217s eyes but contempt twig absentmindedly wound a strand of his long dark hair round and round his finger as spelda went on with her story
