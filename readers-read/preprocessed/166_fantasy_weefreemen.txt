 a clang well done some things start before other things it was a summer shower but didnt appear to know it and it was pouring rain as fast as a winter storm miss perspicacia tick sat in what little shelter a raggedy hedge could give her and explored the universe she didnt notice the rain witches dried out quickly the exploring of the universe was being done with a couple of twigs tied together with string a stone with a hole in it an egg one of miss ticks stockings which also had a hole in it a pin a piece of paper and a tiny stub of pencil unlike wizards witches learn to make do with a little the items had been tied and twisted together to make a device it moved oddly when she prodded it one of the sticks seemed to pass right through the egg for example and came out the other side without leaving a mark yes she said quietly as rain poured off the rim of her hat there it is a definite ripple in the walls of the world very worrying theres probably another world making contact thats never good i ought to go there but according to my left elbow theres a witch there already shell sort it out then said a small and for now mysterious voice from somewhere near her feet no it cant be right thats chalk country over that way said miss tick you cant grow a good witch on chalk the stuffs barely harder than clay you need good hard rock to grow a witch believe me miss tick shook her head sending raindrops flying but my elbows are generally very reliable why talk about it lets go and see said the voice were not doing very well around here are we that was true the lowlands werent good to witches miss tick was making pennies by doing bits of medicine and misfortune telling and slept in barns most nights shed twice been thrown into ponds i cant barge in she said not on another witchs territory that never ever works but she paused witches dont just turn up out of nowhere lets have a look she pulled a cracked saucer out of her pocket and tipped into it the rainwater that had collected on her hat then she took a bottle of ink out of another pocket and poured in just enough to turn the water black she cupped it in her hands to keep the raindrops out and listened to her eyes tiffany aching was lying on her stomach by the river tickling trout she liked to hear them laugh it came up in bubbles a little way away where the riverbank became a sort of pebble beach her brother wentworth was messing around with a stick and almost certainly making himself sticky anything could make wentworth sticky washed and dried and left in the middle of a clean floor for five minutes wentworth would be sticky it didnt seem to come from anywhere he just got sticky but he was an easy child to mind provided you stopped him from eating frogs there was a small part of tiffanys brain that wasnt too certain about the name tiffany she was nine years old and felt that tiffany was going to be a hard name to live up to besides shed decided only last week that she wanted to be a witch when she grew up and she was certain tiffany just wouldnt work people would laugh another and larger part of tiffanys brain was thinking of the word susurrus it was a word that not many people have thought about ever as her fingers rubbed the trout under its chin she rolled the word round and round in her head susurrus according to her grandmothers dictionary it meant a low soft sound as of whispering or muttering tiffany liked the taste of the word it made her think of mysterious people in long cloaks whispering important secrets behind a door susurruss susurrusss shed read the dictionary all the way through no one told her you werent supposed to as she thought this she realized that the happy trout had swum away but something else was in the water only a few inches from her face it was a round basket no bigger than half a coconut shell coated with something to block up the holes and make it float a little man only six inches high was standing up in it he had a mass of untidy red hair into which a few feathers beads and bits of cloth had been woven he had a red beard which was pretty much as bad as the hair the rest of him that wasnt covered with blue tattoos was covered with a tiny kilt and he was waving a fist at her and shouting crivens gang awa oot o here ye daft wee hinny ware the green heid with that he pulled at a piece of string that was hanging over the side of his boat and a second redheaded man surfaced gulping air nae time for fishin said the first man hauling him aboard the green heids coming crivens said the swimmer water pouring off him lets offski and with that he grabbed one very small oar and with rapid back and forth movements made the basket speed away excuse me tiffany shouted are you fairies but there was no answer the little round boat had disappeared in the reeds probably not tiffany decided then to her dark delight there was a susurrus there was no wind but the leaves on the alder bushes by the riverbank began to shake and rustle so did the reeds they didnt bend they just blurred everything blurred as if something had picked up the world and was shaking it the air fizzed people whispered behind closed doors
