 excerpt chapter one two months later san diego california friday december 2 2005 lindsey fontaine knocked on her boss8217s door it was ajar so she pushed it open peeking in 8220you wanted to see me sir8221 she started but then realized there was someone in a navy uniform sitting across from his desk 8220oh i8217m sorry8221 8220no come on in linds8221 her boss tom paoletti waved her into the room 8220you8217ve met mark jenkins haven8217t you8221 8220not officially8221 lindsey told him she8217d seen jenkins earlier this morning hanging out at the new receptionist8217s desk reading rank wasn8217t one of her strengths but tom was a former navy seal his company troubleshooters incorporated did a great deal of business with the government including the military which meant lots of uniforms walked through their door the very young man8212jeez were they really taking them this fresh out of diapers these days8212pushing himself to his feet while favoring his left side was a petty officer first class and oh yes he was definitely firstclass8212in more ways than one extra cute with muscles but wait his rank meant he8217d been in the navy for a number of years because petty officers started at third class and worked their way up to first and that meant he couldn8217t be as young as he looked shame on her for making assumptions she should8217ve known better8212as someone who still got carded at the movies when she went to see an rrated film lindsey knew firsthand what a pain in the butt it was to look far younger than her years 8220nice to meet you lindsey8221 jenkins said as he shook her hand good grip solid eye contact pretty pretty hazel eyes great smile cute freckles and not too tall either she liked him already except for the fact that he was clearly infatuated with tracy shapiro troubleshooters incorporated8217s remarkably inept new receptionist of course most men seemed to turn into idiots around women who looked like tracy the brainless hairdo not that lindsey had exchanged more than a casual greeting with tracy who8217d started working there just a few days ago but there was no doubt about it tracy had set lindsey8217s brainless hairdoometer clacking right away it might8217ve had something to do with tracy bumming five bucks for lunch off of alyssa8212after flatout flirting with alyssa8217s husband sam but okay to be fair it wasn8217t the flirtingwithsam part that was a problem alyssa had to be good and used to that the real hairdo action came from tracy lamenting her lack of money for lunch accepting a fiver from alyssa with only the vaguest of promises to pay it back and then without taking a breath launching into an explanation of how she8217d seen the shoes she was wearing on sale and she just had to buy them and could they believe she8217d actually gotten them for only three hundred dollars when lindsey came to work she wore sneakers or clunkyheeled boots bought on sale for 2995 so no she could not believe that any pair of shoes even those made by mermaids off the coast of sicily could be worth three hundred dollars 8220jenk found tracy for us8221 tom paoletti told lindsey now 8220they were friends back in high school8221 8220ah8221 she said they were friends back in high school was guy code for jenk had always wanted to jump her bones apparently he hadn8217t given up trying he no doubt thought helping her get a job might work 8220that explains it8221 oops she probably shouldn8217t have said that aloud 8220i mean i8217m sure she8217s just feeling her way first days and all8221 lindsey added putting on what she hoped would be perceived as an optimistic expression 8220i mean we8217ve all had 8217em right first days kind of scary kind of overwhelming 8221 8220absolutely8221 jenk said flashing her a grateful smile and first days of work had to be doubly hard for tracy who8217d apparently been intercepted midway through her quest to see the wizard and finally get a brain cleverly lindsey didn8217t say that aloud 8220have a seat8221 tom ordered in that easygoing way he had of making a demand sound like an invitation she sat jenkins sat too tom paoletti was the best boss lindsey had ever had not only was he goodlooking in that captainpicardmakeitso baldmencanbesexy way but he was also smart and unbelievably kind maybe too kind lindsey made a mental note to offer to volunteer to fire tracy for him after the past few years she8217d had firing someone would be a cakewalk she wouldn8217t even blink she8217d mention that to tom later when mark jenkins wasn8217t around 8220we8217re going to be playing the part of red cell8212the terrorists8212in a training op with seal team sixteen8221 tom told her now 8220jenk is going to be liaison as we work out the logistics8221 8220really8221 lindsey looked at the seal 8220how 8221 convenient she was about to say since his being liaison would give him even more access to tracy except tracy was not a multitasker and his distracting presence would be far less convenient for everyone else in the office she for one was extremely tired of answering the phones because tracy had managed to screw up the voice mail system again 8220interesting8221 she said instead because they were both waiting for her to finish her sentence dayam the freckles across jenk8217s nose were positively adorable especially when he frowned combined with those hazel eyes rimmed by thick dark lashes he was beyond cute but it was probably in a way that he himself hated babyfaced cute his mouth tightened slightly because he misunderstood her comment interesting 8220i8217m twentyeight years old8221 8220oh8221 she said 8220no i wasn8217t82128221 8220you were wondering8221 jenk said 8220i could see that you were wondering so now you know i8217m old enough to vote8221 8220actually i wasn8217t wondering8221 lindsey glanced at tom who smiled apparently in no hurry to talk about that training op red cell that was going to be some kind of fun 8220i mean i was earlier but then i did the math figuring that you probably went to college and then i had you at more like thirty if you want to know the truth8221 she8217d surprised him 8220you really thought 8221 she shrugged 8220hey without makeup i look about twelve8221 he looked at her8212really looked 8220being flatchested helps with the illusion8221 she said 8220i8217m five feet and threeeighths of an inch tall8212you better believe i count every eighth i8217m also the same age as my bra size821230a the a is for my fouroh average at ucla which i attended before my seven years with the lapd8221 she smiled at him 8220i8217m one of tom8217s best bodyguards by the way i specialize in the protection of people who might not want their friends business associates andor enemies to know they8217re being protected because i could tell that you were wondering8221 she8217d stunned him so she turned to tom who was now flatout grinning 8220red cell huh so you called me in here boss because you want me to play the part of dr evil the terrorist mastermind right8221 lindsey liked tom for a lot of reasons but particularly because she made him laugh some people didn8217t get her sense of humor although cutiepie jenkins seemed to be on the same page after he8217d shaken off his shock 8220sorry i8217m the terrorist mastermind of this one8221 tom told her 8220it was a direct request from admiral tucker8221 ah 8220which makes me 8221 she let her voice trail off 8220mini me8221 tom laughed again 8220tempting but no not quite8221 uhoh 8220please don8217t say that i8217m82128221 he spoke in unison with her 8220the hostage8221 lindsey stared at him 8220someone8217s got to be the hostage8221 tom pointed out undaunted by her scathing disbelief 8220yeah but come on how realistic is it for the hostage to weigh only ninetytwo pounds8221 she leaned forward to argue 8220don8217t you want to give the seals a challenge8221 lindsey turned to jenk 8220tell him you want a challenge tell him you want i don8217t know sam starrett to play the hostage what is he six and a half feet tall two ten now if only he had a heart condition too he8217d be a perfect hostage8221 8220this time it8217s going to be you8221 tom told her she knew when to stop pushing so instead she sighed heavily 8220all right8221 8220we8217ll talk more later8221 tom said four little words made even more intriguing by the gleam in his eyes was it possible she was going to be more than the hostage suddenly this was back to maybe being fun maybe 8220i just wanted you to meet jenk8221 tom continued 8220if he needs help with the scheduling8212or really anything8221 he added addressing jenkins directly 8220he8217s going to come to you linds8221 oh good she was going to get to be the secretary as well as the hostage helping out with scheduling whoofreakin8217hoo she would have complained that she never saw tom assigning sam starrett to help out with the scheduling8212except for the fact that sam was bitching about tom giving him a similar task just last week 8220i was thinking it might be a good idea to have the two teams meet sometime in the next week8221 jenk suggested 8220maybe over at the ladybug lounge8221 8220really8221 lindsey was skeptical 8220that doesn8217t seem very realistic meeting in advance at a bar8221 hello osama can the boys in your san diego sleeper cell make it to a party on tuesday night 8220this is a silver bullet assignment8221 jenk informed her then translated 8220just short of rampr or it was supposed to be before admiral tucker got it into his head that it would be a kick to pit tommy here against the new co of team sixteen8221 yikes lindsey looked at her boss 8220your old team versus your new8221 she asked 8220that8217s gotta suck for your old team8221 she turned back to jenk 8220we are so going to kick your butts8221 8220yeah i don8217t think so we8217re seals and8212no offense tommy8212commander koehl8217s a good co so82128221 8220the poor guy8221 lindsey said 8220because like isn8217t team sixteen still referred to as 8216tom8217s team8217 i mean that8217s gotta sting koehl8217s been there what at least a year already that must be frustrating and now if he loses8212when he loses82128221 tom interrupted 8220training ops are not about winning and losing they8217re about learning about improving8221 lindsey looked at jenk who was looking back at lindsey with an expression equally disbelieving not about winning who did tom think he was kidding 8220and yes8221 tom continued 8220this was supposed to be fun so let8217s see if we can8217t find the time for that social event don8217t forget to invite lew koehl let8217s try to downplay the winning and losing thing starting right here and now8221 lindsey looked over at jenk again 8220i8217m down with learning8221 she said even as she gazed pointedly at the spot where his rear was planted in that chair making a tiny kicking motion with her foot 8220totally into improving8221 he agreed shooting her back a discreet l for loser shaped with his thumb and forefinger out of tom8217s line of sight lindsey couldn8217t help it she laughed covering it quickly with a cough tom of course wasn8217t fooled he rubbed his forehead 8220i8217m serious people this is going to be at best difficult both for commander koehl and for me i want you working together let8217s turn this into a win for everyone8221 he smiled tightly 8220except maybe admiral tucker8221 8220we should look at a calendar8221 jenk told lindsey 8220and exchange cell phone numbers8221 those words coming from those lips should have made her heart beat harder mark jenkins wanted her phone number he was cute and funny and smart8212and tremendously flawed he had after all the hots for the hairdo and his wanting lindsey8217s number was purely workrelated no doubt about it he was lindsey8217s type perfectly cleanly out of reach unless of course he got a little drunk and ended up going home with lindsey as his solid second choice oh yeah if she played her cards right she could get totally skewered by this one although it had been quite some time since she8217d been skewered8212or preskewered which was far more enjoyable still a little distance would probably be prudent 8220wouldn8217t tracy be a better person to assist jenkins with this8221 she suggested even as she took one of the troubleshooters incorporated business cards off of the little holder on tom8217s desk she wrote her number on the back 8220i mean i8217m happy to do it of course i was just thinking since they8217re you know old friends82218212wink wink82128220jenk might appreciate spending time with her8221 jenkins liked that idea 8220thanks8221 he said pocketing the business card still rummaging for one of his own yeah she had been right about him favoring one side he definitely didn8217t have full range of motion in his left arm her own shoulder8212her right one8212twinged in sympathy if she hadn8217t just decided to keep her distance she could8217ve given him some rehab and recovery tips tom meanwhile wasn8217t as thrilled as jenk was about her tracy idea 8220you8217re the official ts inc liaison8221 he told lindsey 8220if i need answers i8217m going to come to you but you can absolutely let tracy help that8217s what she8217s been hired to do in fact you can use this opportunity to get to know her help bring her up to speed8221 oh whee tom was an excellent leader he was capable of reading his subordinates even when like lindsey was doing right now they were wearing their best poker faces 8220we8217ll talk about that later as well8221 he said 8220i8217ve got a few more things to discuss with jenk8221
