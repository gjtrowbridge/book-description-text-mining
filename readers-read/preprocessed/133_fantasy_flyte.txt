 chapter one spiders septimus heap tipped six spiders into a jar screwed the lid down tight and put them outside the door then he picked up his broom and continued sweeping out the pyramid library the library was cramped and dark it was lit by a few fat candles that spat and spluttered and it smelled weird a mixture of incense musty paper and moldy leather septimus loved it it was a magykal place perched right at the top of the wizard tower and hidden away deep inside the golden pyramid which crowned the tower outside the hammered gold of the pyramid shimmered brightly in the earlymorning sun after septimus had finished sweeping he made his way slowly along the shelves humming happily to himself while he sorted out the magykal books parchments and spells that the extraordinary wizard marcia overstrand had as usual left in a mess most elevenandahalfyearold boys would rather have been out in the bright summer morning but septimus was where he wanted to be he had spent quite enough summer mornings outside and winter ones come to that in the first ten years of his life as young army soldier boy 412 it was septimuss job as apprentice to the extraordinary wizard to tidy the library every morning and every morning septimus found something new and exciting often it was something that marcia had left out especially for him maybe a conjuration that she had come across late at night and thought might interest him or a dogeared old spell book that she had taken from one of the hidden shelves but today septimus reckoned he had found something for himself it was stuck underneath a heavy brass candlestick and looked slightly disgusting not the kind of thing that marcia overstrand would want to get her hands messy with very carefully he pried the sticky brown square off the bottom of the candlestick and put it in the palm of his hand septimus examined his find and felt excited he was sure it was a taste charm the thick brown square tablet looked like an old piece of chocolate it smelled like an old piece of chocolate and he was pretty sure it would taste like an old piece of chocolate too although he wasnt going to risk it there was a chance it might be a poison charm that had dropped out of the large box labeled toxins venoms and basyk banes which teetered unsteadily on the shelf above septimus pulled out a small enhancing glass from his apprentice belt and held it so that he could read the thin white writing that looped across the square the words said take me shake me and i will make thee quetzalcoatls tchocolatl septimus grinned he was right but then he usually was when it came to magyk it was a taste charm even better it was a chocolate taste charm septimus knew just the person he wanted to give it to smiling to himself he slipped the charm into his pocket septimuss work in the library was nearly done he climbed up the ladder to tidy the last shelf and suddenly found himself eye to eye with the biggest hairiest spider he had ever seen septimus gulped if it had not been for marcia insisting on him removing every single spider that he found from the library he would happily have left this one alone he was sure the spiders eight beady eyes were trying to stare him down and he didnt like its long hairy legs either in fact all eight legs looked as though they were planning to run up his sleeve if he didnt grab the spider fast in a flash septimus had the spider in his hand the creature scrabbled angrily against his dusty fingers trying to pry them open with its surprisingly powerful legs but septimus held on tight quickly he made his way down the ladder passing the small hatch that led out onto the golden roof of the pyramid just as he reached the bottom of the ladder the spider bit the inside of his thumb ouch septimus yelped he grabbed the spider jar unscrewed the lid onehanded and dropped the creature in much to the dismay of the six other spiders already there then with his thumb beginning to throb septimus screwed the lid back on as tightly as he could careful not to drop the jar in which six small spiders were now being chased around and around by one large hairy one septimus made a quick exit down the winding narrow stone stairs which led from the library into the apartment of the extraordinary wizard madam marcia overstrand septimus hurried by the closed purple and gold door to marcias bedroom past his own room and then ran down some more steps and headed for the small potion room beside marcias study he put down the jar of spiders and looked at his thumb it wasnt a pretty sight it had become a deep red color and some interesting blue blotches were beginning to appear on his hand it also hurt septimus flipped open the medicine chest with his good hand and found a tube of spider balm the entire contents of which he squeezed over his thumb it didnt seem to do much good in fact it seemed to make it worse septimus stared at his thumb which was swelling up like a small balloon and felt as though it might be about to explode marcia overstrand whom septimus had now been apprenticed to for almost a year and a half had found the spiders waiting for her on her triumphant return to the wizard tower after ousting the necromancer domdaniel from his brief second time as extraordinary wizard marcia had thoroughly cleaned the tower of darke magyk and restored the magyk to the wizard tower but she could not get rid of the spiders this had upset marcia for she knew that the spiders were a sure sign that darke magyk still lingered in the tower
