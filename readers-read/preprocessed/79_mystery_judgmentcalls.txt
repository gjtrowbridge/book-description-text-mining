 excerpt chapter 1 a february morning in portland oregon and it was still dark outside when i walked into the courthouse the air thick with the annoying drops of humidity that pass for rain in the pacific northwest no surprises there what did surprise me was finding a police bureau sergeant waiting in my office im a deputy district attorney for multnomah county making me about one percent of the office that prosecutes state crimes committed in the portland area since i took this job three years ago ive gotten used to having voice mail and email messages waiting for me on monday mornings people just dont seem to realize that government law offices arent open on weekends its unusual though and rarely a good sign to find a cop waiting for you first thing in the morning at least i knew this one quothey garcia who let you inquot i said quoti thought we had some security around herequot sergeant tommy garcia looked up from the oregon state bar magazine he had lifted out of my inbox he smiled at me with those bright white perfectly straight teeth that contrasted beautifully with his smooth olive skin that smile had led me to believe he was a nice guy when i met him for the first time three years ago and i had been right quothey sammie what can i say i love reading the part at the back that tells about all the bad lawyers and what they did to get disbarred or suspended gives me a sense of justice you should be careful about giving me such a hard time though i might start to think youre like the rest of the das around here with a stick up your assquot tommys in charge of the bureaus vice unit so i know him well as a member of the eightlawyer team known as the drug and vice division i talk to tommy almost weekly about pending cases and see him at least once a month at team meetings quotyou must want something from me big and bad garcia to be buttering me up like that what is itquot i asked quota warrantquot the local judges wont even read an officers application for a search warrant unless it is reviewed and approved first by a deputy da in a close case the cops tend to quotda shopquot garcia laughed quotyoure too smart kincaid nope no warrant i do need your help on something but its a little more complicatedquot he reached behind him to shut the door looking at me first to make sure i didnt mind quotmct picked a case up over the weekend thinking it would be an attempt murder the suspects are bad bad guys sammie two of them grabbed a girl out of old town one of them started to rape her but couldnt get it up so he beat her instead and then the second guy finished what the first couldnt when they were done they left her for dead out in the columbia gorge quoti dont know all the details but apparently the initial investigation was a bit of a cluster fuck it sounds like everythings on track now but odonnell was the riding da and got pissed off at some of the early mistakes so hes planning on kicking it into the general felony unit for prosecution you can pretty much figure out whats gonna happen to itquot the general felony trial unit is a dumping ground for cases that arent seen as serious the trial ddas often have extremely limited time to spend on them and the overwhelming majority plead out to reduced charges and stipulated sentences during a fastpaced court calendar referred to as quotmorning callquot its the criminal justice systems ugly side tim odonnell was a senior dda in the major crimes unit if he bumped a major crimes team case down to general he knew it was gone quotsounds bad but it also sounds like mcts beef is with odonnellquot quotyeah well odonnells minds not an easy one to change and i think theres another way to go here because of a vice angle the victims a thirteenyearold prostitute named kendra martin unlike most of em she doesnt try to look any older wears schoolgirl outfits like that one girl used to wear on mtv before she got implants and started running around naked whats her name my daughter likes her anyway she looks her age is my point quotturns out her injuries werent as bad as they first looked so the mct guys know itll be hard to get attempted murder to stick but they kept working the case even after they realized that they couldve handed it off to precinct detectives this case is under their skinquot any reluctance on the part of the major crimes team to hand over a case to precinct detectives was understandable in theory regular shift detectives are perfectly good investigators but in reality disappointed precinct detectives who were passed over for the elite mct frequently drop the ball deciding their cases must not be sufficiently quotmajorquot to warrant good investigations quoti dont doubt their earnestness but i still dont see why theyd come to dvd with this let alone to me ive never even handled an mct casequot quotthey figured because of the vice connection that someone in dvd might take the case from odonnell and run with it on something more serious than a general felony and ive been watching you since you got here kincaid youre good and this could be a case for you to show what you can do when given the chancequot quotdont think you can play me like that garcia i know an ego stroke when i see itquot of course recognizing the stroke for what it was didnt prevent me from succumbing to it the truth was he was right id been eager to get my hands on a major trial its a nowin situation dvd cases arent sexy enough to prove yourself to the guys running this place yet youre supposed to prove yourself before you can try victim cases garcia was dangling a way for me to beat the system i wasnt about to sign on for this though without knowing the details quoti dont think theres much i can do about it but im willing to talk have someone call mequot i asked quoti can do better than thatquot he said quoti got two mct detectives waiting for you down the streetquot garcia mustve known hed be able to work me he had told detectives jack walker and raymond johnson to wait for us at the cafeteria in the basement of the federal building created to provide subsidized meals to lowlevel government workers the cafeteria had found a cultlike following among the citys law enforcement crowd a threedollar tray of grease dished out by lunch ladies in hairnets had a certain retro appeal i exercised some moderation and got a bowl of oatmeal while garcia waited for his plate to be loaded up with bacon and home fries after hed paid for our meals he led me to a corner table quotjack walker raymond johnson this is samantha kincaidquot i shook their hands jack walker was a beefy man in his fifties starting to lose his hair with a full mustache his shortsleeved dress shirt stretched tight across his belly the buttons pulling in front his grip was almost painfully firm and his palms were rough he looked like a cop through and through johnson was a different story altogether a tall wellbuilt african american in his midthirties raymond johnson looked and dressed like a gq model he wore a collarless shirt with a threebutton charcoal suit his hair was closecropped and he wore a diamond stud in his left ear he shook my hand and held it just a little longer than necessary which was fine with me quotits nice to meet you bothquot i said quotive seen you around the courthouse but i dont think weve ever actually metquot jack walker spoke first quotyeah likewise ive been hearing a lot of good things about you from tommy here and chuck forbes says you guys go way backquot suddenly johnsons handshake made a little more sense to say that chuck forbes and i go way back is to sanitize the situation considerably i didnt think chuck would tell all to his cop buddies but i wouldnt be surprised if he had said something in a certain way with that grin of his that would clue a guy like raymond johnson in to the gist of his reminiscing i hoped i wasnt blushing well i dont want to disappoint you but its a long shot that ill be able to helpquot i asked them to tell me about the case from the beginning and johnson took over we got the call around three on sunday morning a group of high school kids went out near multnomah falls to party they were all pretty drunk and a couple of them hiked into the forest to get it on the girl tripped over what she thought was a log turns out the log was kendra martinnbsp he explained the facts in detail i could see why he enjoyed a reputation among the ddas as one of the bureaus best witnesses quotshe was wearing a bra and a skirt pulled up over her hips nothing else no purse no id real beat up finger marks on her neck blood coming out of her bottom i looked down trying to hide my discomfort johnson continued the kids called police and medical looking at her everyone assumed the worst her pulse was slow she wasnt moving or talking her face and body were covered with blood the med techs took her straight to emanuel legacy and patrol cops called in mct we page odonnell and tell him what we have and he says we dont need a da to come out we dont have a suspect in custody yet and the scene where we found the vic even if it turns out to be the crime scene is already fucked up by the high school kids he tells us to keep working and to page him if we get a suspect or if anything big comes up over the weekendquot this was promising to be a long meeting if johnson didnt speed it up so i broke in quothowd you guys split up the investigationquot chuck and his partner mike calabrese supervised patrol in securing the scene and jack and i went to emanuel to follow up with the vic by the time we arrive shes been there almost an hour and doing a lot better the er doc told us that most of the blood was from the anal tearing and a single large laceration on her face she was out of it and had a slow pulse because she was on heroin to be on the safe side the doctor gave her narcan to knock the heroin out of her system and keep her from oding she was bruised up pretty bad but she was basically ok by the time we got to the hospitalquot quotso thats when you realized it wasnt a major crimes team case after allquot i said letting them know that garcia had already filled me in on the jurisdictional problems jack walker responded as the senior detective he probably felt the need to justify the decision to keep the case with mct depends on how you look at it yeah if patrol had known at the scene what the vics actual injuries were they probably wouldnt have called us out but once we got involved we had a teenage vic saying that a couple guys pulled her into their car and raped and beat her she told the doc she didnt know how heroin wound up in her system that they must have injected her during the assault without her realizing it it looked like a straight strangertostranger kidnap doping rape and sod of a little girl it didnt seem right to bump the case down to shift detectivesquot quotwhat charge did you use to hang on to the case attempted murderquot i asked walker nodded yeah we decided we had enough actually its an attempted agg since the girls under fourteenquot intentionally killing a person under fourteen is aggravated murder which can carry a death sentence luckily kendra martin didnt die so the defendants would at most be charged with attempted aggravated murder quotso what did you do after you decided to keep the casequot i asked johnson answered we go in to talk to her and im telling you the girl was a real piece of work cussing us out calling us every name in the book accusing us of keeping her there against her will when there was nothing wrong with her so scf would make her go homequot runaways were notoriously distrustful of the states services for children and families department quotshe wasnt making a lot of sense so we had to explain to her that we were there to investigate her statement to the doctor that calmed her down a little still pretty bitchy thoughquot johnson caught himself and looked over at garcia for a read on his choice of words i assured him his candor was fine and asked him to continue as i pulled a legal pad from my briefcase anyway the vic initially said she was walking in old town around ten on saturday night on her way to powells books when suspect one comes up from behind and pushes her into the backseat of what she called a he looked down at his notebook some big seventies fourdoor loser shit box said it was a dark color suspect one gets in back with her while suspect two drives to a parking lot somewhere in southeast portland she says suspect one acted like the one in charge he starts getting real rough with her in the backseat saying a lot of dirty stuff and pulling her clothes off thing is right when she thinks hes about to rape her she realizes theres nothing there the guy cant get it up so he just goes off and starts beating the shit out of her then penetrates her vaginally and anally with a foreign object she cant tell what the doctors say it was probably some kind of stick they found splinters anyway they left the parking lot and got onto i84 going east she remembers passing signs to the airport after they stopped were guessing they were out by multnomah falls at this point suspect one tells suspect two to take a turn at her she thinks he penetrated her vaginally and remembers suspect one telling him to finish off in her mouth her memory of what happened toward the end was pretty hazy she also thinks they mustve taken her purse because she had it with her when they pulled her in the carquot i felt sick its bad enough that people like these men walk on the same planet as the rest of us the fact that they manage to find one another and work together is utterly terrifying quotcould she describe the suspectsquot ray johnson nodded quotnothing helpful just that shed know them if she saw them again we figure its a long shot but go ahead and pull some mug shots off ximaging of guys on supervision for child sods and strangertostranger rapes one of ppbs newest toys ximaging is a computerized data system that stores all booking photos taken in the state by using the computer to select booking photos corresponding to certain mos an officer is more likely to get a successful identification from a witness than by dumping several hundred booking photos in front of her i could tell from johnsons voice that in this case the strategy had hit pay dirt shes flipping through the printouts and hones right in on one guy frank derringer i swear it was one of the best mugshot ids ive ever seen i mean youve seen how it goes with that many pictures most wits start to get confused this girl is just flipping through em left and right and then bam she nails it one hundred percent certain thats him she said pointed right at derringers mugquot johnson was getting excited now quotwe get even more worked up when we see that derringers the guy we pulled who was just paroled last summer on an attempted sod of a fifteenyearold girl unfortunately for derringer this girl had just started a kick boxing class as he was pushing her down she popped up and landed a roundhouse kick straight to his adams apple and got away he only served a year because it was an attempt but it shows the guys got it in him we called odonnell at that point and told him what we had he gives us the ok to pick up derringer we picked him up last night around seven his parole officer dave renshaw went out there with us the plan was to arrest derringer on a parole violation for having unsupervised contact with a minor child then write paper to search the apartmentquot i interrupted quotdoes derringer have any cars registered to himquot johnson nodded that wouldve been too easy we ran him only car registered to him is an eightytwo ford escortnbsp it was his associated vehicle until a couple years ago probably when he went to the pen since then it comes up as associated with one of derringers pals guys gotten three duis in two years in that same carquot quotyou know how these guys arequot walker said quotthey sell their pieces of junk to each other and never bother notifying dmvquot quotso is that all you had when you went out to the house the victims idquot walker appeared to share my frustration yeah thats about it but i dont know what more we couldve gotten before we went out they did a rape kit at the hospital but according to the victims version theres probably no semen to get a sample from derringer never did her even if the other guy left behind some preejaculatory liquid or they get something from the oral swab it can take about a week for a pcr analysisquot what about blood if the victim drew any blood fighting the hospital could identify the blood type in a matter ofnbspminutes johnson shook his head nah the vic was too doped up to put up a fight so she didnt have any evidence under her fingernails or draw any blood from them we did have a couple things to corroborate her story as luck would have it calabrese found the victims purse in a trash can by the road about a half mile from where they dropped her he and forbes were thinking the bad guys maybe dumped the stick on the way out good thinking but no luck but finding the purse showed that martin was remembering at least some details accuratelyquot my face must have revealed my skepticism quoti dont want to sound like ive made up my mind but thats pretty weak corroboration detective it just shows kendra was robbed it doesnt say anything about who did this to her were there any prints on the pursequot quotwe dont know yet weve got it down at the lab being looked at with the rest of the girls clothesquot quotok so what you guys are telling me is that at least so far this case turns entirely on kendra martins identification of derringer do we all agree on thatquot they all nodded quotso when you went out to derringers apartment with his po did this case manage to get any betterquot the second the words came out i regretted them seasoned cops like jack walker and raymond johnson no doubt were well aware of the differences between their approach and a district attorneys cops just need to make the arrest the da is the one who has to prove the case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt afterward who has to deal with a defense attorney gnawing at every argument and challenging every piece of evidence trying a weak case can feel like getting poked in the eye for two weeks cops learn to live with the difference in perspective but they dont like being talked down to and i was pretty sure i had done just that quotno confession if thats what youre looking for damn it garcia i thought you said this girl was willing to try a close case were not even done giving her the facts and shes already shutting us downquot jack walker was clearly pissed off i chalked up the quotgirlquot comment to generational differences and swallowed my pride no use alienating these guys over a careless comment even one that irritated the hell out of me detective im sorry if my tone suggested that i was criticizing your investigation but to be honest im a little frustrated by what i am beginning to perceive as an attempt to portray the evidence as stronger than it really is look if the case is a real dog ill figure that out whether or not you lead it to me barking if its a gimme ill notice that too but i want to decide on my own with that said i apologize for my smartass comment i should have said exactly what i was thinking and now i have i hope you havent made up your mind about me just as i havent formed a final decision about your casequot the table was quiet as garcia and johnson waited to see if i had managed to make things worse then jack walker shook his head and smiled well that was definitely direct and youre right i guess we were kind of hyping the case up a little he glanced over at johnson not so much with a look of blame as like a child who pecks over at his partnerinmischief when he realizes the teacher has figured them outnbspbut good walker then looked directly at me and i could tell wed entered a spinfree zone quotlook the truth is the biggest thing weve got right now is the girls id of derringer derringer denied everything he says he was over at his brothers watching a basketball game and then stayed for saturday night live and some beers the brothers name is derrick derringer if you can believe it anyway so far derricks corroborating his brother but hes got three felony convictions so there you goquot quotso did you arrest derringer at his housequot i asked walker shook his head not us renshaw hooked derringer up on a parole violation based on kendras id and took him down to the justice center for booking we figured the parole detainer would at least hold him overnight when odonnell could decide what charges to filequot quotand what did odonnell make of all thisquot detective walker slumped back in his chair the excitement draining from his face thats where this whole thing fell apart on us after we had derringer hooked up we went back to central to meet chuck and mike they had finished processing the scene and were working on the warrant just as were finishing up odonnell shows up in a fucking suit to review the warrant hes reading it just nodding the whole time not saying squat then he says what about this girl so ray and i explain how she started out like a pill but then was a complete ten on the id odonnell didnt like it said the case rested entirely on the girl then he asks whether weve run herquot quotyoud finished the warrant and still hadnt run herquot walker pursed his lips and shook his head quoti know we fucked up wed been up all night running around we assumed she was straight up when she picked a sick fuck like derringer we forgot about running her it was a rookie mistakequot johnson continued with the bad news when they ran the victim they found a few runaway reports and an arrest for loitering to solicit worse the cop who made the loitering pop found a syringe in the girls purse with heroin residue on it furious that the detectives had miscalculated their victim odonnell had tried to bully her into coming clean but his tough approach only made her dig her heels in deeper walker had to smooth things over with her and she eventually admitted to a ninemonth heroin habit that she worked the streets to support so its basically a trick gone bad i asked quotnoquot walker said quotat least we dont think so she admits she was walking old town looking for a trick shed just finished one up and had scored some horse on the street she figured shed keep working while she was high anyway these two guys pull up and offer her fifty bucks if they can highfive herquot quotok ive been working vice a few years now but i still dont know what a high five isquot i knew it had to be bad when walker and johnson looked to garcia for help and raised their eyebrows garcia averted his eyes while he told me quotits when a girl gets on all fours and one guy does her from behind while she blows the other onequot i was about to ask why the hell it was called a high five until i got a mental image of two naked guys on their knees giving each other a high five i rolled my eyes in disgust quotso they ask her to work for both of them basically and she goes with themquot walker eagerly accepted the invitation to change the subject quotnot according to her she says she told them to meet her in the parking lot of the motel at third and alder she rents a room there when she works she assumes theyve got a deal and starts walking to the hotel thats when derringer puts her into the backseat the rest of it happened pretty much like she said originally when the car was stopped and derringer was undoing his pants she tried getting out but the guy in front pushed her back in they told her she wasnt going anywhere and she may as well shoot up what was left in her purse so she did thing is she says it never dawned on her they were gonna kill her until derringer started to choke her out but my thinking is she knew it at some level when they pulled her back into the car she was just trying to get it over with she said she injected so much horse the assault didnt hurt that bad and this guy really worked her overquot ray johnson shook his head man you shouldve seen odonnell i dont know if you guys are tight but he can be one tightsphinctered prick he got all moralistic and lectured the entire team about our obligation to be cautious wielding the stem hand of the law quot johnsons nerdy white guy impersonation pretty much nailed tim odonnell anyway it was bullshit he continued odonnell had us clean up the warrant to include the new information and then signed off on it saying he was gonna kick it out of major crimes territory if we didnt find anything that changed his mind we found some porn but nothing damning so hes planning on filing it today as an assault three and assigning it to precinct detectives for general followup before grand juryquot i couldnt believe it all you had to prove for assault in the third degree was that two or more defendants acted together to injure another person it didnt begin to portray the savage acts that had been committed against kendra martin quotassault three thats itquot i said johnson nodded quoti know ridiculous he says the ids weak plus the defense can say the whole thing was a consensual trick that the girl cried rape so her mom wouldnt find out she was turning tricks for smack said he was only issuing the assault because of derringers prior he basically called the girl a piece of trashquot quotand you guys dont think she is you think shes telling the truthquot walker looked at me and tilted his head slightly ms kincaid i really do its almost in her favor that she lied to us at first shows she still knows that workings shameful not just a matteroffact thing to her maybe that logic doesnt make any sense to you but i think shes basically still a pretty good kid we pissed odonnell off by not reading the case right but hes taking it out on the case and this derringer dirtbag is going to get the benefitquot quoti agree that derringer needs to be done but im not sure how i can help youquot i wasnt surprised that sergeant garcia had a suggestion he had the respect of his fellow officers because he was a smart cop and a good guy in a bureau where most black and latino officers stall out at the front line of streetlevel enforcement administrative staff promoted him because he had a political savvy so smooth that its targets never even knew theyd been had quotthe way i see it this girl could be a good link for vice shes young and probably knows a circle of working girls we dont have access to if we can earn her trust she might be able to lead us to some of the pimps we havent been able to latch on to the guys who are turning out the real young ones ill call odonnell like i dont know much about the case but think it might have potential with vice then ask if he minds me getting mcts ok to approach the vic as a potential informant at that point i can sell him on letting a dvd attorney take the case so they have a head start if the vic winds up developing other contacts for us and then ill seal the deal unless ill say you want to keep the case yourself and help me flip any vice contacts i work quot johnson was impressed tommy my man you oughta run for president that is slick you in kincaidquot i dont mind taking the case but heres the problem it still needs major help the rape kits not back the victims clothes are still at the lab derringers alibi needs work and we still dont have the driver if this case is filed as an assault three its outside mct jurisdiction you know the precinct detectives arent going to do the followup thats neededquot garcia was a step ahead of me ill make another call to odonnell telling him that you want to file the case as a major crime so mct can keep working on it but that mct understands it might get bumped back down later onquot i hate this kind of crap the four people at the table agree what needs to happen and are willing to put in the work but have to plot how they can even start without bruising a fragile ego i was skeptical garcia was good but i still thought odonnell might see right through it and blame me when he wound up looking like a chicken shit it would have been so easy to blame odonnell for the bad decision and say there was nothing i could do apathy is grossly undervalued and never there for me when i need it i was already sucked in id broken up some escort services and prosecuted a few pimps but id never had a chance to handle a case like this one and to my mind with scum like derringer it was better to issue the case and lose than let him walk away up front quotalright lets give it a tryquot i said
