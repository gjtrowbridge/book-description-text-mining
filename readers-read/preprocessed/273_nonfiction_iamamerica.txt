 i am no fan of books and chances are if youre reading this you and i share a healthy skepticism about the printed word well i want you to know that this is the first book ive ever written and i hope its the first book youve ever read dont make a habit of it how many american flags can you find in this paragraph now you might ask yourself if by yourself you mean me stephen if you dont like books why did you write one you just asked yourself a trick question i didnt write it i dictated it i shouted it into a tape recorder over the columbus day weekend then handed it to my agent and said sell this hes the one who turned it into a book its his funeral but i get your drift why even dictate well like a lot of other dictators there is one mans opinion i value above all others mine and folks i have a lot of opinions im like lucy trying to keep up with the candy at the chocolate factory i can barely put them in my mouth fast enough in fact i have so many opinions i have overwhelmed my ability to document myself i thought my nightly broadcast the colbert report check your local listings would pick up some of the slack but heres the dirty little secret when the cameras go off im still talking and right now all that opinion is going to waste like seed on barren ground well no more its time to impregnate this country with my mind sorry marginhuggers but ive got some opinions over here too deal with it 1 see at one time america was pure men were men women were women and gays were confirmed bachelors but somewhere around the late 60s it became groovy to let it all hang out while you kept on truckin stopping only to give a hoot and today lady liberty is under attack from the cable channels the internet blogs and the hollywood celebritocracy out there spewing facts like so many locusts descending on americas crop of ripe tender values and as any farmer or biblical scholar will tell you locusts are damn hard to get rid of 2 you will need your confirmation number to log in i said on the very first episode of the colbert report that together i was going to change the world and ive kept up my end of the bargain but its not changing fast enough last time i checked my supermarket still sold yogurt from france see a pattern turns out it takes more than thirty minutes a night to fix everything thats destroying america and thats where this book comes in its not just some collection of reasoned arguments supported by facts thats the cowards way out half an hour not enough this book is truth my truth i deliver my truth hot and hard fast and furious so either accept it without hesitation or get out of the way because somebody might get hurt and its not going to be me its going to be you think you can handle it im scared of koreans bam thats me off the cuff blunt and in your face no editing i think it i say it you read it sometimes i dont even think it i just say it baby carrots are trying to turn me gay dont put this book down see im not pulling any punches im telling it like it is get used to it or put this book down because this book is for americas heroes and who are the heroes the people who bought this book that bears repeating people who borrow this book are not heroes they are no better then welfare queens mooching off the system like cardcarrying library cardcarriers for the record were not offering this book to libraries no free rides rides cost money okay now its my turn to ask a question what do i want from you good question thank you just because i havent put a lot of thought into this book doesnt mean you shouldnt i want you to read this book carefully savor my ideas memorize pertinent passages eat with it sleep with it let nature take its course because what i have dictated is nothing less than a constitution for the colbert nation and like our founding fathers i hold my truths to be selfevident which is why i did absolutely no research i didnt need to the only research i needed was a long hard look in the mirror for this book is my story and as such it is the american story minus the fruited plains see chapter 7homosexuals i am reminded of the words of walt whitman the nineteenthcentury poet naturalist and all around mans man who through his epic lyricism defined the character of this new nation he said i celebrate myself and sing myself and what i assume you shall assume that i he was talking about its me bottom line read this book be me i am america and so can you
