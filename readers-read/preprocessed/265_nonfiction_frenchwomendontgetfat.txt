 chapter 1 vive l8217am201rique the beginning i am overweight i love my adopted homeland but first as an exchange student in massachusetts i learned to love chocolatechip cookies and brownies and i gained twenty pounds my love affair with america had begun with my love of the english language we met at the lyc233e junior high and high school when i turned eleven english was my favorite class after french literature and i simply adored my english teacher he had never been abroad but spoke english without a french accent or even a british one he had learned it during world war ii when he found himself in a pow camp with a high school teacher from weston massachusetts i suspect they had long hours to practice without knowing whether they8217d make it out alive they decided that if they did they would start an exchange program for high school seniors each year one student from the united states would come to our town and one of us would go to weston the exchange continues to this day and the competition is keen during my last year at the lyc233e i had good enough grades to apply but i wasn8217t interested with dreams of becoming an english teacher or professor i was eager to start undergraduate studies at the local university and at eighteen naturally i had also convinced myself i was madly in love with a boy in my town he was the handsomest though admittedly not the brightest boy around the coqueluche the darling of all the girls i couldn8217t dream of parting from him so i didn8217t even think of applying for weston but in the schoolyard between classes there was hardly another topic of conversation among my friends the oddson favorite to go was monique she wanted it so badly and besides she was the best in our class a fact not lost on the selection committee which was chaired by my english teacher and included among its distinguished ranks pta members other teachers the mayor and the local catholic priest balanced by the protestant minister but on the monday morning when the announcement was expected the only thing announced was that no decision had been made at home that thursday morning those days there was no school on thursdays but half days on saturday my english teacher appeared at the door he had come to see my mother which seemed rather strange considering my good grades as soon as he left with a big satisfied smile but not a word to me except hello my mother called me something was tr232s important the selection committee had not found a suitable candidate when i asked about monique my mother tried to explain something not easily fathomed at my age my friend had everything going for her but her parents were communists and that would not fly in america the committee had debated at great length it was a small town where everybody was fully informed about everybody else but they could not escape concluding that a daughter of communists could never represent france my teacher had proposed me as an alternative and the other members had agreed but since i had not even applied he had to come and persuade my parents to let me go my overadoring father who would never have condoned my running away for a year was not home perhaps my teacher was counting on this fact but in any event he managed to sell the idea to my mother the real work then fell to her because she had to persuade not only my father but me as well not that she was without her own misgivings about seeing me go but mamie was always wise and farsighted and she usually got her way i was terribly anxious about what monique would say but once word got out she was first to declare what a fine ambassador i would make apparently communist families were quite open and practical about such matters and she had already been given to understand that family ideology had made her a dark horse from the start and so i went it was a wonderful year8212one of the best of my adolescence8212and it certainly changed the course of my entire life to a young french girl weston a wealthy boston suburb seemed an american dream8212green manicured spread out with huge gorgeous homes and welltodo wellschooled families there was tennis horseback riding swimming pools golf and two or three cars per family8212a far far cry from any town in eastern france then or now the time was so full of new unimagined things but finally too rich and i don8217t mean demographically for all the priceless new friends and experiences i was embracing something else altogether something sinister was slowly taking shape almost before i could notice it had turned into fifteen pounds more or less and quite probably more it was august my last month before the return voyage to france i was in nantucket with one of my adoptive families when i suffered the first blow i caught a reflection of myself in a bathing suit my american mother who had perhaps been through something like this before with another daughter instinctively registered my distress a good seamstress she bought a bolt of the most lovely linen and made me a summer shift it seemed to solve the problem but really only bought me a little time in my final american weeks i had become very sad at the thought of leaving all my new pals and relations but i was also quite apprehensive of what my french friends and family would say at the sight of the new me i had never mentioned the weight gain in letters and somehow managed to send photos showing me only from the waist up the moment of truth was approaching 2 la fille prodigue return of the prodigal daughter my father brought my brother with him to le havre to collect me i was traveling on the ss rotterdam the ocean liner was still the transatlantic standard preferred by many french people in the late 1960s with me was the new american exchange student from weston who would be spending the year in our town since he had not seen me for a whole year i expected my father who always wore his heart on his face would embarrass me bounding up the gangway for the first hug and kiss but when i spied the diminutive french man in his familiar beret8212yes a beret8212he looked stunned as i approached now a little hesitantly he just stared at me and as we came near after a few seconds that seemed endless there in front of my brother and my american shipmate all he could manage to say to his cherished little girl come home was 8220tu ressembles 224 un sac de patates8221 8220you look like a sack of potatoes8221 some things don8217t sound any prettier in french i knew what he had in mind not a marketsize sack but one of the big 150pound burlap affairs that are delivered to grocery stores and restaurants fortunately the girl from weston spoke little french else she would have had a troubling first impression of french family life at age nineteen i could not have imagined anything more hurtful and to this day the sting has not been topped but my father was not being mean true tact was never his strength and the teenage girl8217s hypersensitivity about weight and looks wasn8217t yet the proverbial pothole every parent today knows to steer around the devastating welcome sprang more than anything from his having been caught off guard still it was more than i could take i was at once sad furious vexed and helpless at the time i could not even measure the impact on our way home to eastern france we stopped in paris for a few days just to show my friend from weston the city of light but my inexorable grumpiness made everyone eager to hit the road again i ruined paris for all of us i was a mess the coming months were bitter and awkward i didn8217t want anyone to see me but everyone wanted to greet l8217am233ricaine my mother understood right away not only how and why i had gained the weight but also how i felt she treaded lightly avoiding the unavoidable topic perhaps particularly because i had soon given her something more dire to worry about having seen a bit of the world i had lost my taste for attending the local university i now wanted to study languages in a grande 201cole like an ivy league school in paris and on top of that to take a literary track at the sorbonne at the same time it was unusual and really an insane workload my parents were not at all keen on the idea of paris if i got in hardly a given as the competition is legendary it was going to be a big emotional and financial sacrifice to have me three and a half hours from home so i had to campaign hard but thanks in part to the obvious persistence of my raw nerves in the end they let me go back to paris for the famously grueling entrance exam i passed and in late september i moved to paris my parents always wanted the best for me by all saints8217 day november 1 i had gained another five pounds and by christmas five more still at five feet three i was now overweight by any standard and nothing i owned fit not even my american mother8217s summer shift i had two flannel ones8212same design but roomier8212made to cover up my lumpiness i told the dressmaker to hurry and hated myself every minute of the day more and more my father8217s faux pas at le havre seemed justified those were blurry days of crying myself to sleep and zipping past all mirrors it may not seem so strange an experience for a nineteenyearold but none of my french girlfriends was going through it then something of a yuletide miracle occurred or perhaps i should say dr miracle who showed up thanks to my mamie over the long holiday break she asked the family physician dr meyer to pay a call she did this most discreetly careful not to bruise me further dr meyer had watched me grow up and he was the kindest gentleman on earth he assured me that getting back in shape would be really easy and just a matter of a few 8220old french tricks8221 by easter he promised i8217d be almost back to my old self and certainly by the end of the school year in june i8217d be ready to wear my old bathing suit the one i8217d packed for america as in a fairy tale it was going to be our secret no use boring anyone else with the particulars of our plan he said and the weight would go away much faster than it came sounded great to me of course i wanted to put my faith in dr meyer and fortunately there didn8217t seem to be many options at the time dr miracle8217s weekend prescription for the next three weeks i was to keep a diary of everything i ate this is a strategy that will sound familiar from some american diet programs such as weight watchers i was to record not only what and how much but also when and where there was no calorie counting not that i could have done that the stated purpose was simply for him to gauge the nutritional value of what i was eating it was the first time i ever heard the word since nothing more was asked of me i was only too happy to comply this is the first thing you should do too dr meyer demanded no great precision in measurement just estimate he said stipulating 8220a portion8221 as the only unit of quantity and roughly equal to a mediumsize apple in america where the greatest enemy of balanced eating is ever bigger portions i suggest a little more precision here8217s where the small kitchen scale comes in bread which sometimes comes in huge slices here might be more easily weighed than compared with an apple which seems bigger here too three weeks later i was home again for the weekend just before noon dr miracle distingu233 gray templed made his second house call he also stayed for lunch afterward reviewing my diary he immediately identified a pattern utterly obvious to him but hiding somehow from me as i blithely recorded every crumb i put in my mouth on the walk between school and the room i was renting in the seventh arrondissement there were no fewer than sixteen pastry shops without my having much noticed my meals were more and more revolving around pastry as i was living in paris my family could not know this so when i came home my mother naturally prepared my favorites unaware i was eating extra desserts on the sly even under her roof my parisian pastry gluttony was wonderfully diverse in the morning there was croissant or pain au chocolat or chouquette or tarte au sucre lunch was preceded by a stop at po238lane the famous breadmaker8217s shop where i could not resist the pain aux raisins or tarte aux pommes apple tart or petits sabl233s next stop was at a caf233 for the ubiquitous jambonbeurre ham on a buttered baguette and what remained of the po238lane pastry with coffee dinner always included and sometimes simply was an 233clair paris brest religieuse or millefeuille curiously called a napoleon outside france always some form of creamy buttery sweetness sometimes i would even stop off for a palmier a big puff pastry sugarcovered cookie for my go251ter afternoon snack as a student i was living off things i could eat on the go hardly any greens were passing my lips and my daily serving of fruit was coming from fruit tarts i was eating this strangely lopsided fare without the slightest thought and with utter contentment8212except of course for how i looked now this was obviously not a diet i had picked up in america where one could hardly say the streets are lined with irresistible patisseries though then as now there was no shortage of tempting hot chocolatechip cookie stands and sellers of rich ice cream to say nothing of a mindboggling variety of supermarket sweets made with things infinitely worse for you than cream and butter but as i was to learn it was my adoptive american way of eating that had gone to my head and opened me up to the dangers of this delicious parisian minefield for in america i had gotten into some habits eating standing up not making my own food living off whatever n8217importe quoi as the french say as other kids were doing brownies and bagels were particular hazards we had nothing quite like them at home so who could tell how rich they were
