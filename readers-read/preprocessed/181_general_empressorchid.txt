 my imperial life began with a smell a rotten smell that came from my fathers coffinhe had been dead for two months and we were still carrying him trying to reach peking his birthplace for burial my mother was frustrated my husband was the governor of wuhu she said to the footmen whom we had hired to bear the coffin yes madam the head footman answered humbly and we sincerely wish the governor a good journey home in my memory my father was not a happy man he had been repeatedly demoted because of his poor performance in the suppression of the taiping peasant uprisings not until later did i learn that my father was not totally to blame for years china had been dogged by famine and foreign aggression anyone who tried on my fathers shoes would understand that carrying out the emperors order to restore peace in the countryside was impossiblepeasants saw their lives as no better than death i witnessed my fathers struggles and sufferings at a young age i was born and raised in anhwei the poorest province in china we didnt live in poverty but i was aware that my neighbors had eaten earthworms for dinner and had sold their children to pay off debts my fathers slow journey to hell and my mothers effort to fight it occupied my childhood like a long armed cricket my mother tried to block a carriage from running over her family the summer heat baked the path the coffin was carried in a tilted position because the footmen were of different heights mother imagined how uncomfortable my father must be lying inside we walked in silence and listened to the sound of our broken shoes tapping the dirt swarms of flies chased the coffin each time the footmen paused for a break the flies covered the lid like a blanket mother asked my sister rong my brother kuei hsiang and me to keep the flies away but we were too exhausted to lift our arms we had been traveling north along the grand canal on foot because we had no money to hire a boat my feet were covered with blisters the landscape on both sides of the path was bleak the water in the canal was low and dirt brown beyond it were barren hills which extended mile after mile there were fewer inns to be seen the ones that we did come upon were infested with lice youd better pay us the head footman said to mother when he heard her complaint that her wallet was near empty or you will have to carry the coffin yourselves madam mother began to sob again and said that her husband didnt deserve this she gained no sympathy the next dawn the footmen abandoned the coffin mother sat down on a rock by the road she had a ring of sores sprouting around her mouth rong and kuei hsiang discussed burying our father where he was i didnt have the heart to leave him in a place without a tree in sight although i was not my fathers favorite at first he was disappointed that i his firstborn was not a sonhe did his best in raising me it was he who insisted that i learn to read i had no formal schooling but i developed enough of a vocabulary to figure out the stories of the ming and ching classics at the age of five i thought that being born in the year of the sheep was bad luck i told my father that my friends in the village said that my birth sign was an inauspicious one it meant that i would be slaughtered father disagreed the sheep is a most adorable creature he said it is a symbol of modesty harmony and devotion he explained that my birth sign was in fact strong you have a double ten in the numbers you were born on the tenth day of the tenth moon which fell on the twentyninth of november 1835 you cant be luckier also having doubts regarding my being a sheep mother brought in a local astrologer to consult the astrologer believed that double ten was too strong too full the old hag said which meant too easily spilled your daughter will grow up to be a stubborn sheep which means a miserable end the astrologer talked excitedly as white spittle gathered at the corners of her mouth even an emperor would avoid ten in fear of its fullness finally at the suggestion of the astrologer my parents gave me a name that promised i would bend this was how i was called orchid mother told me later that orchids had also been the favorite subject of my fathers ink paintings he liked the fact that the plant stood green in all seasons and its flower was elegant in color graceful in form and sweet in scent my fathers name was hui cheng yehonala when i close my eyes i can see my old man standing in a gray cotton gown he was slender with confucian features it is hard to imagine from his gentle look that his yehonala ancestors were manchu bannermen who lived on horseback father told me that they were originally from the nu cheng people in the state of manchuria in northern china between mongolia and korea the name yehonala meant that our roots could be traced to the yeho tribe of the nala clan in the sixteenth century my ancestors fought shoulder to shoulder with the bannerman leader nurhachi who conquered china in 1644 and became the first emperor of the ching dynasty the ching had now entered its seventh generation my father inherited the title of manchu bannerman of the blue rank although the title gave him little but honor when i was ten years old my father became the taotai or governor of a small town called wuhu in anhwei province i have fond memories of that time although many consider wuhu a terrible place during the summer months the temperature stayed above one hundred degrees day and night other governors hired coolies to fan their children but my parents couldnt afford one each morning my sheet would be soaked with sweat you wet the bed my brother would tease nevertheless i loved wuhu as a child the lake there was part of the great yangtze river which drove through china carving out gorges shaggy crags and valleys thick with ferns and grasses it descended into a bright broad richly watered plain where vegetables rice and mosquitoes all thrived it flowed on until it met the east china sea at shanghai wuhu meant the lake of a luxuriant growth of weeds our house the governors mansion had a gray ceramictile roof with the figures of gods standing at the four corners of the tilted eaves every morning i would walk to the lake to wash my face and brush my hair my reflection in the water was mirrorclear we drank from and bathed in the river i played with my siblings and neighbors on the slick backs of buffalo we did fishandfrog jumps the long bushy weeds were our favorite hiding places we snacked on the hearts of sweet water plants called chiaopai in the afternoon when the heat became unbearable i would organize the children to help cool the house my sister and brother would fill buckets and i would pull them up to the roof where i poured the water over the tiles we would go back to the water afterward pieh bamboo rafts floated by they came down the river like a giant loose necklace my friends and i would hop onto the rafts for rides we joined the raft men singing songs my favorite tune was wuhu is a wonderful place at sunset mother would call us home dinner was set on a table in the yard under a trellis covered with purple wisteria my mother was raised the chinese way although she was a manchu by blood according to mother after the manchus conquered china they discovered that the chinese system of ruling was more benevolent and efficient and they adopted it fully the manchu emperors learned to speak mandarin emperor tao kuang ate with chopsticks he was an admirer of peking opera and he hired chinese tutors to teach his children the manchus also adopted the chinese way of dressing the only thing that stayed manchu was the hairstyle the emperor had a shaved forehead and a rope like braid of black hair down his back called a queue the empress wore her hair with a thin black board fastened on top of her head displaying ornaments my grandparents on my mothers side were brought up in the chan or zen religion a combination of buddhism and taoism my mother was taught the chan concept of happiness which was to find satisfaction in small things i was taught to appreciate the fresh air in the morning the color of leaves turning red in autumn and the waters smoothness when i soaked my hands in the basin my mother didnt consider herself educated but she adored li po a tang dynasty poet each time she read his poems she would discover new meanings she would put down her book and gaze out the window her gooseeggshaped face was stunningly beautiful mandarin chinese was the language i spoke as a child once a month we had a tutor who came to teach us manchu i remember nothing about the classes but being bored i wouldnt have sat through the lessons if it hadnt been to please my parents deep down i knew that my parents were not serious about having us master the manchu language it was only for the appearance so my mother could say to her guests oh my children are taking manchu the truth was that manchu was not useful it was like a dead river that nobody drank from i was crazy about peking operas again it was my mothers influence she was such an enthusiast that she saved for the entire year so she could hire a local troupe for an inhouse performance during the chinese new year each year the troupe presented a different operamy mother invited all the neighbors and their children to join us when i turned twelve the troupe performed hua mulan i fell in love with the woman warrior hua mulan after the show i went to the back of our makeshift stage and emptied my wallet to tip the actress who let me try on her costume she even taught me the aria goodbye my dress for the rest of the month people as far as a mile from the lake could hear me singing goodbye my dress my father took pleasure in telling the background to the operas he loved to show off his knowledge he reminded us that we were manchus the ruling class of china it is the manchus who appreciate and promote chinese art and culture when liquor took hold of my fathers spirit he would become more animated he would line up the children and quiz us on the details of the ancient bannerman system he wouldnt quit until every child knew how each bannerman was identified by his rank such as bordered plain white yellow red and blue one day my father brought out a scroll map of china china was like the crown of a hat ringed by countries eager and accustomed to pledging their fealty to the son of heaven the emperor among the countries were laos siam and burma to the south nepal to the west korea the ryukyu islands and sulu to the east and southeast mongolia and turkestan to the north and northwest years later when i recalled the scene i understood why my father showed us the map the shape of china was soon to change by the time my father met his fate during the last few years of emperor tao kuang the peasant revolts had worsened in the midst of a summer drought my father didnt come home for months my mother worried about his safety for she had heard news from a neighboring province about angry peasants setting their governors mansion on fire my father had been living in his office and trying to control the rebels one day an edict arrived to everyones shock the emperor dismissed him father came home deeply shamed he shut himself in the study and refused visitors within a year his health broke down it didnt take him long to die our doctor bills piled up even after his death my mother sold all of the family possessions but we still couldnt clear the debts yesterday mother sold her last item her wedding souvenir from my father a butterfly hairpin made of green jade before leaving us the footmen carried the coffin to the bank of the grand canal so we could see the passing boats where we might get help the heat worsened and the air grew still the smell of decay from the coffin grew stronger we spent the night under the open sky tormented by the heat and mosquitoes my siblings and i could hear one anothers stomachs rumbling i woke at dawn and heard the clattering of a horses hooves in the distance i thought i was dreaming in no time a rider appeared in front of me i felt dizzy with fatigue and hunger the man dismounted and walked straight toward me without saying a word he presented me with a package tied with ribbon he said it was from the taotai of the local town startled i ran to my mother who opened the package inside were three hundred taels of silver the taotai must be a friend of your fathers mother cried with the help of the rider we hired back our footmen but our good luck didnt last a few miles down the canal we were stopped by a group of men on horses led by the taotai himself a mistake has been made he said my rider delivered the taels to the wrong family hearing this mother fell to her knees the taotais men took back the taels exhaustion suddenly overwhelmed me and i fell on my fathers coffin the taotai walked to the coffin and squatted as if studying the grains of the wood he was a stocky man with rough features a moment later he turned to me i expected him to speak but he didnt you are not a chinese are you he finally asked his eyes were on my unbound feet no sir i replied i am manchu how old are you fifteen seventeen he nodded his eyes continued to travel up and down examining me the road is filled with bandits he said a pretty girl like you should not be walking but my father needs to go home my tears ran the taotai took my hand and placed the silver taels in my palm my respects to your father i never forgot about the taotai after i became the empress of china i sought him out i made an exception to promote him i made him a provincial governor and he was given a handsome pension for the rest of his life
