 the shadow of a crow at the first gesture of morning flies began stirring inmans eyes and the long wound at his neck drew them and the sound of their wings and the touch of their feet were soon more potent than a yardful of roosters in rousing a man to wake so he came to yet one more day in the hospital ward he flapped the flies away with his hands and looked across the foot of his bed to an open triplehung window ordinarily he could see to the red road and the oak tree and the low brick wall and beyond them to a sweep of fields and flat piney woods that stretched to the western horizon the view was a long one for the flatlands the hospital having been built on the only swell within eyeshot but it was too early yet for a vista the window might as well have been painted grey had it not been too dim inman would have read to pass the time until breakfast for the book he was reading had the effect of settling his mind but he had burned up the last of his own candles reading to bring sleep the night before and lamp oil was too scarce to be striking the hospitals lights for mere diversion so he rose and dressed and sat in a ladderback chair putting the gloomy room of beds and their broken occupants behind him he flapped again at the flies and looked out the window at the first smear of foggy dawn and waited for the world to begin shaping up outside the window was tall as a door and he had imagined many times that it would open onto some other place and let him walk through and be there during his first weeks in the hospital he had been hardly able to move his head and all that kept his mind occupied had been watching out the window and picturing the old green places he recollected from home childhood places the damp creek bank where indian pipes grew the corner of a meadow favored by brownandblack caterpillars in the fall a hickory limb that overhung the lane and from which he often watched his father driving cows down to the barn at dusk they would pass underneath him and then he would close his eyes and listen as the cupping sound of their hooves in the dirt grew fainter and fainter until it vanished into the calls of katydids and peepers the window apparently wanted only to take his thoughts back which was fine with him for he had seen the metal face of the age and had been so stunned by it that when he thought into the future all he could vision was a world from which everything he counted important had been banished or had willingly fled by now he had stared at the window all through a late summer so hot and wet that the air both day and night felt like breathing through a dishrag so damp it caused fresh sheets to sour under him and tiny black mushrooms to grow overnight from the limp pages of the book on his bedside table inman suspected that after such long examination the grey window had finally said about all it had to say that morning though it surprised him for it brought to mind a lost memory of sitting in school a similar tall window beside him framing a scene of pastures and low green ridges terracing up to the vast hump of cold mountain it was september the hayfield beyond the beaten dirt of the school playground stood pantwaist high and the heads of grasses were turning yellow from need of cutting the teacher was a round little man hairless and pink of face he owned but one rusty black suit of clothes and a pair of old overlarge dress boots that curled up at the toes and were so worn down that the heels were wedgelike he stood at the front of the room rocking on the points he talked at length through the morning about history teaching the older students of grand wars fought in ancient england after a time of actively not listening the young inman had taken his hat from under the desk and held it by its brim he flipped his wrist and the hat skimmed out the window and caught an updraft and soared it landed far out across the playground at the edge of the hayfield and rested there black as the shadow of a crow squatted on the ground the teacher saw what inman had done and told him to go get it and to come back and take his whipping the man had a big paddleboard with holes augered in it and he liked to use it inman never did know what seized him at that moment but he stepped out the door and set the hat on his head at a dapper rake and walked away never to return the memory passed on as the light from the window rose toward day the man in the bed next to inmans sat and drew his crutches to him as he did every morning the man went to the window and spit repeatedly and with great effort until his clogged lungs were clear he ran a comb through his black hair which hung lank below his jaw and was cut square around he tucked the long front pieces of hair behind his ears and put on his spectacles of smoked glass which he wore even in the dim of morning his eyes apparently too weak for the warmest form of light then still in his nightshirt he went to his table and began working at a pile of papers he seldom spoke more than a word or two at a time and inman had learned little more of him than that his name was balis and that before the war he had been to school at chapel hill where he had attempted to master greek all his waking time was now spent trying to render ancient scribble from a fat little book into plain writing anyone could read he sat hunched at his table with his face inches from his work and squirmed in his chair looking to find a comfortable position for his leg his right foot had been taken off by grape at cold harbor and the stub seemed not to want to heal and had rotted inch by inch from the ankle up his amputations had now proceeded past the knee and he smelled all the time like last years ham for a while there was only the sound of baliss pen scratching pages turning then others in the room began to stir and cough a few to moan eventually the light swelled so that all the lines of the varnished beadboard walls stood clear and inman could cock back on the chairs hind legs and count the flies on the ceiling he made it to be sixtythree as inmans view through the window solidified the dark trunks of the oak trees showed themselves first then the patchy lawn and finally the red road he was waiting for the blind man to come he had attended to the mans movements for some weeks and now that he had healed enough to be numbered among the walking inman was determined to go out to the cart and speak to the man for inman figured him to have been living with a wound for a long time inman had taken his own during the fighting outside petersburg when his two nearest companions pulled away his clothes and looked at his neck they had said him a solemn farewell in expectation of his death well meet again in a better world they said but he lived as far as the field hospital and there the doctors had taken a similar attitude he was classed among the dying and put aside on a cot to do so but he failed at it after two days space being short they sent him on to a regular hospital in his own state all through the mess of the field hospital and the long grim train ride south in a boxcar filled with wounded he had agreed with his friends and the doctors he thought he would die about all he could remember of the trip was the heat and the odors of blood and of shit for many of the wounded had the flux those with the strength to do so had knocked holes in the sides of the wood boxcars with the butts of rifles and rode with their heads thrust out like crated poultry to catch the breeze at the hospital the doctors looked at him and said there was not much they could do he might live or he might not they gave him but a grey rag and a little basin to clean his own wound those first few days when he broke consciousness enough to do it he wiped at his neck with the rag until the water in the basin was the color of the comb on a turkeycock but mainly the wound had wanted to clean itself before it started scabbing it spit out a number of things a collar button and a piece of wool collar from the shirt he had been wearing when he was hit a shard of soft grey metal as big as a quarter dollar piece and unaccountably something that closely resembled a peach pit that last he set on the nightstand and studied for some days he could never settle his mind on whether it was a part of him or not he finally threw it out the window but then had troubling dreams that it had taken root and grown like jacks bean into something monstrous his neck had eventually decided to heal but during the weeks when he could neither turn his head nor hold up a book to read inman had lain every day watching the blind man the man would arrive alone shortly after dawn pushing his cart up the road doing it about as well as any man who could see he would set up his business under an oak tree across the road lighting a fire in a ring of stones and boiling peanuts over it in an iron pot he would sit all day on a stool with his back to the brick wall selling peanuts and newspapers to those at the hospital whole enough to walk unless someone came to buy something he rested as still as a stuffed man with his hands together in his lap that summer inman had viewed the world as if it were a picture framed by the molding around the window long stretches of time often passed when for all the change in the scene it might as well have been an old painting of a road a wall a tree a cart a blind man inman had sometimes counted off slow numbers in his head to see how long it would be before anything of significance altered it was a game and he had rules for it a bird flying by did not count someone walking down the road did major weather changes didthe sun coming out fresh rainbut shadows of passing clouds did not some days hed get up in the thousands before there was any allowable alteration in the elements of the picture he believed the scene would never leave his mindwall blind man tree cart roadno matter how far on he lived he imagined himself an old man thinking about it those pieces together seemed to offer some meaning though he did not know what and suspected he never would inman watched the window as he ate his breakfast of boiled oats and butter and shortly he saw the blind man come trudging up the road his back humped against the weight of the cart he pushed little twin clouds of dust rising from beneath the turning cartwheels when the blind man had his fire going and his peanuts boiling inman put his plate on the windowsill and went outside and with the shuffling step of an old man crossed the lawn to the road the blind man was square and solid in shoulder and hip and his britches were cinched at the waist with a great leather belt wide as a razor strop he went hatless even in the heat and his cropped hair was thick and grey coarsetextured as the bristles to a hemp brush he sat with his head tipped down and appeared to be somewhat in a muse but he raised up as inman approached like he was really looking his eyelids though were dead as shoe leather and were sunken into puckered cups where his eyeballs had been without pausing even for salutation inman said who put out your pair of eyes the blind man had a friendly smile on his face and he said nobody i never had any that took inman aback for his imagination had worked in the belief that they had been plucked out in some desperate and bloody dispute some brute fraction every vile deed he had witnessed lately had been at the hand of a human agent so he had about forgot that there was a whole other order of misfortune why did you never have any inman said just happened that way well inman said youre mighty calm especially for a man that most would say has taken the little end of the horn all his life the blind man said it might have been worse had i ever been given a glimpse of the world and then lost it maybe inman said though what would you pay right now to have your eyeballs back for ten minutes plenty i bet the man studied on the question he worked his tongue around the corner of his mouth he said id not give an indianhead cent i fear it might turn me hateful its done it to me inman said theres plenty i wish id never seen thats not the way i meant it you said ten minutes its having a thing and the loss im talking about the blind man twisted a square of newsprint up into a cone and then dipped with a riddly spoon into the pot and filled the cone with wet peanuts he handed it to inman and said come on cite me one instance where you wished you were blind where to begin inman wondered malvern hill sharpsburg petersburg any would do admirably as example of unwelcome visions but fredericksburg was a day particularly lodged in his mind so he sat with his back to the oak and halved the wet peanut shells and thumbed the meats out into his mouth and told the blind man his tale beginning with how the fog had lifted that morning to reveal a vast army marching uphill toward a stone wall a sunken road inmans regiment was called to join the men already behind the wall and they had quickly formed up alongside the big white house at the top of maryes heights lee and longstreet and befeathered stuart stood right there on the lawn before the porch taking turns glassing the far side of the river and talking longstreet had a grey shawl of wool draped about his shoulders compared to the other two men longstreet looked like a stout hog drover but from what inman had seen of lees way of thinking hed any day rather have longstreet backing him in a fight dull as longstreet looked he had a mind that constantly sought ground configured so a man could hunker down and do a world of killing from a position of relative safety and that day at fredericksburg was all in the form of fighting that lee mistrusted and that longstreet welcomed
