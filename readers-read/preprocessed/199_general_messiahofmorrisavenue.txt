 prologue fort oswald texas an early summer storm roils the sky lightning crackles between fat thunderheads they lurch over the flat plain rolypoly gunmetalgrey giants thousands of feet tall occasionally spitting thin streams of dazzling light at the ground abutting the vast air bases southern boundary is a brandnew maximum security prison one of thousands that dot the lone star landscape as familiar a sight as forests of oil rigs once were back in the bad old days before god returned to america the prison is a sprawling complex covering dozens of acres it consists of identical rectangular compounds each formed by three rows of titaniumreinforced 20foot chainlink fence topped with dense rolls of razor wire the gap between each row is packed with more razor wire the wire bristles with countless thousands of tiny blades when lightning flashes overhead they flash too the prisons full name is the risen lamb correctional facility its directors call it a christian prison one that respects the retributive power of church and state the right of the judiciary to exact punishment the right of the lord to vengeance the men and women incarcerated here arent inmates or prisoners but sinners those convicted of capital crimes are called cardinal sinners but the god of vengeance is also the god of forgiveness this prison differs from all others in the fervent efforts that are made to help cardinal sinners repent before theyre terminated to be born again before they die at the center of the complex is its spiritual heart a circular twostory rotunda containing ten lethalinjection chambers no other facility in the world has such multiple capability if necessary ten cardinal sinners can be terminated simultaneously from the center of the rotunda rises a colossal 150foot rotating crucifix one full rotation every 60 seconds front and back the arms of the cross bear a scrolling led readout on one side the legend reads christ died for your sins when the opposite side comes around it reads now its your turn its been an auspicious morning for the new facility at noon it executed its very first cardinal sinner a young noncaucasian male and for an unusual crime treason every effort was made to bring him to the lord before he went to the execution chamber alas he was unrepentant owing to the inexperience of the staff he underwent considerable trauma the lethal drugs took some time to effectuate termination but all is well at 1245 pm he was declared dead and his remains were cremated the ashes will be placed in a simple container and before nightfall delivered to his mother the years havent softened the image of him lying dead on the gurney the memory is as raw as the long bloody gashes the ivs had opened in his arms each time i see him there the pain still roils me as the storm did the sky i put him on that gurney i was his judas one in the beginning i knew him only as the mysterious stranger i first came across him at a low point in my career8212well the low point actually8212lower as they say in texas than a snakes belly clinging to the underside of said reptile was where youd find me johnny greco in the middle of the second decade of americas millennium or christs millennium8212which by then were interchangeable terms i was entering if not the twilight certainly the happy hour of a long career which had begun in youthful idealism at the columbia school of journalism and proceeded more realistically through the ranks of the newspaper of record reaching its peak when i was fortysomething and the descendants of mr joseph pulitzer bestowed one of their baubles on me for investigative reportage this was when that still meant something before they began awarding pulitzers for indepth gossip and best rumor from then on my path led downhill to its current nadir a senior post at something called the new jersey inquiring mind according to its proprietors the inquiring mind was a newspaper but it had no connection to news or to paper at a time when most real newspapers had gone out of business the term had the cachet of the obsolete the inquiring mind was a newspaper in the same sense that when i was a kid a pimpmobile was called a brougham the homepage was topped with tasteful lineart depicting a crusader on whose shield was emblazoned the proud word truth below this logo it was a bottomfeeding webzine pumping out oldfashioned streaming video and chockablock with blinding ads for sex aids bankruptcy lawyers homeopathic cancer cures intercontinental dating services and astrologybased investment strategies there was an identical inquiring mind in every other state of the union and in scores of nominally englishspeaking countries the whole worldwide webnet of rockbottom sleaze cost almost nothing to run and made a fortune it was owned by three guys in bangalore alas they didnt call themselves three guys from bangalore if only they called themselves newsweb and were listed on the nikkei multibourse one of them is now prime minister of india the inquiring mind was premised on an obvious if depressing reality whatever global computer literacy was doing for understanding among nations it had added hundreds of millions of people to the happy throng of those willing to do anything in front of a camera now everyone in the world had the chance to act like a fubar senior on spring break whether it was a sherpa trying to rollerblade down stage 2 of everest or an ordinary joe from canton ohio with size 14 feet so webbed that from the butt down he looked like donald duck the freaks of planet earth found a warm welcome at the inquiring mind like all the others the new jersey edition was essentially a stripmining mechanism that scoured our territory for freaks the only remotely newspaperlike aspect was my halfdozen stringers around the garden state doing the scouring if they found something promising they forwarded their video to me if i liked it i would report it that is insert myself in the video thanks to some miracle of digital editing beyond my printbred brain and slug it into the appropriate department it could run regionally or nationally or8212that pinnacle of journalistic prowess8212globally the toprated department was the nut log which brought our reportorial scrutiny to bear upon rampant cases of mental derangement it wasnt exploitative or anything8212perish the thought many nut log candidates were religious nuts which wasnt surprising given the improvements christian fundamentalists had introduced into the american way of life the ten commandments now appeared helpfully in schools bars planes restrooms gyms and nightclubs on cigarettes alcohol prescription drugs lingerie advertising8212anywhere temptation might slither up and bite your ankle this theocratic concern for american souls was widely seen as a good thing in a national inquiring mind instapoll wed run 86 of the respondees believed theocracy was spelled the ocracy 899 of them said they didnt know what ocracy was but knew it was good the most powerful effect of the ocracy on the deranged was its constant drumbeat that these were the final days for someone with a limited supply of marbles the urgency of the endtime message had a very specific result instead of developing some more normal abnormality like barking from trees or directing traffic in their boxers they zeroed in on being god8212or close to it my favorite nut log nut was a former professor of archeology at rutgers an obliging angel of the lord had informed him that he was the reincarnation of simon stylites a saint whod spent the best years of his life atop a fiftyfoot pole sustained by bread and water st simon the sequel had constructed a similar perch in his yard in asbury park and had been living up it in a loincloth for a while when the nut log crew caught up with him his wife would shin up a ladder every morning to bring the saint his bread and water we shot this ritual from a neighboring tree and the very first time st simon snarled damn you woman i said stale bread and this water is clean that did it for me but what sold him to the nut log was an hour later when the time came for his selfmortification the appearance of his helpmeet had given him a fine erection which he proceeded to pound with a mallet against the floor of the platform for a good half hour then there were the messiahs in theory messiahs were a goldmine problem was they were largely indistinguishable the manson eyes the unkempt hair the beard with bits of food in it the occasional robe8212theyd all been watching the same movie when you get right down to it fanatics arent that funny except for the king james garble coming at you nonstop most christs could just as easily be animal activists roswell geeks classical bassoonists or wine writers so when i first got a report from my stringer in south jersey about some guy wandering around with a bunch of disciples performing miracles i didnt pay much attention messiahs were a dry hole but other stringers in other parts of the state began to hear things on their grapevines a man cured of tb in a supermarket parking lot in phillipsburg a kid with ms made to walk in a schoolyard in mount laurel more than one report of a young woman cured of fullblown aids no location given i began to wonder a little not whether miracles were happening quite the opposite these miracles had a familiar ring they sounded like retooled versions of old tentrevival layingonofhands scams autosuggestion temporarily alleviating symptoms of serious disease you had to know your way around not to be fooled by them but desperately sick people often were then theyd find out thered been no cure and fall apart hardly what nut log fans wanted to see on their carputers in morning traffic messiahs fell into two categories nuts or hustlers this guy sounded like the second and i wasnt about to give him any publicity he was probably doing enough harm as it was on the other hand he didnt seem to want publicity which was puzzling nuts or hustlers messiahs were always ravenous for attention even the most severely unhinged sought us out day and night one of my stringers a funny energetic asian kid named kuni was intrigued enough to start keeping a record of the miracle messiah there werent that many sightings perhaps five in as many months all were after the fact there was no way to predict where he was going to crop up he seemed to be operating in the tristate area but was hard to track because he moved in the underground of the truly poor the toughest neighborhoods of hardhit cities like elizabeth trenton bridgeport once or twice a stringer got wind that hed materialized somewhere but the neighborhoods where he appeared werent easy or safe to navigate and by the time someone got there he was on his way again leaving behind talk of cures and second sight and people changed by his words the inaccessibility of these places made it hard for stringers to find and check the people whod been cured or changed by his words kuni kept at it one source said the miracle workers people called him jay and they all traveled together in a beatup van he sometimes preached in spanish he never took up collections as other messiahs invariably did one source said he had a real slow way of talking that made you feel peacefullike kuni said someone told him she thought hed got his start in camden thatd be news i said getting your start in camden i remember this conversation because it was the first time kuni called him the mysterious stranger i liked that it was a very cool putdown from then on in that way that happens when someone anonymous acquires a handle he became more real i asked kuni about him regularly not because i planned to run a story but just so i could say whats new with the mysterious stranger it always made me smile it wasnt a nice smile the term mysterious stranger had a derogatory derisive overtone it could even be code indicating to those who moved in the antifundamentalist samizdat that you did too you too resisted the dictatorship of holytariat worked for the overthrow of the churchstate the term was in vogue that year thanks to a man im proud to say i loathed one of the few men in terminally compromised culturally homeless morally destitute america who was evil enough to make the stump of my lefty conscience tingle the reverend james zebediah sabbath embodied in every respect christian americas long journey from the heathen wilderness of the midtwentieth century into the promised land of the early twentyfirst a faithbased moralityvaluing biblebelieving america where theocracy and democracy were synonymous where executive legislature and judiciary were father son and holy spirit distinct omnipotent8212not to mention omniscient8212persons of the ruling triune god the reverend had been spiritual adviser to three presidents enjoyed the rank of twostar general as chaplaininchief of the us armed forces and had twice been reappointed spiritual clerk of what he first dubbed the supreme court under god he was arguably one of the most powerful men in the nation8212certainly the ceo of fundamentalist christianity which by the second decade of christs millennium was the only kind left standing our paths had crossed twice once face8211to8211face8212for me disastrously8212and once electronically earlier that year when the reverend had achieved a decisive victory in a war hed fought for decades the conversion of that last nest of paganism in gods chosen land hollywood hollywood had fought back hollywood had thrown everything it had at him but finally to use his favorite phrase hollywood had cried uncle after a furious internal debate and scores of angry resignations the academy of motion picture arts and sciences had invited the reverend to host the first faithbased academy awards in history
