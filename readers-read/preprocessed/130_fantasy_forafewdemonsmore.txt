 hammering my fist against the back of my closet wasnt one of my more pleasant dreams actually it hurt the pain broke through my comfortable sleepy haze and i felt the primitive part of me that never slept coolly measuring my slow gathering of will as i tried to wake up with an eerie feeling of disconnection i watched it happen even as in my dream i tore the clothes off the rod and threw them to my rumpled bed something though wasnt right i wasnt waking up the dream wasnt passively shredding into hardtoremember bits and with a jolt i realized i was conscious but not awake what in hell something was really really wrong and instinct sent a pulse of adrenaline thorough me demanding i wake but i didnt my breath was quick and ragged and after i emptied the closet i dropped to the floor and tapped my knuckles on the boards for a secret compartment i knew wasnt there frightened i grasped my will and forced myself awake pain reverberated through my forehead i sprawled all my muscles going flaccid i managed to turn my head and my ear stung instead of my nose breaking hard wood pressed against me cold through my pajama shorts and top my cry came out as a gurgle i couldnt breathe something something was in here with me in my head trying to possess me terror smothered me like a blanket i couldnt see it couldnt hear it could hardly sense it but my body had become a battlefield8212one where i didnt know how to win possession was a black art and i hadnt taken the right classes damn it my life isnt supposed to be like this utter panic gave me strength i tried to mobilize my legs and arms under me and push i managed to rise to my hands and knees then fell into my bedside table it crashed to the floor and rolled to the empty closet my pulse hammering the fear of suffocating overtook me i managed to stagger into the hallway looking for help my unknown assailant and i found common ground and working together we took a breath that escaped in a choked cry where the devil was ivy was she deaf maybe she hadnt yet come in from her run with jenks shed said theyd be late as if bothered by the cooperation my attacker gripped harder and i collapsed to the floor my eyes were open and the red sheet of my hair stood between me and the end of the dusky hallway it had won whatever it was it had won and i panicked as i found myself sitting up with an eerie slowness the thick scent of burnt amber hung in my nose rising from my skin no i cried in my thoughts8212but i couldnt even speak i wanted to scream but my possessor made me take a slow sedate breath instead malum i heard myself curse my voice carrying an odd accent and a sophisticated lilt that had never been mine that was the last penny in the jar fear shifted to anger i didnt know who was in here with me but whoever it was was going to get out right now making me speak in tongues was just rude falling into my thoughts i felt the barest brush of someone elses confusion fine i could build on that before the intruder could figure out what i was doing i tapped the ley line out back in the graveyard stark foreign surprise filled me and while my assailant struggled to break me from the line i formed a protection circle in my thoughts practice makes perfect i thought smugly then braced myself this was going to hurt like hell i opened my thoughts to the ley line with an abandon id never dared before and it came magic roared in it overflowed my chi and poured into my body burning my synapses and neurons tulpa i thought in agony the word opening the mental channels to spindle the energy the rush would have killed me if i hadnt already burned a trail of nerves from my chi to my mind groaning i felt the power sear anew as it raced to the protection circle in my thoughts expanding it like a balloon it was how i spindled ley line energy to use later but at this rate it was like diving into a vat of molten metal an internal yelp of pain resounded in me and with a mental push that i mirrored with my hands i shoved away from myself a snap reverberated through me and i was free of the unknown presence from the churchs belfry above came the sound of the bell tolling8212an echo of my actions something rolled and bumped down the corridor to crash into the wall at the end of the hall i gasped and pulled my head up then groaned in pain moving hurt i held too much ley line power it felt as if it had settled in my muscles and using them squeezed the energy out ow i panted very aware that something at the end of the hall was standing up but at least now it wasnt in my head my heart beat and that hurt too oh god id never held this much power before and i stank i reeked of burnt amber what the turn was going on with a pained determination i squeezed the protection circle in my mind until the energy slipped back through my chi and into the ley line it hurt almost as much as taking it in but when i unspindled the everafter from my thoughts to leave only that which my chi could hold i looked up past the snarls of my hair panting oh god it was newt what are you doing here i said feeling coated in everafter slime the powerful demon looked confused but i was still too out of things to appreciate its shocked expression either a smoothfaced adolescent boy or a strongfeatured female slender of build it stood barefoot in my hallway between the kitchen and the living room squinting i looked again8212yeah the demon was standing this time not floating its long bony feet definitely pressing the floorboards8212and i wondered how newt had managed to attack me when i was on hallowed ground the addition to the church where it stood now wasnt sanctified though and it looked bewildered wearing a dark red robe that looked somewhere between a kimono and what lawrence of arabia might wear on his day off there was a soft blurring of black ley line energy and a slender obsidian staff as tall as i was melted into existence in newts grasp completing the vision i remembered from the time i had been trapped in the everafter and had had to buy a trip home from newt the demons eyes were entirely black8212even what should be the whites8212but they were more alive than any id ever seen as they stared at me unblinking down the twenty feet that separated us8212twenty tiny feet and a swath of hallowed ground at least i hoped it was still hallowed ground how did you learn how to do that it said and i stiffened at the odd accent the vowels that seemed to insert themselves into the folds of my brain al i whispered and the demons almostnonexistent eyebrows rose shoulder against the wall i never took my eyes from it as i slid upward to stand this was not the way i wanted to start my day god help me id only been asleep for an hour by the looks of the light whats the matter with you you cant just show up i exclaimed trying to burn off some adrenaline as i stood in the hallway still in the skimpy shirt and shorts i wore to bed no one summoned you and how could you stand on hallowed ground demons cant stand on sacred ground its in every book i do what i want newt peered into the living room poking the staff over the threshold as if looking for traps and assumptions like that will kill you the demon added adjusting the strand of black gold that glinted dully against the midnight red of its robe i wasnt standing on hallowed ground8212you were and minias minias said i wrote most of those books so who knows how right they are its smooth features melted into annoyance at itself not me sometimes i dont remember the past right newt said its voice distant or maybe they simply change it and dont tell me my face went cold in the predawn chill newt was insane i had an insane demon standing in my hallway and roommates coming home in about twenty minutes how could something this powerful survive being this unbalanced but unbalanced seldom equated with stupid though powerful and unbalanced did and clever and ruthless demonic what do you want i asked wondering how long until the sun would rise with a troubled look newt exhaled i dont remember it finally said but you have something of mine i want it back while unknown emotions flitted through and newts thoughts cataloged themselves i squinted down the shadowy hallway trying to decide if it was male or female demons could look like anything they wanted to right now newt had pale eyebrows and a light absolutely even skin tone id say it was feminine but the jaw was strong and those bare feet were too bony to be pretty nail polish would look wrong on them it was wearing the same hat as before8212round with straight sides and a flat top made from a scrumptiously rich red fabric and gold braiding the short nondescript hair falling to just below the ear gave no clue to gender the time id questioned what sex he or she was newt had asked me if it made a difference and watching newt struggle to place a thought i had a feeling it wasnt that the demon didnt think it was important but that newt didnt remember what parts he or she had been born with maybe minias did whoever minias was newt i said hoping my shaking voice wasnt too obvious i demand you leave go directly to the everafter from this place and dont return to bother me again it was a good banishment8212apart from my not having put it in a circle first8212and newt raised one eyebrow at me its puzzlement set aside with an ease that spoke of much practice thats not my summoning name the demon jerked into motion i shrank back to invoke a circle8212paltry though it would be undrawn and unscribed8212but newt stepped into the living room the hem of its robe the last thing i saw slipping around the doorframe from out of sight came the sound of nails being pulled from wood there was a sharp crack of splintering paneling and newt swore colorfully in latin jenkss cat rex padded past me curiosity doing its best to fulfill its promise i lunged after the stupid animal but she didnt like me and so skittered away the caramelcolored kitten paused at the threshold with her ears pricked tail twitching she sat and watched newt wasnt trying to pull me into the everafter and it wasnt trying to kill me it was looking for something and i think the only reason it had possessed me was so it could search the sanctified church which boded well as a sign that the grounds were still holy but the damned thing was crazy who knew how long it would ignore me until it decided i might be able to tell it where it was whatever it was a thump from the living room made me jump tail crooked rex padded in the sudden knocking on the front door of the church spun me the other way to the empty sanctuary but before i could call out a warning the heavy oak door swung open unlocked in expectation of ivys return great now what rachel a worried voice called and ceri strode in fully dressed in faded jeans with dirtwet knees clearly having been in the garden despite it being before sunrise her eyes were wide with worry and her long fair hair billowed about her as she paced quickly across the barren sanctuary tracking in mud from her gardeninappropriate elaborately embroidered slippers she was an elf in hiding and i knew that her schedule was like a pixys awake all day and night but for four hours around each midnight and noon frantic i waved my hands alternating my attention between the empty hallway and her out i all but yelped ceri get out your church bell rang she said cheeks pale with concern as she came to take my hands she smelled wonderful8212the elven scent of wine and cinnamon mixing with the honest smell of dirt8212and the crucifix ivy had given her glinted in the dim light are you all right oh yeah i thought remembering hearing the bell in the belfry toll when i had pushed newt from my thoughts the expression ringing the bells wasnt just a figure of speech and i wondered how much energy i had channeled to make the bell in the tower resonate from the living room came the ugly noise of paneling being ripped from the wall ceris blond eyebrows rose crap she was calm and sedate and i was shaking in my underwear its a demon i whispered wondering if we should leave or try for the circle i had etched in the kitchen floor the sanctuary was still hallowed ground but i didnt trust anything except a welldrawn circle to protect me from a demon especially this one the questioning look on ceris delicate heartshaped face went hard with anger she had spent a thousand years trapped as a demons familiar and she treated them like snakes cautious yes but she had long since lost her fear why are you summoning demons she accused and in your sleepwear her narrow shoulders stiffened i said id help you with your magic thank you very much ms rachel mariana morgan for making me feel worthless i took her elbow and started dragging her backward ceri i pleaded not believing that her delicate temper had taken this the wrong way i didnt call it it showed up on its own like i would even touch demon magic now my soul was already tainted with enough demon smut to paint a gymnasium at that ceri pulled me to a stop steps from the open sanctuary demons cant show up on their own she said the flicker of concern returning as her white fingers touched her crucifix someone must have summoned it then let it go improperly the soft scuff of bare feet at the end of the hallway cut through me like a gunshot my pulse catching i turned ceris attention following mine an instant later cant8212or dont newt said the kitten was in its arms paws kneading ceris knees buckled and i reached for her dont touch me she shrieked and i was suddenly battling her as she swung blindly pulling from me and lunging into the sanctuary shit i think were in trouble i lurched after her but she jerked me back when we found the middle of the empty space sit she said her hands shaking as she tried to yank me down okay we werent leaving ceri8212 i began and then my jaw dropped when she flicked a dirtcaked jackknife from her back pocket ceri i exclaimed as she sliced her thumb open blood gushed and while i stared she drew a large circle mumbling latin her waistlength almosttranslucent hair hid her features but she was trembling my god she was terrified ceri the sanctuary is holy i protested but she tapped a line and invoked her circle a blackstained field of everafter rose to encompass us and i shuddered feeling the smut of her past demon magic slither over me the circle was a good five feet in diameter rather large for one person to hold but ceri was probably the best ley line practitioner in cincinnati she cut her middle finger and i grabbed her arm ceri stop were safe wideeyed in panic she shoved me off her and i fell into the inside of her field hitting it like a wall get out of the way she ordered starting to draw a second circle inside the first shocked i pulled myself to the center and she smeared her blood behind me ceri8212 i tried again stopping when i saw her intertwining the line with the first enforcing it id never seen that before latin words fell from her lips dark and threatening pinpricks of power crawled over my skin and i stared when she cut her pinkie and started a third circuit silent desperate tears marked her face as she finished and invoked it a third sheet of black rose over us heavy and oppressive she switched the filthy gardening blade to her bloodied hand and shaking prepared to cut her left thumb stop i protested frightened i grabbed her wrist sticky with her own blood her head swung up blue eyes lost in terror met mine her skin was chalk white its okay i said wondering what newt had done to cause this selfassured unflappable woman to lose it were in the church its sanctified you built a damn fine circle i looked at it humming over my head worried the triple circle was black with a thousand years of curses that algaliarept the demon id saved her from made her pay for id never felt such a strong barrier ceris pretty head shook back and forth lips parted to show tiny teeth you have to call minias god help us you have to call him minias i questioned who in hell is minias newts familiar ceri stammered her blue eyes showing her fear was she nuts newts familiar was another demon give me that knife i said wrestling it from her her thumb was bleeding and i looked for something to wrap it in we were safe newt could have the run of the back for all i cared sunup was near and id sat in a circle and waited for it before memories of my exboyfriend nick rose through me and vanished you have to call him ceri gushed and i stared when she fell to her knees and started scribing a platesize circle with her blood tears spotting the old oak timbers as she worked ceri its okay i said standing over her in confusion but when she looked up my confidence faltered no it isnt she said her voice low the elegant accent that gave away her royal beginnings now carrying the sound of defeat a wave of something pulsed bending the bubble of force that sheltered us my gaze went to the half sphere of everafter around us and from above came a clear bong of the church bell resonating the black sheet protecting us quivered flashing the pure color of ceris blue aura for an instant before returning to its demonfouled black state from the archway at the back of the church came newts soft voice dont cry ceri it wont hurt as bad the second time ceri jerked and i snatched her arm to keep her from running for the open door and breaking her own circle her flailing hand struck my face and at my yelp she collapsed to slump at my feet newt broke the sanctity ceri said around her sobs she broke it i cant go back there al lost a bet and i twisted her curses for ten years i cant go back there rachel frightened i put my hand on her shoulder but then hesitated newt was female then my face blanked newt was in the hallway 8212the sanctified part my thoughts returned to that pulse of energy ceri had once said it was possible for a demon to desanctify the church but that it was unlikely as it cost far too much and newt had done so without a thought shit swallowing i looked to find newt framed by the hallway well within what had been holy ground rex was still in the demons arms smiling a stupid cat smile the orange feline wouldnt let me touch her but shed purr while an insane demon petted her figures with her black staff tucked in the crook of her elbow and draped in her elegantly cut robes newt looked almost biblical her femininity was obvious once her gender was settled her black unblinking eyes placidly taking in ceris circle in the middle of the allbutbarren sanctuary i crossed my arms over myself to hide my near nakedness not that there was that much to hide my heart pounded and my breath came fast the demon mark on the underside of my foot8212proof that i owed newt a favor for returning me back from the everafter into reality last solstice8212throbbed as if aware that its maker was in the room from beyond the tall stainedglass windows and the open front door came the soft whoosh of a passing car and the twitters of early birds i prayed the pixies would stay in the garden the knife was red and sticky in my hand from ceris blood and i felt ill its too late to flee she said taking the knife back call minias newt stiffened rex jumped from her arms to land upon my desk panicked the cat leapt to the floor scattering papers as she streaked into the hall red robe furling newt strode to ceris circle slamming her spinning staff into it minias doesnt belong here she shouted give it to me its mine i want it back adrenaline made my head hurt i watched the circle quiver then hold we have only moments after she becomes serious ceri whispered whitefaced but looking more collected can you distract her i nodded and ceri began to prepare her spell tension pulled my shoulders tight and i prayed my conversation skills were better than my magic what do you want tell me and ill give it to you i said voice quaking newt began to pace the circle looking like a caged tiger as her deep red robe hissed against the floor i dont remember confusion made her face hard dont call him the demon warned black eyes shining every time i do he makes me forget i want it back and you have it oh this just gets better and better newts gaze went to ceri and i blocked her view i had a halfsecond warning before the demon again jabbed her staff at the circle corrumpro she shouted as it connected at my feet ceri trembled when the outermost circle flashed into utter blackness as newt owned it with a little smile newt touched the circle and it vanished to leave two thin shining bands of unreality between us and death dressed in a dark red robe and wielding a black staff your skills are much improved cerdiwen merriam dulciate newt said al is an exceptional teacher perhaps enough that you might be worth my kitchen ceri didnt look up the curtain of her pale hair hid what she was doing and its tips were stained red from her blood my breath was fast and i continued to turn to keep newt in sight until my back was again facing the open door to the church i remember you newt said tapping the butt of her staff along the circle where it met the floor each jab sent a deeper wash of black crawling over the barrier i put your soul back together when you traveled the lines you owe me a favor i stifled a shiver when the demons gaze went past my bare pasty legs to ceri give me ceri and ill call it null i stiffened kneeling behind me ceri found her strength i have my soul she stated voice quivering i dont belong to anyone newt seemed to shrug fingers playing with her necklace ceris signature is all over the imbalance on your soul the demon said to me as she moved to ivys piano and turned her back on me she is twisting curses for you and youre taking them if that doesnt make her your familiar then what does she twisted a curse for me i admitted watching the demons long fingers caress the black wood but i took the imbalance not her that makes her my friend not my familiar but newt had apparently forgotten us standing beside ivys piano the robed figure seemed to gather the power of the room into her turning all that had once been holy and pure to her own purpose here she murmured i came to get something of mine you stole but this tucking her staff into the crook of her arm newt bowed her head and held it this bothers me i dont like it here it hurts why does it hurt here keeping newt distracted while ceri worked was well and good but the demon was nuts the last time i had run into newt she had been at least rational but this was unimaginable power fueled by insanity it was here the demon shouted and i jumped stifling a gasp ceris breath caught audibly as newt turned her black eyes full of malevolence i dont like this newt accused it hurts it shouldnt hurt you shouldnt be here i said feeling airy and unreal as if i were balancing on a knifes edge you should go home i dont remember where home is newt said vehement anger colored her soft voice ceri tugged at me its ready she whispered call him i pulled my eyes from newt as the demon began to circle again dropping my attention to the ugly elaborate twinringed pentagram drawn with ceris blood you think calling one demon to take care of another is a good idea i whispered and newts pace quickened hes the only one who can reason with her she said panicked and desperate please rachel id do it but i cant its demon magic i shook my head her familiar would you have helped al while newt chuckled over my nickname for algaliarept her demon captor ceris chin trembled newt is insane she whispered you think i snapped jumping when newt slammed a side kick into the barrier her robes swirling dramatically great she knew martial arts on top of everything else why not shed obviously been around a while thats why she has a demon for a familiar ceri said eyes flicking nervously they had a contest the loser became her familiar hes more of a caretaker and hes probably looking for her they dont like it when she slips his watch the lights in my head started to go on and my mouth dropped open seeing my understanding ceri tugged me down to her pentagram drawn in blood grabbing my wrist she tuned it palm side up and aimed for my finger with her knife hey i shouted snatching my hand back ceri looked at me her lips pressed together she was getting bitchy that was good it meant she thought she8212we8212might live through this do you have a finger stick she snapped no then let me cut your finger youre already bleeding i said use your blood mine wont work she said from between gritted teeth its demon magic and8212 yeah i got it i interrupted her blood didnt have the right enzymes and thanks to some illegal genetic tinkering to save my life i had survived being born possessing them the humming presence of the circle above us seemed to hesitate and newt made a sound of success ceri shuddered as she lost control of the middle circle and newt took it down one thin fragile circle left i held out my hand8212consumed with fear ceris eyes met mine stress making her angular features beautiful i only looked ugly when i got scared newts hand hovered over the last circle smiling evilly as she muttered latin it had become a race ceri made a quick swipe at my finger and i jerked against the sting watching a bead of red swell what do i do i asked not liking this at all blue eyes dropping she turned my hand palm down and set it in the circle the old oak seemed to vibrate as if its stored life force were running through me connecting me to the spinning of the earth and the burning of the sun its a public curse she said her words falling over themselves the invocation phrase is mater tintinnabulum say it and miniass name in your thoughts and the curse will put you through dont summon minias newt threatened and i felt ceris control over the last circle swell while the demon was distracted hell kill you faster than i will you arent summoning him youre asking for his attention ceri said desperately the imbalance would normally go to you but you can bargain with newts location and hell take it if he doesnt i will it was a huge concession from the smutcovered elf this was looking better and better but the sun wasnt up yet and newt looked ready to tear us apart i didnt think ceri could hold her concentration much longer against a master demon and i had to believe that the demons possessed a way to control this member of their species otherwise theyd be dead already if his name was minias and he masqueraded as her familiar then thats the way it was hurry ceri whispered sweat tracking her face youll probably show up as an unregistered user but unless shes cursed him again hes likely looking for her and will answer unregistered i wondered licking my lips i closed my eyes i was already connected to the line so all that was left was invoking the curse and thinking his name mater tintinnabulum minias i thought not expecting anything to happen my breath came in a quick heave and i felt ceris hand clamp on my wrist forcing my own to stay in the circle a jolt of everafter spun from me colored with my aura i felt it leave me like a winging bird and i struggled to hold myself together as i saw it flee in my imagination taking a portion of me with it i wont let him steal it from me newt shouted its mine i want it back concentrate ceri whispered and i fell into myself feeling that freed slice of me ring like a bell through the entirety of the everafter and like a ringing bell it was answered im a little busy came an irritated thought leave a message on the damned landline and ill get back to you i shuddered at the sensation of thoughts not my own curling through my mind but ceri kept my hand unmoving within minias was a background clutter of worry guilt aggravation but he had dismissed me like a telemarketer and was ready to snap the connection newt i thought take the imbalance for my calling you and ill tell you where she is and promise you wont hurt us i added or let her hurt us and get her the hell out of my church hurry ceri cried and my concentration bobbled done the voice thought decisively miniass worry sharpened to a point and joined mine where are you my brief elation vanished uh i thought wondering how you give directions to a demon but miniass own thoughts faltered in confusion what the devil is she doing past the lines its almost sunup shes trying to kill me i thought get your ass over here and collect her you arent registered how am i supposed to know where you are ill have to i stiffened jerking my hand out of the circle and ceris grip when the voices presence squeezed my thoughts harder gasping i fell backward onto my butt my body mirroring my attempt to jerk away from miniass presence come though on your thoughts a darkly mellow voice said heavenly father save us ceri gasped my head spun and i caught a glimpse of ceri falling backward she hit her circle and panic iced through me when it broke in a flash of black oh god were dead she met my gaze as she sprawled half upright up on the floor her eyes saying she thought she had killed us newt cried out and i spun where i was sitting only to freeze in shock nothing stood between newt and us now but a man his purple robes reflecting hers in all but color he was barefoot and only now did i remember the flash of those robes coming between me and ceri as he shoved the elf into the bubble to break it so he could get to newt let me go minias newt snarled and my eyes widened at his thickknuckled hand gripping her upper arm she has something of mine i want it back what has she got of yours he asked calmly his back to me newt was a head shorter than minias and it made her look vulnerable despite the scathing vehemence in her voice his voice carried the intent sound of a morethancasual question and my eyes dropped to the grip he had on her staff right above her hand it never eased up not even as his honeyamber voice spilled into the violated sanctuary like a balm soothing yes but holding tension too newt said nothing i could see the hem of her robe past minias tremble i scrambled up ceri finding her feet beside me she didnt bother to reinstate the circle what was the point minias shifted to block newts view he was focused on her but i was sure he was aware of us and he looked like he knew what he was doing i had yet to see his face but his brown hair was short the curls crushed by the same hat newt wore breathe minias said as if trying to trigger something tell me what you want i want to remember she whispered it was as if we werent even in the room anymore so focused were they on each other and only now did miniass grip become gentle then why do you8212 because it hurts she said her bare feet shifting leaning in as if concerned he asked gently why did you come here she was silent and then finally said i dont remember it was agitated8212soft and threatening8212and the only reason i believed her was that she had clearly forgotten before minias had shown up minias lost the last of his anger i felt as if we were witnessing a common but seldomseen event and i hoped he would hold to his promise that they wouldnt take us when they were ready to leave then lets go he soothed and i wondered how much of this was caretaker and how much was simply caring could demons care about each other maybe youll remember when we get back he said turning newt as if he were going to lead her away if you forget something you should go to where you first thought it and it will be waiting for you newt refused to step with him and our eyes met when minias moved out of the way its not at home she said her brow furrowed to show a deep inner pain and under that a seething power held in check by the demon whose grip had slid from her staff to her hand its here not there whatever it is its here or it was here i i know it anger slipped over her brow born from frustration you dont want me to remember she accused i dont want you to remember he asked harshly his hand falling from her and extending in demand give them to me now my gaze flicked between them he had gone from lover to jailer in a pulse im missing my cache of yew he said i didnt make you forget give them to me newts lips pressed together and spots of color appeared on her cheeks it was starting to make sense yew was highly toxic and used almost exclusively in communing with the dead and for making forget charms illegal forget charms i had found a yew in the back of the graveyard by an abandoned mausoleum and though i didnt commune with the dead i had left it hoping that plausible deniability would keep my butt out of court if anyone found it there growing yew wasnt illegal but growing it in a graveyard where the potency was enhanced was i made them newt snapped theyre mine i made them myself she turned to leave and he reached out and spun her back i could see miniass face now he had a strong jaw clenched with emotion his red demon eyes were so dark they almost hid the characteristic goatslitted appearance and his nose was strongly roman anger was heavy on him balancing newts own temper perfectly emotions cascaded over them both in a rapid fluid torrent it was as if a fiveminute argument were passing in three seconds her face changing his responding causing a shift of her mood that was reflected in his body language he carefully manipulated her this demon who had removed the sanctity of the church without a second thought who had turned a triple bloodcircle to her will8212something that i had been told was impossible but of which ceri had known newt was fully capable i didnt know whom to be more frightened of8212newt who could plague the world or minias who controlled her please he asked when her face shifted to chagrin and her black eyes dropped hesitating briefly she reached into the pocket of her expansive sleeve and handed him a fistful of vials how many did you invoke when you remembered he asked the vials clattering newts eyes went to the floor beaten but the sly look to her demeanor told me she wasnt sorry about it i dont recall he jiggled them in his hand before pocketing them clearly seeing her unrepentant mood there are four missing she looked at him real tears showing it hurts she said scaring the crap out of me newt had inflicted her own memory loss what had she remembered that she didnt want to ceri was standing beside me almost forgotten and she slumped telling me that it was almost done i wondered how often she had seen this played out his mood easing minias pulled newt close the purple of his robe curving around her newt folded her arms against herself and let him hold her her eyes shut and her head tucked under his chin they looked elegant and selfpossessed standing in their strongly colored robes and proud stances i wondered how i could ever have doubted newts gender it was so clear now and i spared a thought that perhaps she had subtly shifted her appearance seeing them together made a shudder ripple over me minias was the only thing holding newt to her sanity i didnt think he was just her familiar i dont think he had ever been just anything you shouldnt take them he whispered his breath brushing her forehead his voice was captivating moving up and down like music it hurts she said her own voice muffled i know his demonic eyes locked with mine and i shivered thats why i dont like it when you go out without me he said looking at me but talking to her you dont need them breaking our eye contact minias turned her face to his his hand cupping her strong jawline my arms wrapped around my middle i wondered how long they had been together long enough that a forced burden became one willingly shouldered i dont want to remember newt said the things ive done8212 a demon with a conscience why not they did have souls dont minias said interrupting her he held her more gently promise youll tell me the next time you remember something instead of going looking for answers newt nodded then stiffened in his arms thats where i was she whispered and my gut clenched at the sound of realization in her voice minias froze and beside me ceri paled it was in your journals newt exclaimed pushing him away minias fell back wary but the demon was beyond noticing youve been writing it down youve written down everything i remember how much do you have in your books minias how much do you know that i wanted to forget newt he warned his fingers fumbling in his pocket i found them newt shouted you know why im here tell me why am i over here i jumped when ceri gripped my arm shouting in rage newt swung her staff at him miniass fingers danced in the air as if babbling in sign language forming a ley line spell i felt a huge drop as someone pulled on the line out back and with a surprising shout minias ended his spell by popping the lid to a vial hed taken from newt and flinging it at her newt cried out in dismay as the sparkles hung in the air her anger frustration and pain shocking in their depth and then the potion hit her and her face went blank sliding to a stop she blinked glancing over the empty sanctuary with no recognition in her gaze as it landed on ceri and me she saw minias then threw her staff to the floor as if it were a snake it hit with a clatter and bounced outside past the stainedglass windows the robins were singing in the predawn haze but in here it was as if the air were dead minias she said her tone confused and dismayed its done he said gently he came forward scooping up her staff and handing it to her did i hurt you her voice was worried and when minias shook his head relief spilled over her quickly turning to depression i felt sick take me home the demon said glancing at me my head hurts wait for me miniass gaze flicked to mine then returned to her well go together ceri held her breath as the demon approached us his face down and wide shoulders hunched i thought briefly about reinstating the circle but didnt minias stopped before me too close for comfort his tired eyes took in my nightclothes ceris blood staining my hands and the three circles that had nearly failed to stop newt his gaze rose to encompass the interior of the sanctuary with my desk ivys piano and the stark emptiness between them you were the one who stole ceri from her demon he asked surprising me i wanted to explain that it had been a rescue not stealing her but i just nodded his head moved up and down once mocking me and i fixed on his eyes the red was so dark that they looked brown and the characteristic demonic sideways pupil gave me pause your blood kindled the curse he said his red goatslitted eyes darting to the blood circle beside me she told me about shoving you through the lines last winter his eyes traveled over me evaluating no wonder al is interested in you do you have anything that might have attracted her other than the favor i owe her i said my voice shaking i dont think so his eyes dropped to the elaborate circle ceri had drawn for me to contact him with if you think of anything call me ill pick up the imbalance i dont want her coming over here again ceris fingers on my arm tightened yeah me neither i thought stay here he said as he turned away ill be back to settle up alarmed i pulled from ceri whoa hold up demon boy i dont owe you anything his eyebrows were high and mocking when he turned around i owe you idiot the sun is almost up i have to get out of here ill be back when i can ceris eyes were wide somehow i didnt think that having a demon owe me a favor was a good thing hey i said taking a step forward i dont want you just showing up thats rude and really scary he looked impatient to be away as he adjusted his clothing yes i know why do you think demons try to kill their summoners youre crude unintelligent grasping hacks with no sense of social grace demanding we cross the lines and pick up the cost i warmed but before i could tell him to shove it he said ill call first you take the imbalance for that since you asked for it i glanced at ceri for guidance and she nodded the guarantee that he wouldnt show up while i was showering was worth it deal i said hiding my hand so he wouldnt take it from behind him newt eyed me with her brow creased miniass steps were silent as he moved to take her elbow possessively his worried eyes darting to mine his head rose to look past ceri and me to the open door and i heard the lublublub of a cycle pulling into the carport in the time between one heartbeat and the next they vanished i slumped in relief ceri leaned against the piano the flat of her arms getting blood on it her shoulders started to shake and i put a hand on one wanting nothing more than to do the same from outside came the sudden silence of ivys bike turning off and then her distinctive steps on the cement walk so then the pixy says to the druggist jenks said the clatter of his wings obvious 145tax i thought they stayed on by themselves the pixy laughed the tinkling sound of it like wind chimes get it ivy tax tacks yes i got it she muttered her pace shifting as she took the cement steps good one jenks hey the door is open the light coming into the church was eclipsed and ceri pulled herself up wiping her face and smearing it with blood tears and dirt from her garden i could smell the stink of burnt amber on me and throughout the church and i wondered if i would ever feel clean again together we stood numb as ivy halted just past the foyer jenks hovered for three seconds and then dropping swear words like the golden sparkles he was shedding he tore off in search of his wife and kids ivy put a hand on her cocked hip and took in the three8212no four8212circles made of blood me in my pjs and ceri crying silently her hand sticky with drying blood clutching her crucifix what on gods green earth did you do now wondering if id ever sleep again i glanced at ceri i have no idea chapter two i didnt feel good my stomach queasy as i sat on my hardbacked chair in the kitchen at ivys heavy and very large antique table shoved up against an interior wall the sun was a thin slice of gold shining on the stainlesssteel fridge i didnt see that often i wasnt used to being up this early and my body was starting to let me know about it i didnt think it was from the mornings trouble yeah right tugging my terrycloth robe shut i flipped through the yellow pages while jenks and ivy argued by the sink the phone was on my lap so ivy wouldnt take over as i searched for someone to resanctify the church id already called the guys who had reshingled the roof to give us an estimate on the living room they were human and ivy and i liked using them since they generally got here bright and early at noon newt had torn up the carpet and pulled several pieces of paneling off the walls what in hell had she been looking for jenkss kids were in there right now though they werent even supposed to be in the church and by the shrieks and chiming laughs they were making a mess of the exposed insulation turning another thin page i wondered if ivy and i might take the opportunity to do some remodeling there was a nice hardwood floor under the carpet and ivy had a great eye for decorating she had redone the kitchen before id moved in and i loved it the large industrialsized kitchen had never been sanctified having been added on to the church for sunday suppers and wedding receptions it had two stoves8212one electric one gas8212so i didnt have to cook dinner and stir my spells on the same surface not that i made dinner on the stovetop too often it was usually microwave something or cook on ivys hellacious grill out back in the tidy witchs garden between the church and the graveyard proper actually i did most of my spelling at the island counter between the sink and ivys farmhouse kitchen table there was an overhead rack where i hung the herbs i was currently messing with and my spelling equipment that didnt fit under the counter and with the large circle etched out in the linoleum it made a secure place to invoke a magical circle there were no pipes or wires crossing either overhead in the attic or under in the crawl space to break it i knew i had checked the one window overlooked the garden and graveyard making a comfortable mix of my earthy spelling supplies and ivys computer and tight organization it was my favorite room in the church even if most of the arguments took place here the biting scent of rose hips came from the tea ceri had made me before she left i frowned at the pale pink liquid id rather have coffee but ivy wasnt making any and i was going to bed as soon as i got the reek of burnt amber off me jenks was standing on the windowsill in his peter pan pose his hands on his hips and cocky as hell the sun hit his blond hair and dragonflylike wings sending flashes of light everywhere as they moved damn the cost he said standing between my betta mr fish who swam around in an oversize brandy snifter and jenkss tank of brine shrimp money doesnt do you any good if youre dead his tiny angular features sharpened at least not for us ivy ivy stiffened her perfect oval face emptying of emotion on an exhale she drew her athletic sixfoot height up from where shed been leaning against the counter straightening the leather pants she usually wore while on an investigation run and tossing her enviably straight black hair from habit shed had cut it a couple of months ago and i knew she kept forgetting how short it was just above her ears id commented last week that i liked it and she had gotten it styled into downward spikes with gold tips it looked great on her and i wondered where her recent attention to her appearance was coming from skimmer maybe she glanced at me her lips pressed together and spots of color showing on her usually pale complexion the hint of almondshaped eyes gave away her asian heritage and that combined with her small strongly defined features made her striking her eyes were brown most of the time going pupil black when her livingvampire status got the better of her i had let her sink her teeth into me once and though as exhilarating and pleasurable as all hell it had scared the crap out of both of us when she lost control and nearly killed me even so i was willing to cautiously risk trying to find a blood balance ivy flatly refused though it was becoming painfully obvious the pressures were building in both of us she was terrified of hurting me in a haze of bloodlust ivy dealt with fear by ignoring its existence and avoiding its origin but her selfimposed denial was just about killing her even as it gave her strength if my roommatesbusiness partners could be believed finding thrills was what i organized both my daily life and my sex life around jenks called me an adrenaline junkie but if i was making money at it and remembered my limits where was the harm and i knew to the depths of my soul that ivy didnt fall under that looking for a thrill umbrella yes the rush had been incredible but it was the selfworth i had given her that told me it hadnt been a mistake not the blood ecstasy she had instilled for an instant ivy had seen herself as i did strong capable able to love someone fully and be loved in return by giving her my blood i had told her that yes she was worth sacrificing for that i liked her for who she was and that her needs werent wrong needs were needs it was us who labeled them right or wrong i wanted her to feel that way all the time but god help me it had been a rush as if she had heard my thought ivy turned from jenks stop it she said and i flushed she couldnt read my mind but she might as well have a vamps sense of smell was tuned to pheromones she could read my mood as easily as i could smell the sharp scent of rose hips coming from my untouched tea crap ceri really expected me to drink this jenkss wings reddened clearly not liking the shift in topic from how to spend our pooled business money to how to keep our teeth to ourselves and ivy gestured with a long slim hand to include me in their argument its not that i dont want to spend the money she said both soothing and assertive but why do it if a demon will take it down again i snorted turning to the phone book and shifting a page newt isnt just a demon ceri says shes one of the oldest most powerful demons in the everafter and shes stark raving nuts i muttered turning a page to another listing ceri doesnt think shell be back ivy crossed her arms to look slinky and svelte so why bother resanctifying at all jenks snickered yeah rache why bother i mean this could be good ivy could invite her mom over for a housewarming weve been here a year and the woman is dying to come over well at least she would be if she were still alive worried i looked up from the phone book alarm sifted over ivy for a moment it was so quiet i could hear the clock above the sink and then ivy jerked her speed edging into that eerie vamp quickness she took pains to hide give me the phone she said snatching it the black plastic slipped from my lap and ivy drew the heavy book off the table retreating to her end of the table with quick steps she set the directory on her knees and pulled a legal pad from a stack while jenks laughed she sketched a graph with columns headed by phone number availability cost and religious affiliation confident wed be on holy ground before the week was out i stifled my ire that she had taken over jenks was smiling when he flitted from the windowsill gold sparkles landing in my teacup before he settled beside it thanks i said knowing ivy would hear me even if i whispered i dont think im going to sleep again until were resanctified8212and i like sleeping head bobbing in an exaggerated motion he nodded why dont you just put the church in a circle he questioned nothing can get through that it wouldnt be secure unless we removed all the electricity and gas lines coming in i explained not wanting to tell him that newt could apparently get through any circle with enough reason you want to live without your mtv oh hell no he said glancing at ivy when she offered the person on the phone double to get the job done before sunset tonight ivy didnt get along with her mother very well tired i slumped back into my chair feeling the weight of the insane morning hour fall on me jenkss wife matalina had gotten the pixy kids out of the living room and the sound of them in the garden slipped in with the morning breeze ceri said if newt doesnt show up in the next three weeks shell probably forget about us i said around a yawn but i still want to get the church resanctified i looked at my chipped nail polish in dismay minias hit her with a forget charm but the demon is freaking crazy and she shows up without being summoned ivy stopped talking on the phone and after she and jenks exchanged a look she clicked it off without saying goodbye who is minias newts familiar i gave her a tightlipped smile to soften the shortness of my answer sometimes ivy was like an exboyfriend hell she was like that most times as her vampire instincts fought with her reasoning i was not her shadow aka source of blood but living with her blurred the lines between what she knew and how her instincts said she should feel she remained silent clearly having heard the lack of completeness i didnt want to talk about it the fear being too damn close to my skin literally i stank like the everafter and all i wanted was to clean up and hide under my covers for the next three days having had newt in my head gave me the willies even if id regained control almost immediately ivy took a breath to press for more dissuaded when jenks clattered a warning with his wings id tell the whole story just not now my blood pressure dropped at jenkss show of support and lurching to my feet i went to the pantry for the mop and bucket if we were going to have a holy person in our church i wanted the blood circles gone i mean really youve been up since noon yesterday i can do that ivy protested but lack of sleep had made me bitchy and i dropped the bucket in the sink slamming the cupboard door under it when i brought out the disinfectant and tossed the scrub brush in youve been up as long as i have i said over the rush of water and youre arranging whos going to bless the grounds the sooner we get that done the better ill sleep something i was taking care of until you butted in i thought snarkily as i took off the metallic bracelet kisten had given me and draped it around the base of mr fishs bowl the black gold of the chain and mundane charms glittered and i wondered if i should take the time to try to put a ley line spell into them or just leave them as something pretty to wear the sharp orange scent tickled my nose and i shut off the tap my back protesting i lugged the bucket over the edge of the counter spilling some i awkwardly rubbed the mop over the drops and headed out bare feet squeaking its not a biggie ivy i said five minutes the clatter of pixy wings followed me isnt newts familiar a demon jenks asked when he landed on my shoulder okay so maybe it hadnt been a show of support but merely him wanting to feel me out as to what info to give ivy she was a worrywart and the last thing i wanted was her thinking i couldnt go out for a can of spam without her protection he was a better judge of her mood than i was so i set the bucket by the circles and whispered yeah but hes more of a caretaker tinks a disney whore he swore taking a potshot at his infamous kin as i plunged the mop up and down a few times before squeezing out the excess water dont tell me you got another demon mark he left my shoulder when i sent the mop across the floor apparently finding the backandforth motion too much to take no he owes me i said nervously and jenkss jaw dropped im going to see if hell take als mark off me in exchange or maybe newts jenks hovered before me and i straightened tired as i leaned on the mop his eyes were wide and incredulous the pixy had a wife and way too many kids living in a stump in the garden he was a family man but he had the face and body of an eighteenyearold a very sexy tiny eighteenyearold with wings and sparkles and a mop of blond hair that needed arranging his wife matalina was a very happy pixy and she dressed him in skintight outfits that were distracting despite his minute size that he was nearing the end of his life span was killing me and ivy both he was more than a steadfast partner skilled in detection infiltration and security8212he was our friend you think the demon will do that jenks said damn rache thatd be great i shrugged its worth a shot but all i did was tell him where newt was from the kitchen came ivys voice raised in irritation its 1597 oakstaff yes there was a hesitation then really i didnt know you kept those kinds of records it would have been nice if someone had told us we were a paranormal city shelter shouldnt we be getting a tax break or something her voice had gone wary and i wondered what was up jenks lit on the edge of the bucket wiping a spot to sit before settling himself his dragonfly wings stilling to look like gossamer the mop wasnt doing it i would have to scrub sighing i dropped to my knees and felt around the bottom of the bucket for the brush no it was sanctified ivy continued her voice growing louder clear over the hiss of the bristles it isnt anymore a slight pause and she added we had an incident another hesitation and she said we had an incident how much to do the entire church my stomach clenched when she added softly how much to do just the bedrooms i looked at jenks guilt rising thick in me maybe we could get the city to defray the cost if we refiled as a city shelter it wasnt as if we could ask the landlord to fix it piscary owned the church and though ivy had dropped the facade of paying rent to the master vampire she looked to we were responsible for the upkeep it was like living rent free in your parents house when they were on an extended vacation8212vacation being jail in this case thanks to me it was an ugly story but at least i hadnt killed him uh for good ivys sigh was audible over the sound of my work can you get out here before tonight she asked making me feel marginally better i didnt hear the answer to that but there was no more conversation forthcoming and i focused on rubbing out the smears moving clockwise as i went jenks watched for a moment from the rim of the bucket then said you look like a porno star on your hands and knees mopping in your underwear push it baby he moaned push it i glanced up to find him making rude motions doesnt he have anything better to do but i knew he was trying to cheer me up8212least thats what i was telling myself as his wings turned red from laughter i jerked my robe closed and sat back on my knees before i blew a shoulderlength red curl from my face taking a swing at his smirk would be useless8212he had gotten really fast since his stint under a demon curse that made him peoplesize and turning my back to him would be worse could you straighten my desk for me i asked allowing a touch of annoyance into my voice your cat dumped my papers you bet he said zipping off immediately i felt my blood pressure drop ivys soft steps intruded and jenks cussed fluently at her when she pulled the papers off the floor and set them on the desktop for him politely telling him to shove a slug up his ass she strode past me to her piano a spray bottle in one hand and a chamois cloth in the other someones coming out this morning she said starting to clean ceris blood from the varnished wood old blood didnt flip any switches in living vamps8212not like the chance to take it did theyre going to give us an estimate and if our credit checks out theyll do the entire church you want to pay the extra five thousand to insure it five thousand to insure it holy crap how much was this going to cost uneasy i sat back up on my heels and dunked the brush my rolledup sleeve slipped soaking in an instant from my desk jenks called out go for it rache it says here you won a million dollars i glanced behind me to find him manhandling my mail irritated i dropped the brush and squeezed the water from my robe can we find out how much its going to cost first i asked and she nodded giving her piano a heavy coat of whatever was in that unlabeled spray bottle it evaporated quickly and she wiped it to a shine here she said setting the bottle down beside the bucket it will get rid of the8212 her words stopped just wipe the floor with it she added and my eyebrows rose okaaay i bent back over the floor hesitating at the circle ceri had scribed to call minias then smeared it to nothing ceri could help me make a new one and i wasnt going to have demonic blood circles on the floor of my church hey ivy jenks called you want to keep this she rocked into motion and i shifted to keep her in my view jenks had a coupon for pizza and i smirked right like she would even consider ordering anything but piscarys pizza what else does she have in here ivy said throwing it away i turned my back on them knowing that the chaos i kept my desk in drove ivy insane shed probably take the opportunity to tidy it god id never be able to find a thing spellofthemonth club toss jenks said and i heard it thunk into the trash can free issue of witch weekly toss credit check toss crap rachel dont you throw anything away i ignored him having only a small arc to finish wax on wax off my arm was hurting the zoo wants to know if you want to renew your offhours runners pass save that i said jenks whistled long and low and i wondered what they had found now an invitation to ellasbeth withons wedding ivy drawled in question oh yeah i forgot about that tink knocks your kickers jenks exclaimed and i sat back on my heels rachel he called hovering over the invitation that had probably cost more than my last dinner out when did you get an invitation from trent for his wedding i dont remember i dunked the brush and started in again but the hush of linen against paper brought me upright hey i protested wiping my hands dry on my robe to make the tie come undone you cant do that its illegal to open mail not addressed to you jenks had landed on ivys shoulder and they each gave me a long look over the invitation in her grip the seal was broken ivy said shaking to the floor the stupid little white tissue paper i had carefully replaced trent kalamack was the bane of my existence one of cincinnatis most beloved councilmen and the northern hemispheres most eligible bachelor no one seemed to care he ran half of the citys underworld and worked a good slice of the worlds illegal brimstone trade that wasnt even considering his punishablebydeath dealings in genetic manipulation and outlawed medicines my being alive because of them was a big part of my keeping quiet about it i didnt like the antarctic any more than the next person and thats where id end up if it got out that is if they didnt just kill me burn me and send my ashes to the sun suddenly having a demon trash my living room didnt seem so bad holy crap jenks swore again ellasbeth wants you to be a bridesmaid jerking my robe closed i stalked across the sanctuary and snatched the invitation out of ivys hand its not an invitation its a badly worded request for me to work security the woman hates me look she didnt even sign it i bet she doesnt even know it exists i waved it in the air and shoved it into a drawer slamming it shut trents fianc233e was a bitch in all ways but the literal thin elegant rich and bitingly polite we had gotten along really well the night we had breakfast together just her me and trent caught between us course part of that might have been from my letting her believe that trent and i had been childhood sweethearts but she was the one who decided i was a courtesan stupid yellow pages ad ivys expression was wary she knew better than to push me when it came to trent but jenks wouldnt let it go yeah but think of it rache its going to be a hell of a party the best of cincinnati is going to be there you never know who will show up i lifted a plant and ran my hand under it8212my version of dusting people who want to kill trent i said lightly i like excitement but im not insane ivy moved my bucket and mop to a dry part of the floor and sprayed a heavy layer of that unlabeled bottle you going to do it she asked as if i hadnt already said no no in one motion i swept all the papers off the desktop and into the uppermost drawer jenks landed on the clean surface his wings stilling as he leaned against the pencil cup and crossed his ankles and arms to look surprisingly alluring for a fourinchtall man why not he accused you think hes going to stiff you again i added in my thoughts because i already saved his freaking elf ass once i said you do it once its a mistake you do it twice and its not a mistake anymore mop and bucket in hand ivy walked out snickering its rsvp by tomorrow jenks needled rehearsal is friday youre invited i know that it was my birthday too and i wasnt going to spend it with trent ticked i headed into the kitchen after ivy flying backward jenks got in my face and preceded me down the hallway slices of sunlight coming in from the living room ive got two reasons you should do it he said one it will piss ellasbeth off and two you could charge him enough to afford to resanctify the church my steps slowed and i tried to keep the ugly look off my face that was unfair by the sink ivy frowned clearly thinking the same jenks im just saying8212 shes not working for kalamack ivy threatened and this time he shut his mouth i stood in the kitchen not knowing why i was here i gotta shower i said go ivy said meticulously8212and needlessly8212washing the bucket with soapy water before putting it away ill wait up for the man coming over with an estimate i didnt like that shed probably fudge on the quote knowing that her pockets were deeper than mine she had told me she was nearly broke but nearly broke for the last living member of the tamwood vampires was not my broke rather more of a downtosixfiguresinherbankaccount broke if she wanted something she got it but i was too tired to fight her i owe you i said as i grabbed the cooled tea ceri had made for me and shuffled out god jenks ivy was saying as i avoided my room with my scattered clothes and just headed for my bathroom the last thing she needs is to be working for kalamack i just thought8212 the pixy said no you didnt think ivy accused trent isnt some pantywaist rich pushover hes a powerhungry murdering drug lord who looks good in a suit you dont think hes got some reason for inviting her to work security other than his welfare i wasnt going to let her go alone he protested and i shut the door sipping the tart tea i dropped my pjs into the washer and got the shower going so i wouldnt have to listen to them sometimes i felt as if they thought i couldnt hear at all just because i couldnt hear a pixy belch across the graveyard yeah theyd had a contest one night jenks won the waters warmth was wonderful and after the sharp scent of pine soap washed away the choking smell of burnt amber i stepped from the shower feeling refreshed and almost awake purple towel wrapped around me i rubbed the mist from the long mirror leaning close to see if i had any new freckles nope not yet opening my mouth i checked out my beautiful pristine teeth it was nice not having any fillings i may have coated my soul in blackness when i had twisted a demon curse to turn into a wolf this spring but i wasnt going to feel guilty over the beautiful unmarked skin i had when i turned back the accumulated damage of twentyfive years of existence had been removed and if i didnt find a way to get rid of the demon smut from twisting the curse before i died i was going to pay for it by burning in hell at least im not going to feel too guilty about it i thought as i reached for my lotion heavy on the spf protection and i certainly wasnt going to waste it my mothers family had come from ireland long before the turn and from my mom i got my red hair my green eyes and my pale skin now as satisfyingly soft and supple as a newborns from my dad i got my height my lean athletic build and my attitude from both of them i got a rare genetic condition that would have killed me before my first birthday if trents father hadnt set himself above the law and fixed it in his illegal genetic lab our fathers had been friends before theyd died a week apart under suspicious circumstances at least they were suspicious to me and that was the reason i distrusted trent if his being a drug lord a murderer and nastily adept at manipulating me werent enough suddenly overcome with missing my dad i shuffled through the cabinet behind the mirror until i found the wooden ring hed given me on my thirteenth birthday it had been the last one wed shared before he died i looked at it small and perfect in my palm and on impulse i put it on i hadnt worn it since the charm it once held to hide my freckles had been broken and i hadnt needed it since twisting that demon curse but i missed him and after being attacked by a demon this morning i could use some serious emotional security i smiled at it circling my pinkie feeling better already the ring had come with a lifetime charm reinstatement and i had an appointment every fourth friday in july maybe id take the madam out for coffee instead ask her about maybe changing it to a sunscreen charm8212if there was such a thing the giveandtake of masculine and feminine voices from the kitchen became obvious as i toweled my hair hes here already i grumbled finding a pair of underwear jeans and a red camisole in the dryer slipping them on i dabbed some perfume behind each ear to help block my scent and ivys from mixing combed my damp hair back with my fingers and headed out but it wasnt a holy man i found in the kitchen covered in pixy children it was glenn
