 chapter 1 carmel california summer wasnt frightened not exactly anxious maybe determined okay just a little frightened being around rich people always left her on edge and these people were very rich she saw the house first huge with gray stone walls and a broad wooden porch an immaculate swath of grass sloped down to rugged boulders above a restless sea as the taxi rounded the drive summer sat up straighter feeling lightyears away from the cement and sprawl of philadelphia shed spent most of the last five years within fifteen miles of the liberty bell but it was clear that carmel was going to be a whole new planet the driver eyed her in the mirror quothavent seen you beforequot summer made a noncommittal sound rolling down her window and nudging off one black high heel which was pinching her toes badly quotgot a nice family up therequot the driver nodded up the cobblestone drive toward the big house quotlookers all of em even the little one odd as she isquot summer frowned at him quot odd howquot quotguess youll find out soon enoughquot his head swung around quotwhat are you family friend or cnn bureau chiefquot quotso you get a lot of reporters down herequot quotbuckets full all summer had that woman diane sawyer a few days back skinnier than she is on tv guess they all arequot the drivers eyes narrowed quotnotice you didnt answer my questionquot quotthats right i didntquot summer looked away mindful of the assignment that brought her here her carefully constructed story seemed almost real to her after the month of preparation shed endured back in philadelphia the fact was this was no vacation and summer was neither family nor friend this was work with a capital wfbi field work shed had tough assignments before but never so close to big money and washington power politics and the situation left her edgy do the job she told herself sternly forget about the nerves the driver pulled to a halt near a wall of bougainvillea flaming crimson against fieldstone walls quotlotta people sniffing around lately brought up a bunch of hollywood types last weekquot the man sniffed with disgust quotall bel air this and rodeo drive thatquot he stopped the taxi and twisted around to face summer quotoutsiders you can spot them a mile awayquot summer glanced at the meter and counted out the hefty fare then added a fair tip quotmovie stars you meanquot quotthose too senator winslow was here to meet them once or twice him id recognize anywhere a popular man with the ladies and easy to see why with that calm grin and the way he looks at you like hes really listening probably all a big act the way i see it most politicians are rats looking for a holequot he took the money summer held out quotyou dont look like youre from hollywood thoughquot as before he tore the word into three disparaging syllables quotdont sound much like one of those airheads from washington dc either too normal for a damned reporterquot he studied her some more putting some thought into it quotodd thing is i cant say what you look likequot which is part of the reason im so good at my job summer thought she opened her door and hefted her suitcase which was full of navy suits and dark shoes just like the ones she was wearing in her particular line of work plain and inconspicuous were definite job assets she decided a little gossip wouldnt hurt her assignment bending close to the window she nodded at the driver quotsharp eyesquot quotso what are youquot summer tucked her briefcase under her arm and smiled quotim the new nannyquot as she rolled her suitcase along the perfectly cut lawn summer scanned her base of operations for the next month her host cara oconnor wasnt on hand to greet her but that had been expected since cara was currently hard at work in san francisco where she was the citys youngest female assistant da summer quickly learned from a chatty housekeeper named imelda that her two charges were upstairs finishing their homework over lemon bars and fruit drinks awaiting her arrival praying she wouldnt be called to explain verb tenses or noneuclidean geometry summer followed the housekeeper out to a spanishstyle guesthouse nearly hidden by towering oleander bushes imelda left so summer could unpack and change before going to meet cara oconnors two daughters wiggling her feet she kicked off her shoes and dropped her suitcase on the sofa which was covered with fluffy pillows fresh roses filled the air with lush perfume summer trailed one finger along the wall of solid fieldstone that led to a sixfoot fireplace some digs not that she was going to get tied up in knots about it no she was going to treat the oconnors like any other assignment summer was about to start undressing when she heard a sound down the hall crossing the room quietly she peered around a corner there was a naked man in her shower six foot four inches of naked man judging by the view she had from her location near the living room summer took a sharp breath and forced herself to be calm granted she had just staggered off two backtoback flights and her eyes were burning with exhaustion but that was definitely the outline of a male body behind the tall glass shower enclosure she was pretty sure that ringing sound was water running while that other sound low and rumbling was a dark male groan of satisfaction her stomach clenched either there was a big mistake or this was another trick she had suffered constant hazing on the job over the last months from little things like papers taken off her desk to coffee spilled inside her locker as the junior field officer summer had been prepared for a certain amount of hazing but this crossed the line she glared at the broad shoulders moving back and forth beneath a stream of hot water no doubt this little surprise came courtesy of her fellow agents back in philadelphia with a few wellchosen questions any one of them could have pinpointed her newest assignment not all of them hated her but most of them did and words werent going to change that as summer stood listening to the sound of the shower something stabbed hard at the center of her chest they wouldnt forget they wanted payback any way that would hurt her most well to hell with her pals back in philadelphia and to hell with their crude tricks summer was staying right where she was they werent going to spook her silently she checked the small desk near the sofa a tan envelope lay on its side next to a painted chinese vase across the middle of the envelope she saw her name written in small elegant letters her name her rooms no mistakes there exhausted and grimy from hours of travel she stared at the cozy fruit basket on the lacquer dresser the lush roses in crystal vases no way was she leaving summer set her briefcase down carefully on the thick rug her raincoat landed on a sleek leather ottoman nearby fighting her anger she scanned the room again there were no signs of someone living hereno dirty socks on the floor no clean shirts hanging in the closet the bed in the adjoining room was perfectly neat with no dents in the pillows beyond the living area water continued to strike the glass walls of the shower as summer glared at her intruder the towel hanging over the door slid free suddenly she had an unobstructed view of a narrow waist sculpted thighs and a worldclass naked body a little voice whispered a warning punchy with fury she ignored it squaring her shoulders she sat down in a velvet chair at the entrance to the bathroom where she had a full view of the sunny shower enclosure he was singing an old beatles songlow and very offkeywhen the water hissed off the shower door slid open definitely a worldclass body the man had the sculpted shoulders of an athlete in superb condition and abs to bounce a dime off of as he ran his hands over his face drops of warm water clung to the dark hair on his chest then slowly traveled lower an odd tingle shot through summers stomach she hadnt planned to look but she found herself looking anyway there was no avoiding the fact that the man had excellent muscles especially when he turned and saw her his body locking hard quotdont tell me youre the maidquot he had the hint of an accent something smoky and rough that summer couldnt trace quotguestquot she countered flatly quotand unless you talk fast youre spending the night as a guest of the local police palquot a smile played across his mouth quotnow youre terrifying mequot the roughness was there again but there wasnt a hint of anxiety in his cool smile or the slow way he scooped up his towel and tossed it over his shoulder where it concealed nothing obviously modesty was a foreign concept to the man summer prayed to six patron saints for the ability to stay cool under his unrelenting stare but the prayers werent working heat rose in her face and fingers of awareness nudged a dozen sensitive nerve centers probably the result of the industrialstrength dramamine shed taken on the plane dulling her normal edge or maybe it was the mans cocky smile as he draped the towel low around his waist she was an expert in the weaver stance and shotgun recoil she knew about bomb dogs wire fraud and chain of custody for criminal evidence but no one at quantico had taught her the proper procedure for a naked smartass when said naked smartass was standing in your shower whistling quotpenny lanequot quotget outquot she said tightly quototherwise youre going to be kissing the floor and trust me i wont make it nicequot his brow rose quotyou know judoquot quotaikidoquot suddenly his eyes were dark and focused quotyoure the new nannyquot quotthats right and you arequot quotgabe morganlandscape and general contracting the girls told me you werent coming until later tonight my showers been acting up so i thought id sneak over and clean up before you arrivedquot as an apology it stunk as an explanation it was passableassuming that summer believed him which she didnt quot the girlsquot quotthe two oconnor kids audra and sophy they told me when you were to arrivequot summer smiled tightly quotas you can see they were wrongquot quotin that case sorry for the intrusion no reason for things to get off on the wrong foot because of itquot quotid say its a perfect reasonquot he crossed his arms and summer worked hard not to stare at the fine display there was a small scar near the top of his shoulder that curved down in a tight hook from a gardening tool quotthe old nanny let the girls run wild clearly youre going to be a lot stricterquot quotim not getting paid to let them run wild mr morganquot quotcall me gabequot why was he standing there holding a conversation in his towel for heavens sake why didnt the man just go quoti doubt ill call you anything until you get some clothes onquot quottoo badquot once again the grin teased his lips quotclothes can be damned overrated maamquot quotnot by mequot gabe morgan shook his head quotthings were just starting to get interesting tooquot he gave a twofinger wave as he crossed the living room quotill talk to audra and sophy about this im pretty sure its their harebrained idea of a joke on the new nanny meanwhile enjoy the shower now that i got things all warmed up for youquot he tightened his towel opening the front door quotby the way theyre good kids but you should tan their hides for this little stunt its a war out there and the kids are winning from what i hearquot quotthank you for the astute advice mr morgan i assure you i know how to do my jobquot summer said stiffly quotglad to hear it let me know if you need any helpquot summer crossed her arms quoti wontquot shed studied enough books on the subject in the last three weeks to tackle anything that was thrown at her so she hoped the towel slid lower on his lean hips summer was pretty sure her mouth was hanging open she might drool any second quotwhatever you say night ms mulvaneyquot she hadnt told him her name the door closed summer sank back in the velvet chair outside the shower feeling steam brush her face like a warm caress she tried to forget his body and his grinand failed at both during her fbi career shed had her share of aggravating assignments some of them had been high profile and some of them had put her squarely in the path of grievous bodily harm something told her this one was going to take the cake gabe morgan felt like shit leave it to cara oconnors kids to set up something lowdown and sneaky like this not that he minded being caught buck naked but the new nanny had looked angry enough to char steak as soon as the door to his guesthouse had closed gabe tossed down his towel and prowled through his living room the woman didnt even look like a nanny for gods sake since gabe had only met one other nanny in his life he didnt have a lot to compare by but he was pretty sure nannies were starched and prim expert at holding hands defusing temper tantrums and hiding any real honest thoughts not summer mulvaney beneath that dark suit she looked strong and surprisingly wellconditioned besides that there was her kickass attitude the woman was cool and confident with an intensity that had caught him by surprise she didnt mince words and he was pretty sure she didnt take crap from anyone it was a trait gabe morgan had always admired whether in men or women but something about summer mulvaney bothered him she didnt come across as your average gardenvariety nanny or nurturer then again maybe he was crazy there was no denying that this job was starting to get to him frowning gabe shoved away thoughts of the new nanny as he rustled through his bureau tugged on clothes and located three fresh surgical bandages hed tackle fifty situps and twenty squats then see if he could push himself any further after that hed wrap his knee and take a short break then start all over again he was so used to seeing the scars on his body that they might as well have been invisible even the memories had begun to blur their grim details fading into a graygreen blur of jungle sky and bluegreen water
