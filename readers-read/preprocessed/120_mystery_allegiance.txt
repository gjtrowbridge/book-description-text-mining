 8220he8217s at least an embezzler my lord8221 mara said 8220i don8217t yet know whether or not he8217s committed actual treason8221 8220i consider theft of imperial funds to be treason8221 the emperor countered 8220your part in this is now ended my child8211others will carry on from here you have done well8221 8220thank you8221 mara said feeling the warmth of his approval 64258ow through her 8220then unless there8217s something more urgent pending i8217d like permission to do an investigation of the six artworks i found in glovstoak8217s safe the ones i examined appear to be from a batch of ten that were stolen from a gallery 64257ve years ago during an attack on a rebel cell on krintrino8221 the emperor8217s face darkened 8220so as well as being an embezzler glovstoak may also be connected with the rebel alliance8221 8220or he may have a connection with the imperial forces who carried out the attack8221 mara pointed out a little cautiously the emperor was a wise and good man but he had an odd tendency sometimes to see rebels and rebel conspiracies where they might not actually exist 8220or it could have been pirates or thieves who simply took advantage of the attack8217s chaos to grab and run the interesting point is that glovstoak apparently bought them through an auction house which suggests he and the seller wanted a stamp of legitimacy put on the transfer8221 8220you said ten were stolen8221 the emperor said 8220yet only six were in glovstoak8217s safe8221 8220yes8221 mara con64257rmed 8220 and all six were apparently bought at the same time about eighteen months ago8221 8220where are the other four8221 8220as far as i know they8217re still missing8221 mara said 8220that8217s one of the questions i8217d like an answer to another is why the original owner suddenly decided he needed such a large in64258ux of cash a year and a half ago8221 for a minute the emperor remained silent and mara felt a 64258icker of satisfaction private transfers of valuable objects happened all the time across the empire for any number of legitimate or borderlineshady reasons such questions coming from many of the emperor8217s other advisers and assistants would likely have been dismissed out of hand as irrelevant but mara was the emperor8217s hand recruited and trained personally by him and he trusted her instincts 8220the loss of the death star was a great shock to even my strongest supporters8221 he said at last 8220some perhaps might be wondering if my empire is indeed the likely winner in this con64258ict with the rebel alliance8221 8220of course it is8221 mara said automatically the emperor gave her another thin smile 8220indeed8221 he agreed 8220but not everyone sees things as clearly as you and i if glovstoak is not connected to the rebellion perhaps one of our wealthier citizens has decided to play both sides tell me what is the current rebel presence in shelsha sector8221 8220i don8217t know yet8221 mara said 8220i was planning to comm shelkonwa and ask governor choard8217s of64257ce to prepare a summary for me8221 8220don8217t8221 the emperor said the corners of his lips turning down with contempt 8220barshnis choard is a competent administrator but he has far too many ties with the wealthy and powerful of his sector he might leak news of your investigation to the very people you seek no you will instead use my personal library for your research8221 mara bowed her head 8220thank you my lord8221 the emperor held out his hand to her 8220go8221 he said mara stepped forward and took his outstretched hand feeling a fresh wave of warmth and strength 64258ow into her then stepped back again 8220one other thing my lord8221 she said 8220when you have moff glovstoak and his administration arrested i would ask that a member of his staff general deerian be exempted from punishment8221 the emperor regarded her thoughtfully 8220you believe him to be innocent of glovstoak8217s treason8221 8220i8217m certain of it8221 mara said 8220he8217s also an honest and honorable man i don8217t wish to see the empire deprived of his service8221 the other8217s lip may have twitched slightly at the word honorable but he merely nodded 8220as you wish my child8221 he said 8220i will have general deerian transferred immediately to a position here on imperial center where he will remain untouched by glovstoak8217s imminent destruction8221 8220thank you8221 mara said turning she strode across the expanse of the throne room passed between the silent redrobed royal guards and stepped into the turbolift the emperor8217s library was a large and very private place used only by a few of his top people and only with his express permission normally there were a handful of attendants on hand to assist but as mara walked between the tall stacks of data card 64257le cabinets toward the retrieval stations at the center she was struck by the unusual silence apparently all the attendants had suddenly found a need to be elsewhere as she rounded the last cabinet she discovered the reason for their absence seated alone at one of the three computer stations was darth vader 8220lord vader8221 she said politely as she stepped past her eyes 64258icking automatically to the display screen in front of him his arm came up just high enough to block her view 8220emperor8217s hand8221 he greeted her in turn his voice deep and stiff and darker even than usual 8220what do you want8221 8220i was given permission to do some research8221 mara said continuing past him and seating herself at one of the other stations but even as she turned on the console and started keying for her data search she could sense his brooding attention switch from his research to mara herself vader had always been polite enough but even without mara8217s force sensitivity it would have been abundantly clear that he didn8217t like her she8217d never 64257gured out why that was certainly their goals were the same service to the emperor and his new order perhaps he thought her training had taken too much of the emperor8217s time and attention or perhaps he suspected her of trying to supplant him in the great man8217s eyes both thoughts were ridiculous of course mara had her work to do and vader had his and there was no point trying to secondguess the emperor8217s wisdom in the way he employed either of them but she had yet to 64257nd a way to get that message through to vader 8220you seek information on the rebels8221 vader said 8220don8217t we all8221 mara said drily 8220speci64257cally i8217m interested in the ones in shelsha sector would you happen to know anything about that8221 8220there are no known or suspected bases in the sector8221 the dark lord rumbled 8220the single major listening post was raided and destroyed a few days ago i suspect there to also be some important supply lines running through the sector but that has yet to be veri64257ed8221 8220any important sympathizers8221 the sense of coldness around him deepened 8220there are sympathizers everywhere8221 he said 8220as well as others who conspire to overthrow their superiors8221 mara felt an unpleasant trickle run through her 8220lord vader rest assured that i have no intention82118221 8220good day emperor8217s hand8221 vader cut her off with a swirl of black cloak he stood turning off the console as he did so turning his back he strode away 8220thank you for your assistance lord vader8221 mara called after him the other didn8217t reply the sense of coldness fading as he departed the door slid open at his gesture and he strode from the library mara took a deep breath let it out in a weary sigh what was he worried about anyway loyalty was after all one of the emperor8217s greatest qualities loyalty to all who were loyal to him how could vader even think his master would push him aside for anyone else especially for someone as young and inexperienced as mara shaking her head she turned back to her console forcing her mind back to her job so the rebels had supply lines through shelsha sector that was good to know she 64257nished keying in her request for general rebel data then added a search for major and minor traf64257c lanes outoftheway spaceports and any known centers of smuggling or other criminal activity the computer set to work and mara sat back to wait and as she hunched her tired shoulders her eyes drifted over to vader8217s console the dark lord was never very pleasant but as she thought back on their brief encounter it seemed to her that he8217d been even more on edge than usual maybe she could 64257nd out why she glanced toward the exit as she stood up and went to the other console wondering brie64258y what vader would do if he caught her at this but it was too good an opportunity to pass up sitting down she turned on the machine there was a computer trick the dark lord might not know how to block he didn8217t punching in the proper code mara pulled up the last 64257le that had been accessed from that terminal it was a search program a highly sophisticated one too that had been busily sifting through the personnel records of hundreds of star systems when vader had interrupted its work and shut it down and not just the personnel records but also movement and sighting reports 64257nancial pro64257les travel permits and every other means the empire had at its disposal for locating or tracking one of its citizens she scrolled up to the top looking for the target list of names if vader was trying to track down prince xizor8217s black sun connections again the emperor was going to be very annoyed with him but to her mild surprise there was only one name on the list luke skywalker mara frowned searching her memory had she ever heard that name before she didn8217t think so but then she was barely eighteen and new to the imperial court in the meantime she had her own work to do filing away the name for future reference she shut down the console and returned to her own search to han8217s complete lack of surprise the rendezvous turned out to be like all the rest of the little hideyholes general rieekan seemed to have stashed around the empire it was quiet reasonably private and about as sorry an excuse for a military base as he8217d ever seen still it did have one redeeming value leia was there 8220han8221 she greeted him with her usual of64257cial smile as he strode down the falcon 8217s ramp 8220sounds like you had something of a close call8221 8220not really8221 he assured her smiling back the cool formality of her smile didn8217t fool him for a minute of course 8220everyone else get through okay8221 8220mostly8221 she said a hint of a frown crossing her face 8220chivkyrie still hasn8217t shown up8221 han glanced over his shoulder to where luke and chewbacca were helping the techs pull their equipment out of the falcon 8217s holds 8220you want chewie and me to go 64257nd him8221 8220i8217m afraid it8217s not that kind of problem8221 she said ruefully 8220we8217re having some problems with his whole organization8221 8220ah8211politics8221 han said nodding 8220in that case you can leave me out of it8221 8220yes i thought as much8221 leia said 8220by the way mon mothma wants to see all of us8211you luke and me8211in the command center8221 8220who8221 8220mon mothma8221 leia repeated patiently 8220the alliance supreme commander8221 8220oh8221 han said as the memory of the name 64257nally surfaced 8220her8221 8220yes her 8221 leia said 8220she has a job for us8221 han suppressed a grimace there it was again everyone just assuming he and chewbacca were of64257cially aboard this leaky ship 8220fine8221 he said 8220we8217ll be there when we8217re 64257nished8221 leia raised her eyebrows slightly and for a second he thought she was going to remind him of his place but maybe she remembered in time that he didn8217t really have one 8220we8217ll see you then8221 she said and moved off 8220trouble8221 luke asked from behind him han turned to see the kid walking toward him 8220no more than usual8221 he said 8220why8221 8220leia looked like she was worried8221 8220her royal highness is always worried8221 han growled annoyed in spite of himself ever since they8217d pulled the princess off the death star luke had been mooning over her and ever since yavin he8217d fancied they had the kind of deep spiritual connection where he could sense her moods and feelings or maybe it was part of this whole jedi knight kick he8217d gotten on sometimes it was hard for han to 64257gure out which part of luke8217s personality was the most annoying still the kid was mostly okay better than a lot of the people han had had to deal with over the years 8220she8217s got a lot of responsibility8221 luke reminded him quietly 8220and alderaan wasn8217t all that long ago8221 han grimaced the kid was right of course leia had been too busy right then to react much but ever since yavin she8217d had more than enough time for the grief and horror of her world8217s destruction to start weighing in and if it came to that luke had had a couple of recent kicks in the teeth too what with 64257rst losing his aunt and uncle and then watching old man kenobi get killed right in front of him the least han could do was cut them some slack both of them 8220yeah i know8221 he said 8220by the way our glorious supreme commander wants us in the command center when we have time8221 8220great8221 luke said visibly brightening at the prospect of another assignment 8220let8217s go chewie can direct the rest of the unloading8221 jump when ordered the old military adage ran through han8217s mind ask 8220how high8221 on the way up whatever reservations han might still have about this rebellion luke had clearly jumped in with both feet had jumped was on his way up and wasn8217t even bothering to ask how high cut them some slack han reminded himself 64257rmly lots of slack 8220sure8221 he said 8220let8217s see what her highest highness wants8221 mon mothma was a regallooking woman with short auburn hair and pale greenish blue eyes she wore a simple white robe decorated only by a medallion of some sort around her neck seated at the head of the plotting table 64258anked by general rieekan on her right and leia on her left she was exactly what luke would expect to 64257nd as the head of the rebel alliance warm strong and determined 8220thank you for your time here today captain solo master skywalker8221 she said nodding gravely to each of them in turn 8220both of you have served the rebellion bravely and the entire galaxy owes you a great debt now i8217ve come here to ask you to perform yet another service for us8221 glancing at han luke saw the wary look in his eye and the slight curl to his lip 8220we8217d be delighted82118221 he began 8220we8217re listening8221 han cut him off luke winced but mon mothma either didn8217t notice the brusqueness or else chose to ignore it 8220as you know the rebel alliance is made up of many groups that once fought their own individual wars against emperor palpatine8217s tyranny8221 she said 8220it was only when we began uniting and coordinating our efforts82118221 8220we know the history8221 han interrupted again 8220what8217s the mission8221 beside mon mothma leia stirred in her chair glaring at han in silent warning but again if mon mothma was irritated or insulted she gave no sign 8220one of our member groups the republic redux is led by an adarian named yeeru chivkyrie8221 the older woman said 8220he has a proposal that he believes will give a strong boost to the rebellion8221 8220boosts are good8221 han said 8220what8217s the problem8221 8220the problem8221 mon mothma said 8220is that the leaders of two of the sector8217s other groups are as strongly opposed to the project as chivkyrie is in favor of it8221 8220how strongly8221 han asked mon mothma8217s lips compressed brie64258y 8220they8217re threatening to pull out if chivkyrie8217s plan is accepted8221 8220are they worth keeping8221 han asked luke looked at him in disbelief 8220what kind of question is that8221 8220a perfectly good one8221 han said sounding a little defensive 8220i thought the reason we pulled the teardrop listening post out was because the alliance didn8217t have much of anything going on in shelsha8221 8220actually skywalker it is a good question8221 rieekan said 8220we8217ve had trouble getting a real foothold in the sector partly because of cultural problems partly because of in64257ghting like this8221 8220if you go strictly by numbers chivkyrie8217s group is the smallest of the three we8217re discussing here8221 leia added 8220adarians have a strict social tier system which means chivkyrie8217s recruited almost exclusively from secondtier people like himself the rest of the populace doesn8217t seem interested in 64257ghting against the empire8221 8220i thought everyone was supposed to give up this kind of in64257ghting when they joined the alliance8221 luke said 8220that was the agreement8221 rieekan said 8220but adarians are a stubborn people once they8217ve made up their minds it8217s almost impossible to change them8221 he shifted his gaze to leia 8220 unless whoever has the alternative idea is from a higher tier which is why we8217re sending princess leia to try to mediate8221 8220i take it you don8217t think much of chivkyrie8217s scheme8221 luke asked 8220actually we have no idea what it is8221 rieekan said 8220he refuses to discuss the matter via holonet not even with encrypted transmissions the only way we8217re going to 64257nd out about it is for you to go to shelsha sector and talk to him8221 it took luke a second to notice the pronoun han typically caught it right away 8220for us to go8221 he asked pointedly 8220yes8221 rieekan said looking him square in the eye 8220i8217d like you and skywalker to accompany the princess8221 luke felt his heartbeat pick up a little another mission for the rebellion8211and he8217d get to spend time with leia too 8220we want to keep the whole thing as lowpro64257le as possible8221 leia explained 8220that means no alliance ships and no obvious alliance personnel8221 8220no obvious alliance personnel8221 han echoed luke frowned at him what was eating han anyway 8220she just means we don8217t have any of64257cial rank or status yet8221 he explained trying to be helpful it was apparently the wrong thing to say han 64258ashed him an almost glare then turned back to rieekan 8220where exactly would we be going8221 8220as the princess said we all want to keep it lowkey chivkyrie included8221 the general said 8220he lives in makrin city the government seat on the capital world of shelkonwa but you8217ll actually be rendezvousing in an uninhabited system a few hours8217 64258ight time away8221 8220we don8217t know if the empire8217s monitoring his movements8221 leia added 8220but if so he should be able to sneak away that long without triggering any alerts8221 8220assuming you can sort out the in64257ghting without a week of discussion8221 han said 8220she8217ll sort it out8221 mon mothma said quietly con64257dent 8220are you willing to accompany her8221 8220i am8221 luke said 64257rmly daring to send a small smile in leia8217s direction his reward was an equally subtle smile in return 8220yeah i suppose8221 han said his tone far more reluctant 8220when do we leave8221 8220not for another few days8221 rieekan said 8220we need to get some details arranged 64257rst with chivkyrie and the other leaders8221 8220like what shape the conference table should be8221 han suggested leia and rieekan exchanged glances 8220we8217ll let you know the schedule as soon as we have it8221 the general said8220thank you for coming8221 8220and once again the alliance is in your debt8221 mon mothma said 8220right8221 han said standing up he strode out of the room luke watched him go wondering what exactly was going on it was apparently a universal question 8220what8217s bothering him 8221 rieekan asked 8220i don8217t know8221 luke said 8220he was like this on the way back from teardrop too8221 8220i8217ll go talk to him8221 leia volunteered standing up 8220thank you for your time mon mothma general rieekan8221 8220thank you 8221 mon mothma said gravely 8220let me know if there8217s anything i can do regarding solo8221 rieekan said 8220we need all the good people we can get8221 8220you really think there8217s a good person under all that8221 leia asked drily 8220of course there is8221 rieekan shrugged 8220somewhere8221 leia caught up with han at the falcon just as the techs were carting off the last of the teardrop equipment 8220han8221 she greeted him gravely 8220your worshipfulness8221 he countered inclining his head to her with an effort she bit down on the retort that wanted to come out why did he do that he knew she hated that kind of sarcasm or maybe that was why he did it 8220you were a little abrupt in there8221 she said instead 8220 and disrespectful8221 han8217s lip twitched 8220i didn8217t mean it that way8221 he said 8220i don8217t disrespect them well not rieekan anyway8211i8217ve seen enough bad of64257cers to know a good one when i see him8221 8220well if it wasn8217t disrespect it was a pretty good imitation8221 leia said han turned his back on her and started 64257ddling with a piece of equipment on the falcon 8217s underside 8220i just don8217t like politics8221 he said over his shoulder 8220this isn8217t about politics han8221 she said 8220this is about survival against82118221 8220of course it8217s about politics8221 he interrupted turning back to glare at her 8220it8217s always about politics one rebel leader pushes to get what he wants the other leaders try to keep him from grabbing all the credit and you and mon mothma and rieekan try to soothe everyone8217s ruf64258ed feathers that8217s not survival princess that8217s politics8221 8220is that what8217s bothering you8221 leia asked sifting rapidly through his tirade as she hunted for clues 8220you8217re not getting enough credit8221 8220of course i8217m getting enough credit8221 he said 8220don8217t you remember that shiny medal you hung around my neck8221 leia felt her cheeks burning 8220my apologies captain solo8221 she ground out with more acid than she8217d really intended 8220i8217m just trying to understand you8221 for the briefest fraction of a second she thought she saw something almost vulnerable in his eyes but the moment passed and the mask of cynical indifference dropped back into place 8220don8217t bother8221 he advised 8220even if you did you wouldn8217t believe it8221 he turned away again his hands and eyes pretending to busy themselves with random bits of the falcon 8217s equipment leia remained where she was for a few seconds until it was clear the conversation was over spinning around she strode back across the hangar 64258oor her cheeks still warm never in her life had she met a man whose strengths she so admired while at the same time wanting to strangle him with her bare hands luke was waiting just outside the hangar door 8220anything8221 he asked 8220just the usual bluster8221 leia said with a sigh 8220maybe you can get something out of him8221 luke8217s eyes 64258icked over her shoulder 8220probably better to wait until he cools down8221 8220i just wish i knew what had stirred him up in the 64257rst place8221 leia said 8220he talked about politics but i know that8217s not the whole story8221 8220meanwhile we have to get to shelsha sector8221 luke said 8220i hope general rieekan8217s got a backup plan for transport8221 8220i8217m sure he does8221 leia said 8220but we8217ve got a few days maybe we can bring han around8221 8220yeah8221 luke said doubtfully 8220maybe8221
