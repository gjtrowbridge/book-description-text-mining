 chapter 1 enlarging your vision i heard a story about a man on vacation in hawaii with his wife he was a good man who had achieved a modest measure of success but he was coasting along thinking that he8217d already reached his limits in life one day a friend was driving the couple around the island showing them the sights they stopped to admire a gorgeous house set high on a hill the property was replete with beautiful palm trees and lush green gardens in a picturesque peaceful setting with a panoramic view overlooking the ocean as the man gazed at the magnificent home he commented to his wife and friend 8220i can8217t even imagine living in a place like that8221 right there something inside him said don8217t worry you won8217t you will never live in a great place like that startled at his own thoughts he asked himself what do you mean as long as you can8217t imagine it as long as you can8217t see it then it is not going to happen for you the man correctly realized that his own thoughts and attitudes were condemning him to mediocrity he determined then and there to start believing better of himself and believing better of god it8217s the same way with us we have to conceive it on the inside before we8217re ever going to receive it on the outside if you don8217t think you can have something good then you never will the barrier is in your mind it8217s not god8217s lack of resources or your lack of talent that prevents you from prospering your own wrong thinking can keep you from god8217s best your own wrong thinking can keep you from god8217s best you too may have assumed that you8217ve already peaked that you8217ve reached your limits in life that you will never be more successful i8217ll never achieve significance do something meaningful or enjoy the good things in life that i8217ve seen others enjoy sad to say you are exactly right unless you are willing to change your thinking that8217s why the first step to living at your full potential is to enlarge your vision to live your best life now you must start looking at life through eyes of faith seeing yourself rising to new levels see your business taking off see your marriage restored see your family prospering see your dreams coming to pass you must conceive it and believe it is possible if you ever hope to experience it to conceive it you must have an image on the inside of the life you want to live on the outside this image has to become a part of you in your thoughts your conversation deep down in your subconscious mind in your actions in every part of your being envision your success from the time she was a little girl tara holland dreamed of becoming miss america in 1994 she entered the miss florida pageant and won the title of first runnerup she decided to try again the following year she entered the same contest and once again won the prize as first runnerup tara was tempted to get down and discouraged but she didn8217t do that she stayed focused on her goal she decided she needed to change her environment so she moved to kansas and in 1997 she entered the miss kansas pageant and won the title that same year she went on to be crowned miss america tara holland saw her dream come to pass in an interview after the pageant someone asked tara the secret to her success she admitted that after she had lost twice in a row at the statelevel competitions she had been tempted to give up but instead she went out and rented dozens of videos of local pageants state pageants miss teen miss universe miss world8212whatever she could find she rented hundreds of videos of various pageants and watched them over and over again as tara watched each young woman crowned a winner she pictured herself in that situation she pictured herself receiving the crown she pictured herself walking down the runway in victory time and time again she envisioned herself winning seeing herself as a winner said tara was the key to her success another reporter asked her if she was nervous walking down the runway in front of millions of people watching on television and with the announcer singing the famous miss america song tara8217s response was interesting 8220no i wasn8217t nervous at all8221 she said 8220you see i had walked down that runway thousands of times before8221 have you ever walked down that runway have you ever seen yourself accomplishing your dreams do you keep that vision of victory in front of you tara holland knew she would never be a winner until she first saw herself as a winner she had to reprogram her mind to rid herself as much as possible of the hurtful memories of losing she had to replace that vision in her mind of herself as miss runnerup she had to develop a cando attitude she saw herself stepping onto the winner8217s platform she saw herself walking down that runway in victory she created an environment of faith and success what you keep before your eyes will affect you you will produce what you8217re continually seeing in your mind if you foster an image of defeat and failure then you8217re going to live that kind of life but if you develop an image of victory success health abundance joy peace and happiness nothing on earth will be able to hold those things from you too many times we get stuck in a rut thinking we8217ve reached our limits we don8217t really stretch our faith we don8217t believe for anything bigger but god wants us to constantly be increasing to be rising to new heights he wants to increase you in his wisdom and help you to make better decisions god wants to increase you financially by giving you promotions fresh ideas and creativity the scripture says that god wants to pour out 8220his far and beyond favor82211 god wants this to be the best time of your life but if you are going to receive this favor you must enlarge your vision you can8217t go around thinking negative defeated limiting thoughts well i8217ve gone as far as my education will allow or i8217ve had this sickness for years i guess it8217s my lot in life to experience this immeasurable favor you must rid yourself of that smallminded thinking and start expecting god8217s blessings start anticipating promotion and supernatural increase you must conceive it in your heart and mind before you can receive it in other words you must make room for increase in your own thinking then god will bring those things to pass until you learn how to enlarge your vision seeing the future through your eyes of faith your own wrong thinking will prevent good things from happening in your life god will not pour fresh creative ideas and blessings into old attitudes you must conceive it in your heart and mind before you can receive it get rid of those old wineskins centuries ago wine was stored in leather wineskins rather than bottles animal skins were dried and cured until the leather could be shaped into containers to hold the wine when the wineskins were new they were soft and pliable but as they aged they often lost their elasticity they wouldn8217t give anymore they would become hardened and set and they couldn8217t expand if a person poured new wine in an old wineskin the container would burst and the wine would be lost interestingly when jesus wanted to encourage his followers to enlarge their visions he reminded them 8220you can8217t put new wine into old wineskins82212 jesus was saying that you cannot have a larger life with restricted attitudes that lesson is still relevant today we are set in our ways bound by our perspectives and stuck in our thinking god is trying to do something new but unless we8217re willing to change unless we8217re willing to expand and enlarge our vision we8217ll miss his opportunities for us the fact that you are reading this book however says that you are ready to go to a higher level you want to reach your full potential the good news is god wants to show you his incredible favor he wants to fill your life with 8220new wine8221 but are you willing to get rid of your old wineskins will you start thinking bigger will you enlarge your vision and get rid of those old negative mindsets that hold you back one fellow whose marriage was on the verge of dissolution told me 8220joel i8217ve been this way for a long time nothing good ever happens to me i don8217t see how my marriage could be restored we8217ve always had these problems8221 8220that kind of thinking will keep you from receiving the good things god wants to pour out in your life8221 i told him 8220those wrong attitudes will block the flow you must stop dwelling on negative destructive thoughts that keep you in a rut your life is not going to change until you first change your thinking8221 early in our marriage victoria and i were out walking through our neighborhood one day when we came upon a beautiful new home in the final stages of construction the doors were open so we stepped inside and looked around it was a fabulous home much prettier than any of the other homes in that community most of the other homes around us were onestory ranchstyle homes that were forty to fifty years old but this house was a large twostory home with high ceilings and oversized windows providing an appealing view of the backyard it was a lovely inspiring place when we came out of the house victoria was excited she turned around looked back at the home and said 8220joel one day we8217re going to live in a beautiful home just like that8221 at the time we were living in an extremely old house that had experienced some foundation problems preventing all of our doors on the inside from closing properly we had stretched our faith and spent everything we had just to buy that home and get into that neighborhood thinking of our bank account and my income at the time it seemed impossible to me that we8217d ever work our way up to a home like the one we had toured being the 8220great man of faith8221 that i am i said 8220victoria that home is so far beyond our reach i don8217t see how we could ever afford something like that8221 but victoria had much more faith than i did and she would not give up we stood out in front of that house for thirty minutes and debated she told me all the reasons why it could happen i told her all the reasons why i doubted she said 8220no joel i feel it deep inside it is going to happen8221 she was so filled with joy i didn8217t want to burst her bubble so i let the matter drop but victoria didn8217t over the next several months she kept speaking words of faith and victory and she finally talked me into it she convinced me that we could live in an elegant home like the one we saw i got rid of my limited thinking and i started agreeing with her i started believing that somehow some way god could bring it to pass we kept on believing it seeing it and speaking it several years later we sold our property and through another real estate deal we were able to build a house just like the one we had viewed we saw it come to pass but i don8217t believe it ever would have happened had we not first conceived it on the inside i don8217t believe it would have happened if victoria had not talked me into enlarging my vision god has so much more in store for you too start making room for it in your thinking conceive it on the inside start seeing yourself rising to a new level doing something of significance living in that home of your dreams if you want to see god8217s 8220far and beyond8221 favor then you must replace those old wineskins 8220i8217ve gone as far as my parents were able to go8221 steve said to me 8220i8217ve gone as far as anybody else in my family that8217s good enough isn8217t it8221 8220no8221 i told him 8220you don8217t have to be bound by the barriers of the past god wants you to go further than your parents i8217m sure your parents were fine hardworking people but don8217t fall into that trap of just sitting back and accepting the status quo you need to make a decision that you are not going to live an average mediocre life when you get up in the morning you need to have the attitude of i8217m going to do something great i8217m going to excel in my career i8217m going to enthusiastically serve other people i8217m going to break out of this mold and rise to new heights i tell my children all the time 8220you8217re going to go much further than daddy you have so much potential you8217re going to accomplish great things8221 i8217m not simply trying to instill pride in our children i want them to have a big vision i want them to conceive great possibilities at an early age i want them to grow up expecting god8217s favor expecting to be leaders expecting to excel in whatever they do and i know they must have it on the inside before god can ever bring it to pass on the outside one day i was driving through houston with my eightyearold son jonathan as we drove down the freeway we came upon the compaq center the sixteenthousandseat arena that was the former home of the houston rockets professional basketball team and soon to be the home of lakewood church i slowed down and pointed 8220jonathan look over there one day that8217s where you8217re going to be preaching8221 he said 8220oh no daddy when i get old enough i8217m going to preach in reliant stadium8221 reliant stadium is houston8217s seventythousandseat home of the houston texans football team i thought i like the fact that he8217s got a big dream when i first told that story at lakewood several years ago after the service a lady came up and handed jonathan a check for one hundred dollars toward that new stadium he was so excited he said 8220daddy i wish you8217d talk about me more often in your sermons8221 even if you come from an extremely successful family god still wants you to go further my own father accomplished great things in his lifetime he inspired people all over the world but i8217m not going to be satisfied to do merely what daddy did i don8217t want to simply hold my ground and maintain no i want to press on toward new heights if you look carefully you will see that god has been trying to encourage you he8217s allowed people to cross your path who are far more successful than you are who have much stronger marriages who are enjoying his favor in marvelous ways when you see or hear about other people succeeding or doing what you want to do be encouraged rather than jealous don8217t say 8220that could never happen to me i8217m not that talented i8217ll never get those kind of breaks i8217ll never have that much money8221 get rid of those old wineskins change your thinking get beyond the barriers of the past and start expecting god to do great things in your life 8220do you not perceive it8221 understand god is constantly trying to plant new seeds in your heart he8217s constantly trying to get you to conceive to give up antiquated ideas and spawn new bursts of creativity within the key is to believe to let the seed take root so it can grow what if victoria had acquiesced concerning that new house and said 8220yes joel you8217re right we8217re just young people we8217ll never afford this that house is way out of reach8221 we8217d probably still be living in our original crooked house thankfully she enlarged her vision and conceived what god was saying to her perhaps god has been speaking to you as well trying to move you to a new level he8217s put people in your life as examples to inspire you when you see their accomplishments their joys their victories something inside you should say 8220yes god i know you can bless me in a similar way i know i can have a great marriage i know i can be that happy i know i can go to those new heights8221 there is a seed within you trying to take root that8217s god trying to get you to conceive he8217s trying to fill you with so much hope and expectancy that the seed will grow and bring forth a tremendous harvest it8217s your time you may have been sick for a long time but this is your time to get well you may be bound by all kinds of addictions all kinds of bad habits but this is the time to be set free you may be struggling financially in all kinds of debt but this is the time for promotion this is your time for increase friend if you will get in agreement with god this can be the greatest time of your life this can be the time that god pours out his immeasurable far and beyond favor god says 8220behold i am doing a new thing do you not perceive it82213 notice god is always ready to do new things in our lives he8217s trying to promote us to increase us to give us more yet it8217s interesting that god asked the question 8220do you not perceive it8221 in other words are you making room for it in your own thinking are you believing for increase are you believing to excel at your job are you believing to be a more effective leader or a better parent it8217s time to enlarge your vision maybe god wants to improve your marriage restore your family or promote you at work but that seed of opportunity can8217t take root because of your doubts 8220how could my business ever take off and begin to flourish i8217ve got so many obstacles it8217s just impossible8221 god is saying to you something similar to what he told the virgin mary and others throughout scripture it8217s not going to be by your might it8217s not going to be by your power god said it8217s going to be by his spirit the power of the most high god shall come upon you and cause it to happen with god on your side you cannot possibly lose he can make a way when it looks as though there is no way he can open doors that no man can shut he can cause you to be at the right place at the right time he can supernaturally turn your life around jesus said 8220if you believe then all things are possible82214 my question to you is will you believe will you allow that seed to take root the angel told mary that she would conceive without knowing a man in other words god was saying it could happen through supernatural means it can happen without the bank loaning you the money it can happen without having the right education it can happen in spite of your past it can happen despite what the critics are telling you with god all things are possible when we got the news that the compaq center might be coming available some of my initial thoughts were similar to mary8217s how could this be how could we ever get that facility it8217s going to be too expensive the city will never let a church use that it8217s much too prominent but this time i expanded my vision i let the seed take root i conceived it on the inside i began to 8220see8221 our congregation worshiping god in the compaq center in the heart of houston over the next few months plenty of people told members of our congregation staff and me 8220it8217s never going to happen you don8217t have a chance you8217re wasting your time8221 that didn8217t matter the seed was growing on the inside when it looked impossible and we faced all kinds of challenges i just said 8220father i thank you that you are fighting our battles for us i thank you that you8217re going to show us some of that immeasurable far and beyond favor8221 the seed kept growing getting stronger and stronger sure enough three and a half years later against strong adversity god turned the situation around and he brought us out with the victory god wants to do big things in your life as well don8217t settle for a small view of god we serve the god that created the universe we8217ve got to eliminate this barelygetby mentality 8220god if you8217ll just give me a fiftycent raise i think i8217ll make it this year8221 8220god if you8217ll just help me endure this marriage 8221 8220god all i want is a little happiness8221 get rid of those old wineskins get rid of that smallminded thinking and start thinking as god thinks think big think increase think abundance think more than enough years ago a famous golfer was invited by the king of saudi arabia to play in a golf tournament he accepted the invitation and the king flew his private jet over to the united states to pick up the pro they played golf for several days and enjoyed a good time as the golfer was getting on the plane to return to the united states the king stopped him and said 8220i want to give you a gift for coming all this way and making this time so special anything you want what could i get you8221 ever the gentleman the golfer replied 8220oh please don8217t get me anything you8217ve been a gracious host i8217ve had a wonderful time i couldn8217t ask for anything more8221 the king was adamant he said 8220no i insist on giving you something so you will always remember your journey to our country8221 when the golfer realized that the king was resolute he said 8220okay fine i collect golf clubs why don8217t you give me a golf club8221 he boarded the plane and on his flight back home he couldn8217t help wondering what kind of golf club the king might give him he imagined that it might be a solid gold putter with his name engraved on it or maybe it would be a sand wedge studded with diamonds and jewels after all this would be a gift from the oilrich king of saudi arabia when the golfer got home he watched the mail and the delivery services every day to see if his golf club had come yet finally several weeks later he received a certified letter from the king of saudi arabia the us professional thought that rather strange where8217s my golf club he wondered he opened the envelope and to his surprise inside he discovered a deed to a fivehundredacre golf course in america sometimes kings think differently than you and i think and friend we serve the king of kings we serve the most high god and his dream for your life is so much bigger and better than you can even imagine it8217s time to enlarge your vision
