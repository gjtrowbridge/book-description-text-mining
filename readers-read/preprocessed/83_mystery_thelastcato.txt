 chapter one all things of great beauty from works of art to sacred objects suffer the unstoppable effects of the passage of time just as we do their life begins the moment their human creator aware or not of being in harmony with the infinite puts the finishing touches on them and surrenders them to the world over the centuries life also brings them closer to old age and death while time withers and destroys us it bestows upon them a new type of beauty that human aging could never dream of not for anything in the world would i want to see the colosseum rebuilt its walls and terraced seats in perfect condition or coat the parthenon with a gaudy paint job or give the victory of samothrace a head deeply absorbed in my work i gave those thoughts free rein as my fingertips caressed one of the rough corners of the parchment manuscript in front of me i was so wrapped up in what i was doing that i didnt hear dr william baker secretary of the archives knock at my door nor did i hear him turn the handle or open the door and look in when i finally noticed him he seemed as though he had been standing in the doorway to my office for eternity dr salina baker whispered not daring to cross the threshold reverend father ramondino has entreated me to request that you proceed to his office immediately i looked up from the manuscript and took off my glasses to get a better look at the secretary he had the same perplexed look on his oval face as i had baker was a small compact american his features reflected his family heritage and he could have easily passed for southern european he had thick tortoiseshell glasses and thin hair part blond part gray which he meticulously combed to cover as much of his shiny scalp as possible forgive me doctor i replied sharply my eyes wide can you please repeat what you just said his most reverend father ramondino wants to see you in his office right away the prefect wants to see me me i couldnt believe what i had just heard guglielmo ramondino was the executive director of the vaticans classified archives second only to his excellency monsignor oliveira i could count on one hand the number of times he had summoned me or one of my colleagues to his office baker let a slight smile come to his lips and nodded do you happen to know why he wants to see me i asked backing down no dr salina but im certain its very important still smiling he closed the door softly and disappeared by then i was in the throes of an anxiety attack sweaty palms dry mouth racing heart and trembling legs when i had a better hold of myself i got down off my stool turned off the light and cast a pained glance at the two exquisite byzantine codices that rested open on my desk with the help of those manuscripts i had dedicated the last six months to reconstructing the famous lost text of the panegyrikon written by saint nicephorus patriarch of constantinople in the ninth century and i was on the verge of completing my work i sighed resigned a deep silence surrounding me my small lab was furnished with an old wooden desk a pair of tall stools a crucifix on the wall and several shelves crammed with books it was located four floors belowground and formed part of the hypogeum the section of the classified archives very few people had access to to the rest of the world and to history this part of the vatican was invisible nonexistent even many historians and researchers would have given half their lives to consult the documents that had passed through my hands over the last eight years but the mere suggestion that someone outside the church could get permission to come here was pure entelechy a lay person never had access to the hypogeum and never would on my desk in addition to my books rested piles of notebooks and a lowwattage lamp to avoid overheating the manuscripts scalpels latex gloves and folders full of highresolution photographs of the codices most damaged pages the long swiveled arm of a magnifying glass rose twisted like a worm from the far end of my wooden workbench hanging from that swayed a large red cardboard hand with stars glued all over it that hand was a memento from fiveyearold isabellas last birthday party of the twentyfive offspring contributed to the lords flock by six of my eight brothers and sisters she was my favorite my lips drew up a smile as i remembered charming isabella aunt ottavia aunt ottavia let me spank you with this red hand the prefect my god the prefect was waiting for me and there i stood frozen like a statue thinking about isabella i tore off my lab coat and hung it on a hook on the wall i grabbed my id a big c was stamped next to a terrible picture of me went out into the hallway and locked the door to the lab my staff worked at a row of desks that extended all the way to the elevator doors some fifty meters on the other side of the reinforced concrete wall office workers filed and refiled hundreds and thousands of records pertaining to the church its history its diplomatic negotiations and its activities from the second century to the present more than twentyfive kilometers of bookshelves hinted at the massive amount of preserved documents belonging to the vaticans classified archives officially the archives contained only documents from the last eight centuries however documents from a thousand years before were also under its protection and were kept in highsecurity files found only on the third and fourth underground floors originally housed in parishes monasteries cathedrals or
