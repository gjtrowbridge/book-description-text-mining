 when i think back on everything terrible that happened that autumn151the murders the grim discovery i made the danger i found myself in151i realize i probably could have avoided all of it if my love life hadnt been so sucky or let me rephrase that nonexistent late in the summer id been kicked to the curb by a guy i was fairly gaga over and though my heart no longer felt as raw as a rug burn my misery had morphed into a sour manrepellent mood it was as if i had a sign over my head that said step any closer and im gonna bitchslap you so when i was invited to spend an early fall weekend free of charge at the cedar inn and spa in warren massachusetts i grabbed the chance trust me i wasnt expecting to meet anyone there151except maybe a few rich women in pastel sweat suits and fanny packs who thought having their bodies slathered in shea butter would miraculously vaporize their cellulite i should also admit that ive generally found spa stuff pretty goofy i once had a complimentary pruneandpumpkin facial and when it was over i kept thinking that i should be stationed on a sideboard between a roast turkey and cornbread stuffing but i do go nuts for a good massage and i was hoping that a few of those and a change of scenery would improve my mood as well as jumpstart my heart unfortunately soon after i arrived at the inn all hell broke loose i pulled into warren just before seven on friday night a reasonable arrival time but three damn hours later than id originally planned a combination of things had thrown my schedule into a tizzy im a freelance journalist specializing in humaninterest and crime stories and an interview that i was scheduled to do with a psychologist for an article on mass hysteria got pushed from morning to midafternoon i would have liked to just blow it off entirely but the piece was due at the end of the following week and i was feeling under the gun i didnt hit the road until threethirty guaranteeing that id have a good chance of getting caught in a rushhour mess somewhere between manhattan and massachusetts151and i did in addition i was undone by a smoldering car fire on the southbound side of the new york state thruway which caused people on my side to practically crawl by on their haunches so they could get a better look you would have thought the front half of the titanic had been dredged and deposited along the side of the road if id arrived on schedule i would have been welcomed by the owner of the inn danielle aka danny hubner she was the one treating me to an allexpensespaid weekend an old college friend of my mothers danny had been pleading for me to visit the inn since shed opened it three or four years ago but id always been too crazed with work151or too caught up in the stages of grief that followed the demise two years ago of my flash fire of a marriage heartache healing and manic horniness this fall because of my snarky mood id finally said yes it would be great i figured to not only be pampered 247 but also to spend a nice chunk of time with danny she was really my friend too and she had a slightly offbeat personality that i found absolutely refreshing i got the sense my visit would also prove beneficial to her my mother had called right before she flew to athens for a mediterranean cruise to say that danny had seemed in a bit of a slump lately but she didnt know why my mother was worried she might be having troubles with her second husband george whom id yet to meet151and whom my mother didnt seem wild about since i arrived so late id missed danny according to the desk clerk shed driven into town on business she could no longer put off but shed left word that she would check in with me later i was given a brief tour before being shown to my room the inn a rambling clapboard building probably erected in the mid1800s was really quite smashing even more so than in the pictures id seen instead of dripping with the cutesy country charm that you so often find at a restored inn the decor was elegant pared down151lots of beige and cream tones and brownandwhitecheck fabric and there wasnt a whirligig weather vane or wooden swan in sight since i was late i figured id blown any chance of getting a treatment that night but my guide explained that danny had arranged for me to be squeezed in for a massage at eight151before a late dinner the inns spa which also operated as a day spa for the area stayed open until ten i had about fifteen minutes to catch my breath before the massage my room was maximum charming a suite actually with a small living area it also sported checks but in red and white and paired with several quirky print fabrics i unpacked the clothes most likely to wrinkle and hung them in the closet im a contributing writer for gloss magazine and i read in a recent issue that you should roll your clothes in tissue paper before packing them in order to prevent wrinkles but id no sooner take the time to do that than i would to iron my underpants next i took a very quick shower letting the spray of hot water do a number on muscles achy from a long car ride i dried myself off with a thick egyptiancotton towel thanks to a towel warmer it was as toasty as a baked potato as i buffed my body with it i noticed a small earthenware jar on the bathroom countertop it was filled to the brim with ambercolored bath salts and a little tag announced their availability for sale in the spa they were a blend of sandalwood and sweet orange aromatics with a hint of frankincense prepared the tag said so i could surrender to a state of total enchantment and emerge with a primitive power god just what i needed was it actually suggesting i could get both in the same weekend i glanced up into the mirror above the sink im five six with short brownish blond hair and blue eyes and im considered pretty in a slightly sporty way but there was no denying that at this moment in time i looked weary even burnedout it was going to take a helluva lot of bath salts to leave me feeling enchanted and empowered i arrived downstairs at the spa with just a few minutes to spare it was actually a large addition to the inn abutting the eastern edge of the building the decor was asian inspired beige walls cracked stone floors bamboo plants in large puttycolored pots and hallways lined with sheer beige curtains that poofed outward from the breeze that you created walking by them it was very different from the decor of the inn but because they both featured such muted tones it all seemed to work together i undressed in a spacious dressing area and then waited for ten minutes in the socalled relaxation room haunting asian music played in the background water gurgled over stones in a small fountain and the scent of green tea wafted from two flickering candles i tried to let go and relish it but i felt a little silly it was as if id somehow stumbled into a scene from crouching tiger hidden dragon fortunately it was only a few minutes before i was led to a treatment room i could barely wait for my massage to start for the chance to have those sore muscles unknotted my only concern was that it had been so long since id had any physical contact with another member of my species that i might begin to whimper at the first touch151like a poor little pound puppy unfortunately on a scale of one to ten the massage was no more than a seven my therapist a redhaired woman in her thirties was skilled enough and had plenty of strength in her hands but she seemed distracted pausing at odd moments as she worked it was enough to make me wonder if i had something weird happening on my butt151like a humongous boil151that was forcing her to stop and gape in horror i was almost relieved when i was finally back in my suite and could totally veg after ordering a club sandwich and a glass of merlot from room service i unpacked most of the rest of the stuff from my bag sticking my underwear and shirts in a dresser in the early days that id traveled i used to wonder who actually used hotel dressers but lately at the ripe old age of thirtythree id come to discover that i prefer not having to forage through my suitcase each time i get dressed my food arrived within twenty minutes and ravenous i devoured it then after opening the window a crack i undressed and turned back the thick white duvet on the bed i was looking forward to reading between sheets that felt as if they exceeded a threehundredthread count as i lay between said silky sheets though i could feel my mind itching to go places it shouldnt in other words it was dying to ruminate about my most recent love trouble his name was jack herlihy and he was a thirtyfiveyearold professor of psychology from washington dc whom id met in may after hed come up to teach a summer course in new york at the time jack had come across like a breath of fresh air compared to most of the guys id been meeting he was great looking nice without being a wuss and an amazing listener well he was a shrink and he managed to be all of these things without ever showing up like some new york men with too much product in his hair he seemed like a straight shooter not the kind of guy who promises to call the next day but doesnt for weeks giving you reason to believe that he calculates his time in dog years jack didnt like games151or at least thats what i assumed before he started playing them most of my jack ruminations generally involved trying to figure out how id blown things admittedly our romance had gotten off to a slow start but hed seemed okay with the pace and it was certainly fine with me id been fairly skittish since my exhusband151the attorneyatlaw and gambleratlarge151had fled the scene jack and i had some fun nights in the village he was hoping to eventually relocate to new york one glorious day on the beach on fire island and a night of halfnaked groping in his apartment during which i explained i wanted to wait a little longer for the fullfrontal variety then in the beginning of july jack announced that his younger sister had meningitis and he was going to be going home to pittsburgh each weekend to help his family since his life was about to become insane he wanted to put our relationship on hold for the next few weeks151until he and his family were through the worst i promised to be there when his life returned to normal wed stayed in phone contact through july and the first week of august and then suddenly i stopped hearing from him i told myself to be patient that he was caught up in the crisis but after several weeks had gone by and he was still incommunicado i started to panic since i didnt have any reason to believe hed entered the federal witness protection program i suspected that id been given the boot but wait things get worse just before labor day as i was cruising the village in search of fall shoes i spotted him from a distance with a couple of cute female student types151he seemed talky flirtatious mister notafriggincareintheworld as id ducked on wobbly legs into a store to avoid being seen it was finally clear that it was over the only question left in my mind was why had he not been that interested in me to begin with and his sisters illness had become a good excuse to put distance between us had he met someone else in the weeks wed been apart had my request to take the sexual part of the relationship slowly discouraged him despite the fact that he had sounded okay with it just as i was about to travel this tiresome ground in my mind for the millionth time the phone rang bailey its danny i didnt wake you did i as she spoke i could see her in my minds eye she was in her early sixties pretty or rather handsome id say with blondish gray hair lightly curled and she was tiny 151only about five feet tall and as slim as a candlewick no no im just lying in bed with a book i said danny your inn is absolutely gorgeous youve done an amazing job with it thank you so much dearest how has your evening been well for the last twenty minutes id been tapping a freshly scabbed emotional bruise seeing if i could make myself squeal151but i spared her that sordid detail terrific i had a lovely massage and then a light dinner up here in my room151or should i say my suite fit for a princess who was your massage therapist do you recall a woman redhead name started with a p i think piper she has wonderful hands dont you think yes definitely i wasnt going to get piper in any kind of trouble by saying her heart hadnt been totally into her work tonight by the way ive set up a meeting for you and josh the spa manager at four tomorrow151if thats still okay with you i write a few travel articles each year151its a free way to see the world and also a nice break from the crime grind151and danny was hoping that while i was ensconced at the inn i could provide some ideas on how to better pitch her place to editors and travel writers of course i said but when do i get to see you how about breakfast together tomorrow morning danny asked would nine work for you absolutely though i still may be in a stupor from my massage she laughed lightly like someone jangling her keys well you know what i always say151too much of a good thing is wonderful just wait till you have some of the other treatments ive got booked for you have you ever had a massage with hot stones before no151but im game for anything as long as it doesnt involve colonics oh bailey you always make me laugh she said well im going to turn in now because my head is throbbing for some reason im staying here at the inn tonight by the way in case you need to reach me do you do that to see things from the guests perspective partly but also george is out of town and i hate staying alone our house isnt far from here but its very secluded shall we meet in the lobby then see you then i cant wait and i meant it i felt a tremendous debt to danny she had been so good to me when my father died the year i was twelve taking me on all sorts of little adventures and day trips at a time when my mother was struggling so much that it was hard for her to comfort me danny must have sensed early on my fascination for the macabre because one of our excursions had been to salem to learn more about the witch trials my mother had looked slightly agog at both of us when shed learned where wed ended up that day but it had been pure heaven for me my family eventually lost touch with danny during a period when shed lived out west in a bad marriage but after she moved back to massachusetts with a new husband to open the inn she and my mother had reconnected though i was only now paying a visit to the inn danny and i had spoken a few times on the phone and id had lunch with her once in new york when shed come to the city on business the call from danny had managed to take my mind off jack and i picked up the book id taken into bed with me it was of all things a decorating book lately id been feeling in desperate need of a change in my greenwich village apartment after my divorce id jettisoned all the modern stuff my ex had encouraged us to buy and introduced a sante fe feeling151with the help of cinnamoncolored walls and some cheap baskets but it was suddenly boring me adding to my burnedout feeling last week id asked the gloss decorating editor for some guidance and had been forced to watch him recoil in horror as i described my place to him you would have thought id announced id just installed walltowall shag carpet sante fe is totally stupid to do east of the mississippi hed said the light is all wrong for it besides who wants to see another turquoise coyote with a kerchief around its neck hed suggested i go minimal and had pulled a book from his shelf for me to consult id gone through four or five chapters covering everything from the value of white space to the pure evil of tchotchkes when i instinctively glanced at my wrist to check the time my watch wasnt there i felt a tiny swell of panic it had been my fathers watch an old stainlesssteel rolex id started wearing shortly after he died my mind raced trying to recall where id left it it had been on my wrist during the drive to massachusetts because i recalled checking it since it was waterproof i never took it off when i showered the massage rather than leave it in the locker id worn it into the treatment room and placed it on a small stool in the corner i would never fall asleep if i didnt retrieve it i dialed the spa number which was listed on a panel on the phone as i counted the rings i leaned out of bed and glanced at the digital clock on the bedside table 1025 i wasnt surprised when no one picked up plan b id just head down there there might still be someone onsite cleaning up and not bothering to answer the phone i threw off the covers and dressed in the same clothes id worn earlier my room was on the second floor of the inn not far from a back staircase that ended near a side entrance to the spa hurrying along the corridor i was surprised at how deadly quiet it was151no murmur of voices no hum of tvs and definitely no headboard banging guests here obviously preferred getting loofahed to getting laid the door to the spa was solid glass and i could look directly into the small reception area that was reserved for the use of the inns guests it was dark except for a backlight in a case of spa products i tapped on the door and then tried to open it no luck as i turned away though i thought i heard a sound something thudlike that i couldnt identify from deep within the spa it sounded as if someone might still be there but i was going to have to try the main reception area which could be reached only from the outside walking along the groundfloor corridor i found an emergency exit and let myself out i was on the edge of the parking lot dark except for a few perimeter security lights and a big puddle of moonlight i headed around the edge of the building toward the main entrance of the spa i was surprised at how cool the night was the early october temperature had hovered around seventy earlier in the day almost balmy but it had dropped at least twenty degrees there was a stiff choppy wind making the tree branches shake this was one of those nights that told you that if youd been hoping the summery weather would last forever you were a fool before i even reached the door of the spa i could see id wasted my time there was a narrow window alongside each side of the front door and it was dark inside there were no cars at this end not a soul in sight it was totally silent too except for the wind and the faint yawning of cars speeding along a faroff highway i felt nervous all of a sudden standing out there in the darkness all by myself i quickly broke into a jog and crossed the distance of the parking lot to the front of the inn there were about twenty cars at this end obviously belonging to guests the front door was open and i walked into the reception area where a girl of no more than twentyfive was sitting at the front desk staring at a terminal screen like my massage therapist she had bright red hair held off her face with a tiny blue clip without giving her time to inquire if she could help me i explained the situation to her and asked if she could open up the spa im sorry im not allowed to let anyone into the spa she said but they open at seven i can leave a note under the door asking them to look for your watch as soon as they get in who was your therapist piper oh im sure she saw it and put it up someplace theres no need to worry youre probably right but i cant help it i told her the watch has incredible sentimental value to me who can let me in well danielle could but151 i dont want to wake her is there someone else she thought for a second her blue eyes raised to the ceiling well the manager had the day off but i guess i could call piper shes an assistant manager and shes got a key but then shed have to drive all the way back here no she wouldnt151she lives right here theres a building out back where some of the staff stay i dont think shed mind coming over natalie151thats what it said on her nametag151glanced at a phone sheet on her desk and placed the call a machine obviously picked up after five or six rings because she left a message detailing what had happened and asking piper to call she must have gone into town for dinner she said setting the phone back down i doubt shell be gone long theres another assistant manager anna she let her voice trail off without asking if i wanted to track down her obviously hoping i wasnt going to push the issue even more i can wait till piper gets back i said once back in my room i alternated between reading my book and fretting i had just glanced at the digital clock for about the four hundredth time1511113151when the phone rang it was piper hi miss weggins natalie said you left your watch in the treatment room yeah im pretty sure its on the little stool in the corner you didnt see it no but then i dont recall looking over there she hesitated a second why dont i run over and check151im just behind the inn there was something about her tone151resigned politeness151that told me she was doing it not out of any inborn generosity but because the inn encouraged staff to bend over backward for the guests god i hate to put you out but id die if something happened to that watch should i meet you down there id be happy to drop it off in your room151but actually maybe its best for you to show me exactly where you think you left it she said we should meet by the inn entrance to the spa id kept my clothes on so it took me less than two minutes to get down there i had a fiveminute wait though before piper strode down the corridor from the front of the inn it was funny how different she looked out of uniform instead of a beige tshirt and baggy beige pants she was wearing jeans and a longsleeved green jersey shirt lowcut with a ruffle her shoulderlength red hair which had been tied back earlier was spread around her shoulders like a brush fire she was courteous enough when she greeted me but it seemed like that kind of phony politeness shed displayed on the phone she already had her keys out and she unlocked the door lifting the handle slightly as she pulled it forward obviously familiar with the doors quirkiness she flipped on a light in the reception area and i followed her down one of the corridors the scent of green tea still hung in the air and something else maybe jasmine the only sound was our footsteps on the stone floor it felt kind of creepy to be here alone after hours i wouldnt have been able to recall which room wed been in but she seemed sure of it as we reached the open doorway she froze suddenly like a gazelle picking up the scent of something possibly predatory what is it i asked theres a light on piper said in a hushed tone using her chin to point down the hall ahead of us i glanced in that direction and saw a chink of light coming from beneath a doorway is someone here i asked my voice as quiet as hers no its just funny i swear i turned off the light and left the door open why dont you look for your watch and ill check she flicked on the light for me and as she walked off down the hall i made a beeline for the stool i mouthed a big thank you to the gods when i spotted the rolex lying there all by its lonesome as i slid it onto my wrist i heard a scream with my heart thumping i stumbled out into the hall piper was standing paralyzed in the doorway of the room down the corridor half in the room half out whats the matter i yelled she turned to me with a look of absolute horror on her face unable to form even a single word i rushed down the hall pushing past her into the room it was another massage room though slightly larger than the one id been in the lights were dim and at first nothing seemed amiss then my eyes fell to the floor lying on the stone floor absolutely still was a body or at least what i thought must be a body every inch of it was wrapped up in some kind of silver paper i could see the outlines of the limbs and the torso and the head and the outline too of the nose protruding from the face it looked like some kind of mummy like some horrible mummy from outer space
