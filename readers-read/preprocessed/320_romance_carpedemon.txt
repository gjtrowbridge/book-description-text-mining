 chapter one my name is kate connor and i used to be a demon hunter ive often thought that would be a great pickup line at parties but with a teenager a toddler and a husband im hardly burning up the party circuit and of course the whole demon hunting thing is one great big gargantuan secret no one knows not my kids not my husband and certainly not folks at these imaginary parties where im regaling sumptuous hunks with tales from my demonslaying vampirehunting zombiekilling days back in the day i was pretty cool now im a glorified chauffeur for pep squad practice and gymboree play dates less sex appeal maybe but i gotta admit i love it i wouldnt trade my family for anything and after fourteen years of doing the mommy thing my demon hunting skills arent exactly sharp all of which explains why i didnt immediately locate and terminate the demon wandering the pet food aisle of the san diablo walmart instead when i caught a whiff of that telltale stench i naturally assumed it emanated exclusively from the bottom of a particularly cranky twoyearold my twoyearold to be exact quotmom he did it again what are you feeding himquot that from alison my particularly cranky fourteenyear old she at least didnt stink quotentrails and goat turdsquot i said absently i sniffed the air again surely that was only timmy i was smelling quotmoomquot she managed to make the word two syllables quotyou dont have to be grossquot quotsorryquot i concentrated on my kids pushing my suspicions firmly out of my mind i was being silly san diablo had been demon free for years thats why i lived here after all besides the comings and goings of demons werent my problem any more nowadays my problems leaned more toward the domestic rather than the demonic grocery shopping budgeting carpooling mending cleaning cooking parenting and a thousand other quotingsquot all the basic stuff that completely holds a family together and is taken entirely for granted by every person on the planet who doesnt happen to be a wife and stay at home mom and two points to you if you caught that little bit of vitriol ill admit to having a few issues about the whole topic but dammit i work hard and believe me im no stranger to hard work it was never easy say cleaning out an entire nest of evil bloodthirsty preternatural creatures with only a few wooden stakes some holy water and a can of diet coke but i always managed and it was a hell of a lot easier than getting a teenager a husband and a toddler up and moving in the morning now thats a challenge while timmy fussed and whined i swung the shopping cart around aiming for the back of the store and a diaper changing station it would have been a refined fluid motion if timmy hadnt taken the opportunity to reach out with those chubby little hands his fingers collided with a stack of fancy feast cans and everything started wobbling i let out one of those startled little quotohquot sounds totally pointless and entirely ineffectual there was a time when my reflexes were so sharp so perfectly attuned that i probably could have caught every one of those cans before they hit the ground but that katie wasnt with me in walmart and i watched helpless as the cans clattered to the ground another fine mess alison had jumped back as the cans fell and she looked with dismay at the pile as for the culprit he was suddenly in a fabulous mood clapping wildly and screaming quotbig noise big noisequot while eyeing the remaining stacks greedily i inched the cart further away from the shelves quotallie do you mind i need to go change himquot she gave me one of those putupon looks that are genetically coded to appear as soon as a girl hits her teens quottake your pickquot i said using my most reasonable mother voice quotclean up the cat food or clean up your brotherquot quotill pick up the cansquot she said in a tone that perfectly matched her expression i took a deep breath and reminded myself that she was fourteen raging hormones those difficult adolescent years more difficult i imagined for me than for her quotwhy dont i meet you in the music aisle pick out a new cd and well add it to the pilequot her face lit up quotreallyquot quotsure why notquot yes yes dont even say it i know why not setting a bad precedent not defining limits blah blah blah throw all that psycho mumbo jumbo at me when youre wandering walmart with two kids and a list of errands as long as your arm if i can buy a days worth of cooperation for 1499 then thats a deal im jumping all over ill worry about the consequences in therapy thank you very much i caught another whiff of nastiness right before we hit the restrooms out of habit i looked around a feeble old man squinted at me from over the walmart sunday insert but other than him there was nobody around but me and timmy quotpuquot timmy said then flashed a toothy grin i smiled as i wrangled the stroller into the ladies room quotpuquot was his newest favorite word followed in close second by quotoh manquot the quotoh manquot i can blame on nickelodeon and dora the explorer for the other i lay exclusive blame on my husband who has never been keen on changing dirty diapers and has managed im convinced over the short term of timmys life to give the kid a complete and utter complex about bowel movements quotyoure puquot i said hoisting him onto the little dropdown changing table quotbut not for long well clean you up powder that bottom and slap on a new diaper youre gonna come out smelling like a rose kidquot quotlike a rosequot he mimicked reaching for my earrings while i held him down and stripped him after a million wipes and one fresh diaper timmy was back in the stroller we fetched allie away from a display of newly released cds and she came more or less willingly a natalie imbruglia cd clutched in her hand ten minutes and eightyseven dollars later i was strapping timmy into his car seat while allie loaded our bags into the minivan as i was maneuvering through the parking lot i caught one more glimpse of the old man from customer service he was standing at the front of the store between the coke machines and the plastic kiddie pools just staring out toward me i pulled over my plan was to pop out say a word or two to him take a good long whiff of his breath and then be on my way i had my door half open when music started blasting from all six of the odysseys speakers at something close to one hundred decibels i jumped whipping around to face allie who was already fumbling for the volume control and muttering quotsorry sorryquot i pushed the power button which ended the natalie inbruglia surround sound serenade but did nothing about timmy who was now bawling his eyes out probably from the pain associated with burst eardrums i shot allie a stern look unfastened my seatbelt and climbed into the backseat all the while trying to make happy sounds that would calm my kid quotim sorry momquot allie said to her credit she sounded sincere quoti didnt know the volume was up that highquot she maneuvered into the backseat on the other side of timmy and started playing peekaboo with boo bear a bedraggled blue bear thats been timmys constant companion since he was five months old at first timmy ignored her but after a while he joined in and i felt a little surge of pride for my daughter quotgood for youquot i said she shrugged and kissed her brothers forehead i remembered the old man and reached for the door but as i looked out at the sidewalk i saw that he was gone quotwhats wrongquot allie asked i hadnt realized i was frowning so i forced a smile and concentrated on erasing the worry lines from my forehead quotnothingquot i said and then since that was the truth i repeated myself quotnothing at allquot for the next three hours we bounced from store to store as i went down my list for the day bulk goods at walmart check shoes for timmy at payless check happy meal for timmy to ward off crankiness check new shoes for allie from dsw check new ties for stuart from tj maxx check by the time we hit the grocery store the happy meal had worn off both timmy and allie were cranky and i wasnt far behind mostly though i was distracted that old man was still on my mind and i was irritated with myself for not letting the whole thing drop but something about him bugged me as i pushed the shopping cart down the dairy aisle i told myself i was being paranoid for one thing demons tend not to infect the old or feeble makes sense when you think about it if youre going to suddenly become corporeal you might as well shoot for young strong and virile for another im pretty sure thered been no demon stench just a particularly pungent toddler diaper of course that didnt necessarily rule out demon proximity all the demons id ever run across tended to pop breath mints like candy and one even owned the majority share of stock in a mouthwash manufacturer even so common sense told me there was no demon mostly though i needed to drop the subject because it simply wasnt my problem anymore i may have been a level four demon hunter once upon a time but that time was fifteen years ago i was retired now out of the loop even more i was out of practice i turned down the cookie and chips aisle careful not to let timmy see as i tossed two boxes of teddy grahams into the cart behind me allie lingered in front of the breakfast cereal and i could practically see her mind debating between the uberhealthy kashi and her favorite lucky charms i tried to focus on my grocery list were we really out of all bran but my brain kept coming back to the old man surely i was just being paranoid i mean why would a demon willingly come to san diablo anyway the california coastal town was built on a hillside its crisscross of streets leading up to the cathedral that perched at the top of the cliffs a focal point for the entire town in addition to being stunningly beautiful the cathedral was famous for its holy relics and it drew both tourists and pilgrims the devout came to san diablo for the same reason the demons stayed awaythe cathedral was holy ground evil simply wasnt welcome there that was also the primary reason eric and i had retired in san diablo ocean views the fabulous california weather and absolutely no demons or other nasties to ruin our good time san diablo was a great place to have kids friends and the normal life he and i had both craved even now i thank god that we had ten good years together quotmomquot allie squeezed my free hand and i realized id been holding a freezer door open staring blankly at a collection of frozen pizzas quotyou okayquot from the way her nose crinkled i knew she suspected i was thinking about her dad quotfinequot i lied blinking furiously quoti was trying to decide between pepperoni or sausage for dinner tonight and then i got sidetracked thinking about making my own pizza doughquot quotthe last time you tried that you got dough stuck on the light fixture and stuart had to climb up and dig it outquot quotthanks for reminding mequot but it had worked wed both moved past our melancholy eric had died just after allies ninth birthday and although she and stuart got along famously i knew she missed her dad as much as i did we talked about it on occasion sometimes remembering the funny times and sometimes like when we visited the cemetery the memories were filled with tears but now wasnt the time for either and we both knew it i squeezed her hand back my girl was growing up already she was looking out for me and it was sweet and heartbreaking all at the same time quotwhat do you thinkquot i asked quotpepperoniquot quotstuart likes sausage betterquot she said quotwell get bothquot i said knowing allies distaste for sausage pizza quotwant to rent a movie on the way home well have to look fast so the food doesnt spoil but surely theres something weve been wanting to seequot her eyes lit up quotwe could do a harry potter marathonquot i stifled a grimace quotwhy not its been at least a month since our last hp marathonquot she rolled her eyes then retrieved timmys sippy cup and adjusted boo bear i knew i was stuck my cell phone rang i checked the caller id then leaned against the grocery cart as i answered quothey honquot quotim having the day from hellquot stuart said which was a poor choice of words considering that got me thinking about demons all over again quotand im afraid im going to ruin your day tooquot quoti can hardly waitquot quotany chance you were planning something fabulous for dinner enough to serve eight with cocktails before and some fancy dessert afterquot quotfrozen pizza and harry potterquot i said certain i knew where this was going to end up quotahquot stuart said in the background i could hear the eraser end of his pencil tapping against his desktop beside me allie pretended to bang her head against the glass freezer door quotwell that would serve eightquot he said quotbut it may not have quite the cachet i was hoping forquot quotits importantquot quotclark thinks it isquot clark curtis was san diablos lame duck county attorney and he favored my husband to step into his shoes right now stuart had a low political profile working for peanuts as an assistant county attorney in the real estate division stuart was months away from formally announcing but if he wanted to have any hope of winning the election he needed to start playing the political game shaking hands currying favors and begging campaign contributions although a little nervous he was excited about the campaign and flattered by clarks support as for me the thought of being a politicians wife was more than a little unnerving quota house full of attorneysquot i said trying to think what the heck i could feed them or better yet if there was anyway to get out of this allie sank down to the floor her back against the freezer her forehead on her knees quotand judgesquot quotoh greatquot this was the part about domesticity that i didnt enjoy entertaining just isnt my thing i hated it actually always had always would but my husband the aspiring politician loved me anyway imagine that quoti tell you what ill have joan call some caterers you dont have to do anything except be home by six to meet them folks are coming at seven and ill be sure to be there by sixthirty to give you a handquot now see thats why i love him but i couldnt accept guilt welled in my stomach just from the mere suggestion this was the man i loved after all and i couldnt be bothered to pull together a small dinner party what kind of a heartless wench was i quothow about rigatoniquot i asked wondering which was worse heartless wench or guilty sucker quotand a spinach salad and i can pick up some appetizers and the stuff for my apple tartquot that pretty much exhausted my guestworthy repertoire and stuart knew it quotsounds perfectquot he said quotbut are you sure its already fourquot quotim surequot i said not sure at all but it was his career not mine that was riding on my culinary talents quotyoure the bestquot he said quotlet me talk to alliequot i passed the phone to my daughter who was doing a good impression of someone so chronically depressed she was in need of hospitalization she lifted a weary hand took the phone and pressed it to her ear quotyeahquot while they talked i focused my attention on timmy who was being remarkably good quotnosequot he said when i pointed to my nose quotearquot i pointed to my other ear quotmore earquot the kid was literal that was for sure i leaned in close and gave him big wet sloppy kisses on his neck while he giggled and kicked with my head cocked to the side like that i caught a glimpse of allie who no longer looked morose if anything she looked supremely pleased with herself i wondered what she and stuart were scheming and suspected it was going to involve me carpooling a load of teenage girls to the mall quotwhatquot i asked as allie hung up quotstuart said it was okay with him if i spent the night at mindys can i pleasequot i ran my fingers through my hair and tried not to fantasize about killing my husband the reasonable side of me screamed that he was only trying to help the annoyed side of me retorted that hed just sent my help packing and i now had to clean the house cook dinner and keep timmy entertained all on my own quotpleeeeeezequot quotfine sure great ideaquot i started pushing the cart toward the dairy aisle while timmy babbled something entirely unintelligible quotyou can get your stuff and head to mindys as soon as we get homequot she did a little hopskip number then threw her arms around my neck quotthanks mom youre the bestquot quotmmmm remember this the next time youre groundedquot she pointed at her chest her face ultrainnocent quotme in trouble i think you have me confused with some other daughterquot i tried to scowl but didnt quite manage it and she knew shed won me over well what the heck i was a woman of the new millennium id staked vampires defeated demons and incapacitated incubi how hard could a lastminute dinner party be
