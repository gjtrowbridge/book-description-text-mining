 its graduation daynbsp ive got a million things to donbsp none of which includes going to the actual ceremonynbsp i dont think too much of that kind of stuffnbspnbspnbsp i look over at the shrinkwrapped square enshrining the cap and gown that ive abandoned on a side tablenbsp a total bus station momentnbspnbsp kitty twists the lollipop in her mouth getting blue sugar syrup all over her fingers a goldfish swims in the plastic bag shes clutching in her other handnbsp yeahnbsp but im kind of sorry im missing it i shrugnbsp youre really not going she asks interviews more important kittys eyes narrownbsp you know i think you scheduled it on graduation day on purpose did not i lienbsp they asked me to uhhuh like i said graduation day is nothing but a bus station momentnbsp all that waiting it finally gets here you get on for the ride and then youre unceremoniously booted out of your seat and replaced by someone else graduation is maybe the kind of bus you dont want to miss i couldnt care less bullshit im seriousnbsp i laughnbsp college was only incrementally less painful than high school kitty nodsnbsp she pulls the lollipop stick out of her mouth and it comes out cleannbsp she crams the used stick in her cargo pocketnbsp well i guess this is it i guess so i say frowning hard and trying not to crynbsp youre really not going to graduation she asks again nah me neithernbsp i knownbsp youve got a plane to catch we stand there repeating ourselves because we dont want to accept that everythings about to changenbsp kitty lunges forward for a hug the bagged goldfish swinging wildly in her grip water dripping off her wrist down my necknbsp as fast as she lunged forward she pulls backnbsp we hate goodbyesnbsp she thrusts the plastic bag at menbsp youll remember to feed him i take the bag with a sighnbsp ill remembernbsp hell be here when you get back i dont know kitty says skepticallynbsp hes pretty old i hold up the bag and we watch the goldfish togethernbsp then we look at each othernbspnbspnbsp well kitty says i know you wont try to kill him on purpose we laugh to keep things from getting teary but of course they get teary anywaynbsp kitty picks up her last suitcase and opens the doornbsp a sharp noise echoes down the inner staircase and we both jumpnbsp she sticks her head out and looks both waysnbsp what was that i ask she shrugs then looks back over her shoulder at menbsp i echo kittys wordsnbsp we hate goodbyes kittys black pigtails bob as she starts lugging her suitcase down the stairs waving her hand behind her in farewellnbsp she stops and turns and calls up to menbsp just remember roxanne it cant always be about tomorrownbsp sometimes its about right fucking now i shut the door and stand there for a moment listening to the clomp of kittys combat boots on the stairsnbsp they become less clompy with every step until theres nothing left sirens blare outsidenbsp i hold the goldfish bag up to eye levelnbsp itll be fine i say then look around for something to put him innbsp the phone rings the doorbell rings i look between the phone and the door and i pick one chapter 1 we had everything before us we had nothing before us nbspid read that once or something like it but i couldnt help thinking it had to be one or the othernbsp alone in the middle of the street staring into darkness i wondered which was worse and forced myself to keep walkingnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp i was on the way to the 7elevennbsp it was two oclock in the morningnbsp i was almost positive there wouldnt be anyone in there but menbsp so i could just go straight in and buy my item and then id turn around and come straight backnbsp what could possibly happennbsp nothingnbsp absolutely nothing was going to happen so there was absolutely no point in panickingnbsp im not going to panicnot going to panicnot going i tried staring at my feet as i walked trying to focus on anything at all that wouldnt freak me the hell outnbsp the heels of my shoes struck the pavement in the sound of confidence that the rest of me just didnt feel which was silly because when i got to the store there would be someone i knew someone familiarnbsp naveednbsp so it would be finenbsp naveed worked what seemed to be around the clock at the 7eleven near my placenbsp two blocks down and two blocks over a fiveminute walknbsp i realized that a lot of crime could take place in five minutes but i liked to think that my neighborhood was far enough north of the really sketchy part of town to avoid iteven if the 7eleven itself was really the line of demarcationnbsp we had lots of quaint victorian facades in the area only some of which were still crumbling and we had fairly nice neighbors most of whom tried to grow gardensnbsp we were still close enough to the bay to hear the comforting low of foghorns at night even if we couldnt see the waternbsp we had hills near enough to climb and look over to see a grand city view even if we werent living in itnbsp in short my neighborhood wasnt the worst and it wasnt the bestnbsp it just wasnbsp and we had lots of things i could think about to make myself feel like i wasnt being a complete idiot by coming out here like this besides i made a point of walking in the middle of the street and it wasnt like i was loitering or anything all i wanted was to get there get my thing and get home head down i jammed my hands deeper into my hoodie pockets and powered through the crisp air moving from dark to light and back again as i passed beneath spotlights from the occasional streetlampnbsp at the halfway point between my house and the convenience store the panic i was trying so hard to keep at bay started to winnbsp once more i stopped in the middle of the street and tried to work it out in that same logical rational mannernbspnbspnbsp what are you doing roxanne im going to the 7elevennbsp people go to the 7eleven all the time and absolutely nothing happens to them so chances are that nothing is going to happen to you which means there is absolutely no point in panickingnbsp keep walking the first step was always the hardest but id discovered that once you got going it was all a lot easiernbsp in a relative sense anywaynbsp i forced myself to move forward trying hard to believe everything i was telling myself because if i let myself panic everything i feared would become a selffulfilling prophecynbsp i made it another half a block then slowed to a halt and turned to look behind me towards homenbsp a discarded sf chronicle fluttered and slid across a rectangle of light spilled across the pavementnbsp i turned again to look forwardnbsp the pale glow of the 7eleven was only a block awaynbsp it was so closenbsp but so was homenbsp as i stood there staring at the glow a figure emerged from the shadows and stepped into the streetnbsp give me a break nbsp this would certainly have been the moment to laugh if one was in the mood to do so and i could feel my body begin to reactnbsp but it was with all the symptoms of fear coming together one by onenbsp i shouldnt have thought about selffulfilling propheciesnbsp i didnt make any sudden moves i simply raised my foot to take a step landed with the swivel of an aboutface and started walking home at exactly the same pacenbspnbspnbsp but there some distance in front of me was the figure of a second man rising up from a crouch in the middle of the street as if hed been waiting for some timenbsp shes mine leo i whipped around and looked behind me at the guy whod shoutednbspnbsp i think not mason a british accent shouted backnbsp shes mine i whipped around again and looked at the guy whod answered a funny little wheezing sound came from my mouthnbsp im going to die i pulled at the messenger bag strapped across my chest and started scrabbling for the phone in my bag which was as always in times of dire need somewhere very far and very deepnbsp and while i was wheezing and frantically feeling out the corners of the bag the men started moving in on menbsp not more than a block away each was hunched over as if they were stalking me in my mind i screamed at the top of my lungsnbsp in reality i suspect it was nothing more than a futile squeaknbsp arms out taking tentative sideways steps as they moved in on me the men went silent with a kind of predatory focus that chilled me to the bone i dropped to the street upending my bagnbsp the contents spilled outnbsp tissues bandaids sunglasses money keys an expired drivers license and a few other bits of general crap that had no real purpose but to make me feel more normalnbsp last came my cellphone which reacted to my sudden lack of motor control by flying out of my grasp and tumbling across the pavement i glanced wildly in one direction down the street and then the othernbsp i thought of the way animals looked in that split second before striking out tearing away from encroaching predatorsnbsp sure enough the men left their marks sprinting full bore towards menbsp the pavement vibrated with the pounding of their feetnbsp terror clutched at my throatnbspnbspnbsp i couldnt get air into my lungsnbsp the curb spun around me as if it had been built in a circlenbsp dizzy and gasping i focused on my cellphonenbsp the pavement shook harder and i cringed down into it anticipating a fist or a boot in my face any momentnbsp i still couldnt breathe and i could barely movenbsp all i could do to prevent a complete surrender was to focus on the cellphonenbsp i inched toward it on my hands and knees leaving a trail of belongings in my wake if nothing else go down fighting nbsp but i knew those words were as hollow as the mantras id repeated over and over and over on the way here and i gave innbsp curling my head down into my knees i rolled onto my side in the streetnbsp even to save myself i couldnt work past the panic and the fearnbsp i felt so weaknbsp so so weak and i hate that feeling more than anything in the worldnbsp the endgame came in a flurry of arms and bodies and men shouting and muscle against musclenbsp i cringed again waiting for painnbsp silver streaked through the air and out of the corner of my eye i watched a gun flip end over end until it smashed down hard on the pavementnbsp i sensed a presence above me before he even opened his mouthnbsp then the british accent yelled ive got hernbsp two arms slid under my armpits and i was wrenched up from the streetnbsp ive got her he repeated his voice growling and angrynbsp how strange nbsp the emphasis was all funnynbsp the emphasis was on the ive though i had no idea why in a moment of terror i would even notice such a thingnbsp i waited for the end but he merely crushed me against his suit my face pressed into his chestnbsp sorry mason he saidnbsp you losenbsp a bit out of shape arent you i tripped on a goddamn big gulp cup the second voice said sullenly my captor started backing away and i was dragged along with his body movement like a rag dollnbsp the toes of my shoes scraped across the pavement as i hung limply in his hold my eyes squeezed shutnbsp this is where it ends he said i didnt know how a person might prepare herself to die and when a gunshot rang out in the next second i thought i might not have time to figure it outnbsp but the sound was answered merely by an angry gasp in my ear and a lurch sideways i fell away from my captor landing hard on the pavementnbsp this is where it begins the american voice said distinctly triumphantnbsp no one picked me up again and i dared to raise my head just in time to watch the two men bear down on each other like knights at some kind of 7elevensponsored urban joust my former captor the irritable british guy in the suit versus the other guy wearing a simple tshirt and jeansnbsp they were smashing their fists into each other and grappling like a couple of highschool wrestlers all because because let me get this straightnbsp are they fighting over who gets to mug me nbsp there was no time to process that questionnbsp hoping to god i wasnt bulletworthy i lifted myself to my kneesnbsp leaving all of my things behind shutting out the sound of punishing body contact and testosteronefueled grunting i crawled hand over hand knee over knee down the middle of the street towards homenbsp shaking so hard i could barely propel myself forward i was moving slower than seemed humanly possiblenbsp the likelihood of escape l roxanne zaborovsky i stopped crawlingnbsp only my closest friends knew about the lnbsp it wasnt even on my drivers licensenbsp its menbsp mason me the announcement was lost in a kind of garglenbsp hed probably just been hit in the face frozen in midcrawl i thought about itnbsp i really didnbsp then i decided to look over my shouldernbsp it all happened so fast from therenbsp the tshirt guy was struggling in a choke hold the suited guy behind him had one arm hooked around his necknbsp the nights darkness had leached to a smoky grey making it easier to see their facesnbsp one i didnt recognize at allnbsp the other the man in tshirt and jeans i could hardly believe itnbsp mason merrick mason merrick his eyes met mine and in the next second he made some fancy move and turned the tablesnbsp suddenly it was mason sitting on his adversarys chest punching the guy in the facenbsp he actually took a moment to look over at me and yelled get in the carnbsp the car id crawled up next to masons carnbsp along a typical bumpertobumper san francisco curbside id happened to crawl up next to masons carnbsp i recognized it immediatelynbsp i reached for the handle my fingers shaking so badly i could barely work them opened the door and kind of launched my body inside banging my shin hard on the stick shiftnbsp i locked the door pulled my feet up on the seat wrapped my arms around my knees and stared down at the keys in the ignition which were faintly tinkling against each other while i did my best to will myself home and into my room i never should have come out tonightnbsp i knew itnbsp selffulfilling prophecies have always been my downfall when i looked out the window again mason was still on top of his adversary but had one arm out searching blindly for the weapon just beyond his reachnbsp he had to sacrifice his hold but he finally got what he sought arching his back and grabbing the gun the brit used his opportunity to free himself but didnt get farnbsp mason swung the weapon into his face and yelled advantage the brit slowly got to his feet and i thought he was going to lungenbsp all of a sudden both men relaxednbsp they checked their cell phones of all things then calmly put them awaynbsp then they picked up the intensity of their conflict immediately as if it had never waned in the first placenbsp bizarre the air inside the car was suffocating the temperature seemed like it had very suddenly climbed over one hundrednbsp i automatically reached out to turn down the thermostat and froze with my arm stuck out in front of me as it registered that the car wasnt running so the heating system couldnt be onnbsp outside the air had held a bit of a bite a thin chill that prickled the skinnbsp inside this car it was sweltering hotter than seemed reasonable logicalpossible i pressed my body back against the seat my skin crawlingnbsp claustrophobia set innbsp sweat slipped down my burning face and onto my shirtnbsp i grabbed for the window handle but the mechanism was brokennbsp i couldnt even budge it an inchnbsp i looked out the window again frantically jiggling the knobnbspnbspnbsp still holding his gun on the british guy mason was all up in the other mans face and gesturing in my direction taunting himnbsp to my shock the british guy merely put his hands on his hips and swore violently at the groundnbsp mason flailed his gun around a bit more then to my shock the british guy just surrenderednbsp it seemed too easy despite my lack of knowledge of the circumstances and any relief i might have had about masons victory was tempered by the oddity of it allnbsp still it seemed i could take a chance on leaving the safety of the carnbsp i was suffocatingnbsp i thought i might even be sicknbsp my sweaty fingers grappled frantically at the door locknbsp i managed to pull it up wrench the handle and push the door opennbsp falling out of the car for a moment i just lay on my back in the filthy street staring up at the stars with my arms splayed above my head like a corpsenbsp breathing in huge gulps of cold air i thought to myself that the sky should be light grey by now but it still looked as dark as it had earliernbsp darker even pack it in leo i heard mason saynbsp no straight line here buddynbsp youll have to go around i turned my head and saw the man named leo shake his head and casually walk away brushing the dirt off his suit jacketnbsp mason stood quietly watching him go then he stuffed his gun in the waistband in back of his jeans and looked over his shoulder at menbsp i scrambled to my feet swaying backwards against the car as blood rushed to my headnbsp hey rox mason saidnbsp he walked to my bag and started stuffing my belongings back into itnbsp i was grateful for a few extra moments to compose myselfnbsp the last thing i wanted was for mason merrick to see me completely fall apart in front of himnbsp by the time he reached me i was as close as i was going to get to normalnbsp assuming normal is close to speechless and gapingnbsp if youd asked me back when my college roommate broke up with mason merrick whether or not id ever see the guy with the two last names again in my lifetime id have said that the chance was nilnbsp but then again the last time i saw him he was wearing nothing but boxer shorts and was eating my sugar cereal and id also have said that the chance of finding myself in a situation with him involving weaponry beyond a kitchen spoon was nilnbsp in the span of one short night both events had come to passnbsp and the thing is i dont believe in coincidencesnbsp
