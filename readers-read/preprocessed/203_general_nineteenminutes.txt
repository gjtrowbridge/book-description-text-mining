 in nineteen minutes you can mow the front lawn color your hair watch a third of a hockey game in nineteen minutes you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist you can fold laundry for a family of five nineteen minutes is how long it took the tennessee titans to sell out of tickets to the playoffs its the length of a sitcom minus the commercials its the driving distance from the vermont border to the town of sterling new hampshire in nineteen minutes you can order a pizza and get it delivered you can read a story to a child or have your oil changed you can walk a mile you can sew a hem in nineteen minutes you can stop the world or you can just jump off it in nineteen minutes you can get revenge as usual alex cormier was running late it took thirtytwo minutes to drive from her house in sterling to the superior court in grafton county new hampshire and that was only if she speeded through orford she hurried downstairs in her stockings carrying her heels and the files shed brought home with her over the weekend she twisted her thick copper hair into a knot and anchored it at the base of her neck with bobby pins transforming herself into the person she needed to be before she left her house alex had been a superior court judge now for thirtyfour days shed believed that having proved her mettle as a district court judge for the past five years this time around the appointment might be easier but at forty she was still the youngest judge in the state she still had to fight to establish herself as a fair justice her history as a public defender preceded her into her courtroom and prosecutors assumed shed side with the defense when alex had submitted her name years ago for the bench it had been with the sincere desire to make sure people in this legal system were innocent until proven guilty she just never anticipated that as a judge she might not be given the same benefit of the doubt the smell of freshly brewed coffee drew alex into the kitchen her daughter was hunched over a steaming mug at the kitchen table poring over a textbook josie looked exhausted her blue eyes were bloodshot her chestnut hair was a knotty ponytail tell me you havent been up all night alex said josie didnt even glance up i havent been up all night she parroted alex poured herself a cup of coffee and slid into the chair across from her honestly you asked me to tell you something josie said you didnt ask for the truth alex frowned you shouldnt be drinking coffee and you shouldnt be smoking cigarettes alex felt her face heat up i dont mom josie sighed even when you open up the bathroom windows i can still smell it on the towels she glanced up daring alex to challenge her other vices alex herself didnt have any other vices she didnt have time for any vices she would have liked to say that she knew with authority that josie didnt have any vices either but she would only be making the same inference the rest of the world did when they met josie a pretty popular straighta student who knew better than most the consequences of falling off the straightandnarrow a girl who was destined for great things a young woman who was exactly what alex had hoped her daughter would grow to become josie had once been so proud to have a mother as a judge alex could remember josie broadcasting her career to the tellers at the bank the baggers in the grocery store the flight attendants on planes shed ask alex about her cases and her decisions that had all changed three years ago when josie entered high school and the tunnel of communication between them slowly bricked shut alex didnt necessarily think that josie was hiding anything more than any other teenager but it was different a normal parent might metaphorically judge her childs friends whereas alex could do it legally whats on the docket today alex said unit test what about you arraignments alex replied she squinted across the table trying to read josies textbook upside down chemistry catalysts josie rubbed her temples substances that speed up a reaction but stay unchanged by it like if youve got carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen gas and you toss in zinc and chromium oxide andwhats the matter just having a little flashback of why i got a c in orgo have you had breakfast coffee josie said coffee doesnt count it does when youre in a rush josie pointed out alex weighed the costs of being even five minutes later or getting another black mark against her in the cosmic goodparenting tally shouldnt a seventeenyearold be able to take care of herself in the morning alex started pulling items out of the refrigerator eggs milk bacon i once presided over an involuntary emergency admission at the state mental hospital for a woman who thought she was emeril her husband had her committed when she put a pound of bacon in the blender and chased him around the kitchen with a knife yelling bam josie glanced up from her textbook for real oh believe me i cant make these things up alex cracked an egg into a skillet when i asked her why shed put a pound of bacon in the blender she looked at me and said that she and i must just cook differently josie stood up and leaned against the counter watching her mother cook domesticity wasnt alexs strong point she didnt know how to make a pot roast but was proud to have memorized the phone numbers of every pizza place and chinese restaurant in sterling that offered free delivery relax alex said dryly i think i can do this without setting the house on fire but josie took the skillet out of her hands and laid the strips of bacon in it like sailors bunking tightly together how come you dress like that she asked alex glanced down at her skirt blouse and heels and frowned why is it too margaret thatcher no i meanwhy do you bother no one knows what you have on under your robe you could wear like pajama pants or that sweater you have from college thats got holes in the elbows whether or not people see it im still expected to dresswell judiciously a cloud passed over josies face and she busied herself over the stove as if alex had somehow given the wrong answer alex stared at her daughter the bitten halfmoon fingernails the freckle behind her ear the zigzag part in her hair and saw instead the toddler whod wait at the babysitters window at sundown because she knew that was when alex came to get her ive never worn pajamas to work alex admitted but i do sometimes close the door to chambers and take a nap on the floor a slow surprised smile played over josies face she held her mothers admission as if it were a butterfly lighting on her hand by accident an event so startling you could not call attention to it without risking its loss but there were miles to drive and defendants to arraign and chemical equations to interpret and by the time josie had set the bacon to drain on a pad of paper toweling the moment had winged away i still dont get why i have to eat breakfast if you dont josie muttered because you have to be a certain age to earn the right to ruin your own life alex pointed at the scrambled eggs josie was mixing in the skillet promise me youll finish that josie met her gaze promise then im headed out alex grabbed her travel mug of coffee by the time she backed her car out of the garage her head was already focused on the decision she had to write that afternoon the number of arraignments the clerk would have stuffed onto her docket the motions that would have fallen like shadows across her desk between friday afternoon and this morning she was caught up in a world far away from home where at that very moment her daughter scraped the scrambled eggs from the skillet into the trash can without ever taking a single bite sometimes josie thought of her life as a room with no doors and no windows it was a sumptuous room sure a room half the kids in sterling high would have given their right arm to enter but it was also a room from which there really wasnt an escape either josie was someone she didnt want to be or she was someone who nobody wanted she lifted her face to the spray of the shower water shed made so hot it raised red welts stole breath steamed windows she counted to ten and then finally ducked away from the stream to stand naked and dripping in front of the mirror her face was swollen and scarlet her hair stuck to her shoulders in thick ropes she turned sideways scrutinized her flat belly and sucked it in a little she knew what matt saw when he looked at her what courtney and maddie and brady and haley and drew all saw she just wished that she could see it too the problem was when josie looked in the mirror she noticed what was underneath that raw skin instead of what had been painted upon it she understood how she was supposed to look and supposed to act she wore her dark hair long and straight she dressed in abercrombie fitch she listened to dashboard confessional and death cab for cutie she liked feeling the eyes of other girls in the school when she sat in the cafeteria borrowing courtneys makeup she liked the way teachers already knew her name on the first day of class she liked having guys stare at her when she walked down the hall with matts arm around her but there was a part of her that wondered what would happen if she let them all in on the secret that some mornings it was hard to get out of bed and put on someone elses smile that she was standing on air a fake who laughed at all the right jokes and whispered all the right gossip and attracted the right guy a fake who had nearly forgotten what it felt like to be real and who when you got right down to it didnt want to remember because it hurt even more than this there wasnt anyone to talk to if you even doubted your right to be one of the privileged popular set then you didnt belong there and matt well hed fallen for the josie on the surface like everyone else in fairy tales when the mask came off the handsome prince still loved the girl no matter what and that alone would turn her into a princess but high school didnt work that way what made her a princess was hooking up with matt and in some weird circular logic what made matt hook up with her was the very fact that she was one of sterling highs princesses she couldnt confide in her mother either you dont stop being a judge just because you step out of the courthouse her mother used to say it was why alex cormier never drank more than one glass of wine in public it was why she never yelled or cried a trial was a stupid word considering that an attempt was never good enough you were supposed to toe the line period many of the accomplishments that josies mother was most proud of josies grades her looks her acceptance into the right crowd had not been achieved because josie wanted them so badly herself but mostly because she was afraid of falling short of perfect josie wrapped a towel around herself and headed into her bedroom she pulled a pair of jeans out of her closet and then layered two longsleeved tees that showed off her chest she glanced at her clock if she wasnt going to be late shed have to get moving before leaving her room though she hesitated she sank down onto her bed and rummaged underneath the nightstand for the ziploc sandwich bag that shed tacked to the wooden frame inside was a stash of ambien pirated one pill at a time from her mothers prescription for insomnia so shed never notice it had taken josie nearly six months to inconspicuously gather only fifteen pills but she figured if she washed them down with a fifth of vodka it would do the trick it wasnt like she had a strategy really to kill herself next tuesday or when the snow melted or anything concrete like that it was more like a backup plan when the truth came out and no one wanted to be around her anymore it stood to reason josie wouldnt want to be around herself either she tacked the pills back beneath her nightstand and headed downstairs as she walked into the kitchen to load up her backpack she found her chemistry textbook still wide open and a longstemmed red rose marking her place matt was leaning against the refrigerator in the corner he must have let himself in through the open garage door like always he made her head swim with seasons his hair was all the colors of autumn his eyes the bright blue of a winter sky his smile as wide as any summer sun he was wearing a baseball hat backward and a sterling varsity hockey tee over a thermal shirt that josie had once stolen for a full month and hidden in her underwear drawer so that when she needed to she could breathe in the scent of him are you still pissed off he asked josie hesitated i wasnt the one who was mad matt pushed away from the refrigerator coming forward until he could link his arms around josies waist you know i cant help it a dimple blossomed in his right cheek josie could already feel herself softening it wasnt that i didnt want to see you i really did have to study matt pushed her hair off her face and kissed her this was exactly why shed told him not to come over last night when she was with him she felt herself evaporating sometimes when he touched her josie imagined herself vanishing in a puff of steam he tasted of maple syrup of apologies its all your fault you know he said i wouldnt act as crazy if i didnt love you so much at that moment josie could not remember the pills she was hoarding in her room she could not remember crying in the shower she could not remember anything but what it felt like to be adored im lucky she told herself the word streaming like a silver ribbon through her mind lucky lucky lucky patrick ducharme the sole detective on the sterling police force sat on a bench on the far side of the locker room listening to the patrol officers on the morning shift pick on a rookie with a little extra padding around the middle hey fisher eddie odenkirk said are you the one whos having the baby or is it your wife as the rest of the guys laughed patrick took pity on the kid its early eddie he said cant you at least wait to start in until weve all had a cup of coffee i would captain eddie laughed but it looks like fisher already ate all the donuts and what the hell is that patrick followed eddies gaze downward to his own feet he did not as a matter of course change in the locker room with the patrol officers but hed jogged to the station this morning instead of driving to work off too much good cooking consumed over the weekend hed spent saturday and sunday in maine with the girl who currently held his heart his goddaughter a fiveandahalfyearold named tara frost her mother nina was patricks oldest friend and the one love he probably would never get over although she managed to be doing quite well without him over the course of the weekend patrick had deliberately lost ten thousand games of candy land had given countless piggyback rides had had his hair done and here was his cardinal mistake had allowed tara to put bright pink nail polish on his toes which patrick had forgotten to remove he glanced down at his feet and curled his toes under chicks think its hot he said gruffly as the seven men in the locker room struggled not to snicker at someone who was technically their superior patrick yanked his dress socks on slipped into his loafers and walked out still holding his tie one he counted two three on cue laughter spilled out of the locker room following him down the hallway in his office patrick closed the door and peered at himself in the tiny mirror on the back his black hair was still damp from his shower his face was flushed from his run he shimmied the knot of his tie up his neck fashioning the noose and then sat down at his desk seventytwo emails had come in over the weekend and usually anything more than fifty meant he wouldnt get home before 800 pm all week he began to weed through them adding notes to a devils to do list one that never got any shorter no matter how hard he worked today patrick had to drive drugs down to the state lab not a big deal except that it was a fourhour block of his day that vanished right there he had a rape case coming to fruition the perp identified from a college face book and his statements transcribed and ready for the ags office he had a cell phone that had been nabbed out of a car by a homeless guy he had blood results come back from the lab as a match for a breakin at a jewelry store and a suppression hearing in superior court and already on his desk was the first new complaint of the day a theft of wallets in which the credit cards had been used leaving a trail for patrick to trace being a smalltown detective required patrick to be firing on all cylinders all the time unlike cops he knew who worked for city departments where they had twentyfour hours to solve a case before it was considered cold patricks job was to take everything that came across his desk not to cherrypick for the interesting ones it was hard to get excited about a bad check case or a theft that would net the perp a 200 fine when it cost the taxpayers five times that to have patrick focus on it for a week but every time he started thinking that his cases werent particularly important hed find himself facetoface with a victim the hysterical mother whose wallet had been stolen the momandpop jewelry store owners whod been robbed of their retirement income the rattled professor who was a victim of identity theft hope patrick knew was the exact measure of distance between himself and the person whod come for help if patrick didnt get involved if he didnt give a hundred percent then that victim was going to be a victim forever which was why since patrick had joined the sterling police he had managed to solve every single case and yet when patrick was lying in his bed alone and letting his mind sew a seam across the hem of his life he did not remember the proven successes only the potential failures when he walked around the perimeter of a vandalized barn or found the stolen car stripped down and dumped in the woods or handed the tissue to the sobbing girl whod been dateraped patrick couldnt help but feel that he was too late he was a detective but he didnt detect anything it fell into his lap already broken every time it was the first warm day of march the one where you started to believe that the snow would melt sooner rather than later and that june was truly just around the corner josie sat on the hood of matts saab in the student parking lot thinking that it was closer to summer than it was to the start of this school year that in a scant three months she would officially be a member of the senior class beside her matt leaned against the windshield his face tipped up to the sun lets ditch school he said its too nice out to be stuck inside all day if you ditch youll be benched the state championship tournament in hockey began this afternoon and matt played right wing sterling had won last year and they had every expectation of doing it again youre coming to the game matt said and it wasnt a question but a statement are you going to score matt smiled wickedly and tugged her on top of him dont i always he said but he wasnt talking about hockey anymore and she felt a blush rise over the collar of her scarf suddenly josie felt a rain of hail on her back they both sat up to find brady pryce a football player walking by handinhand with haley weaver the homecoming queen haley tossed a second shower of pennies sterling highs way of wishing an athlete good luck kick ass today royston brady called their math teacher was crossing the parking lot too with a worn black leather briefcase and a thermos of coffee hey mr mccabe matt called out howd i do on last fridays test luckily youve got other talents to fall back on mr royston the teacher said as he reached into his pocket he winked at josie as he pitched the coins pennies that fell from the sky onto her shoulders like confetti like stars coming loose it figures alex thought as she stuffed the contents of her purse back inside she had switched handbags and left her pass key at home which allowed her into the employee entrance at the rear of the superior court although shed pushed the buzzer a million times no one seemed to be around to let her in goddamn she muttered under her breath hiking around the slush puddles so that her alligator heels wouldnt get ruined one of the perks of parking in the back was not having to do this she could cut through the clerks office to her chambers and if the planets were aligned maybe even onto the bench without causing a delay in the docket although the public entrance of the court had a line twenty people long the court officers recognized alex because unlike the district court circuit where you bounced from courthouse to courthouse she would be ensconced here for six months the officers waved her to the front of the line but since she was carrying keys and a stainless steel travel thermos and god only knew what else in her purse she set off the metal detectors the alarm was a spotlight every eye in the lobby turned to see whod gotten caught ducking her head alex hurried across the polished tile floor and nearly lost her footing as she pitched forward a squat man reached forward to steady her hey baby he said leering i like your shoes without responding alex yanked herself out of his grasp and headed toward the clerks office none of the other superior court judges had to deal with this judge wagner was a nice guy but with a face that looked like a pumpkin left to rot after halloween judge gerhardt a fellow female had blouses that were older than alex when alex had first come to the bench shed thought that being a relatively young moderately attractive woman was a good thing a vote against typecasting but on mornings like this she wasnt so sure she dumped her purse in chambers shrugged into her robe and took five minutes to drink her coffee and review the docket each case got its own file but cases for repeat offenders were rubberbanded together and sometimes judges wrote postit notes to each other inside about the case alex opened one and saw a picture of a stickfigure man with bars in front of his face a signal from judge gerhardt that this was the offenders last chance and that next time he should go to jail she rang the buzzer to signify to the court officer that she was ready to start and waited to hear her cue all rise the honorable alexandra cormier presiding walking into a courtroom to alex always felt as if she were stepping onto a stage for the first time at a broadway opening you knew there would be people there you knew their gazes would all be focused on you but that didnt prevent you from having a moment when you could not breathe could not believe you were the one they had come to see alex moved briskly behind the bench and sat down there were seventy arraignments scheduled for that morning and the courtroom was packed the first defendant was called and he shuffled past the bar with his eyes averted mr oreilly alex said and as the man met her gaze she recognized him as the guy from the lobby he was clearly uncomfortable now that he realized whom hed been flirting with youre the gentleman who assisted me earlier arent you he swallowed yes your honor if youd known i was the judge mr oreilly would you have said hey baby i like your shoes the defendant glanced down weighing impropriety against honesty i guess so your honor he said after a moment those are great shoes the entire courtroom went still anticipating her reaction alex smiled broadly mr oreilly she said i couldnt agree more lacy houghton leaned over the bed railing and put her face right in front of her sobbing patients you can do this she said firmly you can do this and you will after sixteen hours of labor they were all exhausted lacy the patient and the fathertobe who was facing zerohour with the dawning realization that he was superfluous that right now his wife wanted her midwife much more than she wanted him i want you to get behind janine lacy told him and brace her back janine i want you to look at me and give me another good push the woman gritted her teeth and bore down losing all sense of herself in the effort to create someone else lacy reached down to feel the babys head to guide it past the seal of skin and quickly loop the cord over its head without ever losing eye contact with her patient for the next twenty seconds your baby is going to be the newest person on this planet lacy said would you like to meet her the answer was a pressured push a crest of intention a roar of purpose a sluice of slick purpled body that lacy quickly lifted into the mothers arms so that when the infant cried for the first time in this life she would already be in a position to be comforted her patient started weeping again tears had a whole different melody didnt they without the pain threaded through them the new parents bent over their baby a closed circle lacy stepped back and watched there was plenty of work left for a midwife to do even after the moment of birth but for right now she wanted to make eye contact with this little being where parents would notice a chin that looked like aunt marges or a nose that resembled grandpas lacy would see instead a gaze wide with wisdom and peace eight pounds of unadulterated possibility newborns reminded her of tiny buddhas faces full of divinity it didnt last long though when lacy saw these same infants a week later at their regular checkups they had turned into ordinary albeit tiny people that holiness somehow disappeared and lacy was always left wondering where in this world it might go while his mother was across town delivering the newest resident of sterling new hampshire peter houghton was waking up his father knocked on the door on his way out to work peters alarm clock downstairs a bowl and a box of cereal would be waiting for him his mother remembered to do that even when she got paged at two in the morning there would be a note from her too telling him to have a good day at school as if it were that simple peter threw back his covers he moved to his desk still wearing his pajama bottoms sat down and logged onto the internet the words on the message board were blurry he reached for his glasses he kept them next to his computer after he slipped the frames on he dropped the case onto the keyboard and suddenly he was seeing something hed hoped never to see again peter reached out and hit control alt delete but he could still picture it even after the screen went blank even after he closed his eyes even after he started to cry in a town the size of sterling everyone knew everyone else and always had in some ways this was comforting like a great big extended family that you sometimes loved and sometimes fell out of favor with at other times it haunted josie like right now when she was standing in the cafeteria line behind natalie zlenko a dyke of the first order who way back in second grade had invited josie over to play and had convinced her to pee on the front lawn like a boy what were you thinking her mother had said when shed come to pick her up and saw them barebottomed and squatting over the daffodils even now a decade later josie couldnt look at natalie zlenko with her buzz cut and her everpresent slr camera without wondering if natalie still thought about that too on josies other side was courtney ignatio the alpha female of sterling high with her honeyblond hair hanging over her shoulders like a shawl made of silk and her lowrise jeans mailordered from fred segal shed spawned an entourage of clones on courtneys tray was a bottle of water and a banana on josies was a platter of french fries it was second period and just like her mother had predicted she was famished hey courtney said loud enough for natalie to overhear can you tell the vagitarian to let us pass natalies cheeks burned with color and she flattened herself up against the sneeze guard of the salad bar so that courtney and josie could slip by they paid for their food and walked across the cafeteria whenever she came into the cafeteria josie felt like a naturalist observing different species in their natural nonacademic habitat there were the geeks bent over their textbooks and laughing at math jokes nobody else even wanted to understand behind them were the art freaks who smoked clove cigarettes on the ropes course behind the school and drew manga comics in the margins of their notes near the condiment bar were the skanks who drank black coffee and waited for the bus that would take them to the technical high school three towns over for their afternoon classes and the druggies already strung out by nine oclock in the morning there were misfits too kids like natalie and angela phlug fringe friends by default because nobody else would have them and then there was josies posse they took over two tables not because there were so many of them but because they were larger than life emma maddie haley john brady trey drew josie could remember how when she started hanging around with this group shed get everyones names confused they were that interchangeable they all sort of looked alike too the boys all wearing their maroon home hockey jerseys and their hats backward bright thatches of hair stuck through the loops at their foreheads like the start of a fire the girls carbon copies of courtney by studious design josie slipped inconspicuously into the heart of them because she looked like courtney too her tangle of hair had been blown glassstraight her heels were three inches high even though there was still snow on the ground if she appeared the same on the outside it was that much easier to ignore the fact that she didnt really know how she felt on the inside hey maddie said as courtney sat down beside her hey did you hear about fiona kierland courtneys eyes lit up gossip was as good a catalyst as any chemical the one whose boobs are two different sizes no thats fiona the sophomore im talking about fiona the freshman the one who always carries a box of tissues for her allergies josie said sliding into a seat or not haley said guess who got sent to rehab for snorting coke get out thats not even the whole scandal emma added her dealer was the head of the bible study group that meets after school oh my god courtney said exactly hey matt slipped into the chair beside josie what took you so long she turned to him at this end of the table the guys were rolling straw wrappers into spitballs and talking about the end of spring skiing how long do you think the halfpipe will stay open at sunapee john asked lobbing a spitball toward a kid one table away who had fallen asleep the boy had been in josies sign language elective last year like her he was a junior his arms and legs were skinny and white and splayed like a stickbug his mouth as he snored was wideopen you missed loser drew said if sunapee closes killingtons still good they have snow until like august his spitball landed in the boys hair derek the kids name was derek matt glanced at josies french fries youre not going to eat those are you im starving he pinched the side of her waist a caliper and a criticism all at once josie looked down at the fries ten seconds ago theyd looked golden brown and smelled like heaven now all she could see was the grease that stained the paper plate matt took a handful and passed the rest to drew who threw a spitball that landed in the sleeping boys mouth with a choke and a sputter derek startled awake sweet drew highfived john derek spat into a napkin and rubbed his mouth hard he glanced around to see who else had been watching josie suddenly remembered a sign from her asl elective almost all of which shed forgotten the moment shed taken the final a closed fist moved in a circle over the heart meant im sorry matt leaned over and kissed her neck lets get out of here he drew josie to her feet and then turned to his friends later he said the gymnasium at sterling high school was on the second floor above what would have been a swimming pool if the bond issue had passed when the school was in its planning stages and what instead became three classrooms that continually resounded with the pounding of sneakered feet and bouncing basketballs michael beach and his best friend justin friedman two freshmen sat on the sidelines of the basketball court while their phys ed teacher went over the mechanics of dribbling for the hundredth time it was a wasted exercise kids in this class were either like noah james already an expert or like michael and justin who were fluent in elvish but defined home run as what you did after school in order to avoid getting hung up on coat hooks by your underwear they sat crosslegged and knobkneed listening to the rodents squeak of coach spearss white sneakers as he hustled from one end of the court to the other ten bucks says i get picked last for a team justin murmured i wish we could get out of class michael commiserated maybe therell be a fire drill justin grinned an earthquake a monsoon locusts a terrorist attack two sneakers stopped in front of them coach spears glared down his arms folded you two want to tell me whats so funny about basketball michael glanced at justin then up at the coach absolutely nothing he said after showering lacy houghton made herself a mug of green tea and wandered peacefully through her house when the kids had been tiny and shed been overwhelmed by work and life lewis would ask her what he could do to make things better it had been a great irony for her given lewiss job a professor at sterling college his specialty was the economics of happiness yes it was a real field of study and yes he was an expert hed taught seminars and written articles and had been interviewed on cnn about measuring the effects of pleasure and good fortune on a monetary scale and yet hed been at a loss when it came to figuring out what lacy would enjoy did she want to go out to a nice dinner get a pedicure take a nap when she told him what she craved though he could not comprehend shed wanted to be in her own house with nobody else in it and nothing pressing to do she opened the door to peters room and set her mug on the dresser so that she could make his bed whats the point peter would say when she dogged him to do it himself i just have to mess it up again in a few hours for the most part she didnt enter peters room unless he was in it maybe that was why at first she felt there was something wrong about the space as if an integral part were missing at first she assumed that it was peters absence that made the room seem a little empty then she realized that the computer a steady hum an everready green screen had been turned off she tugged the sheets up and tucked in the edges she drew the quilt over them and fluffed the pillows at the threshold of peters bedroom she paused and smiled the room looked perfect zoe patterson was wondering what it was like to kiss a guy who had braces not that it was a remote possibility for her anytime in the near future but she figured it was something she ought to consider before the moment actually caught her off guard in fact she wondered what it would be like to kiss a guy period even one who wasnt orthodontically challenged like her and honestly was there any place better than a stupid math class to let your mind wander mr mccabe who thought he was the chris rock of algebra was doing his daily standup routine so two kids are in the lunch line when the first kid turns to his friend and says i have no money what should i do and his buddy says 2x 5 zoe looked up at the clock she counted along with the second hand until it was 950 on the dot and then popped out of her seat to hand mr mccabe a pass ah orthodontia he read out loud well make sure he doesnt wire your mouth shut ms patterson so the buddy says 2x 5 a binomial get it buynomeal zoe hefted her backpack onto her shoulders and walked out of the classroom she had to meet her mom in front of the school at ten oclock parking was killer so it would be a driveby pickup midclass the halls were hollow and resonant it felt like trudging through the belly of a whale zoe detoured into the main office to sign out on the secretarys clipboard and then nearly mowed down a kid in her hurry to get outside it was warm enough to unzip her jacket and think of summer and soccer camp and what it would be like when her palate expander was finally removed if you kissed a guy who didnt have braces and you pressed too hard could you cut his gums something told zoe that if you made a guy bleed you probably wouldnt be hooking up with him again what if he had braces too like that blond kid from chicago whod just transferred and sat in front of her in english not that she liked him or anything although he had turned around to hand her back her homework paper and held on to it just a smidgen too long would they get stuck together like jammed gears and have to be taken to the emergency room at the hospital and how totally humiliating would that be zoe ran her tongue along the ragged metal fence posts in her mouth maybe she could temporarily join a convent she sighed and peered down the block to see whether she could make out her moms green explorer from the conga line of passing cars and just about then something exploded patrick sat at a red light in his unmarked police car waiting to turn onto the highway beside him on the passenger seat was a paper bag with a vial of cocaine inside it the dealer theyd busted at the high school had admitted it was cocaine and yet patrick had to waste half his day taking it to the state lab so that someone in a white coat could tell him what he already knew he fiddled with the volume button of the dispatch radio just in time to hear the fire department being sent to the high school for an explosion probably the boiler the school was old enough for its internal structure to be falling apart he tried to remember where the boiler was located in sterling high and wondered if theyd be lucky enough to come out of that kind of situation without anyone being hurt shots fired the light turned green but patrick didnt move the discharge of a gun in sterling was rare enough to have him narrow his attention to the voice on the dispatch radio waiting for an explanation at the high school sterling high the dispatchers voice was getting faster more intense patrick wheeled the car in a uturn and started toward the school with his lights flashing other voices began to transmit in static bursts officers stating their positions in town the onduty supervisor trying to coordinate manpower and calling for mutual aid from hanover and lebanon their voices knotted and tangled blocking one another so that everything and nothing was being said at once signal 1000 the dispatcher said signal 1000 in patricks entire career as a detective hed only heard that call twice once was in maine when a deadbeat dad had taken an officer hostage once was in sterling during a potential bank robbery that turned out to be a false alarm signal 1000 meant that everyone immediately was to get off the radio and leave it free for dispatch it meant that what they were dealing with was not routine police business it meant life or death chaos was a constellation of students running out of the school and trampling the injured a boy holding a handmade sign in an upstairs window that read help us two girls hugging each other and sobbing chaos was blood melting pink on the snow it was the drip of parents that turned into a stream and then a raging river screaming out the names of their missing children chaos was a tv camera in your face not enough ambulances not enough officers and no plan for how to react when the world as you knew it went to pieces patrick pulled halfway onto the sidewalk and grabbed his bulletproof vest from the back of the car already adrenaline pulsed through him making the edges of his vision swim and his senses more acute he found chief orourke standing with a megaphone in the middle of the melee we dont know what were dealing with yet the chief said sous on its way patrick didnt give a damn about the special operations unit by the time the swat team got here a hundred more shots might be fired a kid might be killed he drew his gun im going in the hell you are thats not protocol there is no fucking protocol for this patrick snapped you can fire me later as he raced up the steps to the school he was vaguely aware of two other patrol officers bucking the chiefs commands and joining him in the fray patrick directed them each down a different hallway and then he himself pushed through the double doors past students who were shoving each other in an effort to get outside fire alarms blared so loudly that patrick had to strain to hear the gunshots he grabbed the coat of a boy streaking past him who is it he yelled whos shooting the kid shook his head speechless and wrenched away patrick watched him run crazily down the hallway open the door burst into a rectangle of sunlight students funneled around him as if he were a stone in a river smoke billowed and burned his eyes patrick heard another staccato of gunshots and had to restrain himself from running toward them blindly how many of them he cried as a girl ran by ii dont know the boy beside her turned around and looked at patrick torn between offering knowledge and getting the hell out of there its a kidhes shooting everyone that was enough patrick pushed against the tide a salmon swimming upstream homework papers were scattered on the floor shell casings rolled beneath the heels of his shoes ceiling tiles had been shot off and a fine gray dust coated the broken bodies that lay twisted on the floor patrick ignored all of this going against most of his training running past doors that might hide a perp disregarding rooms that should have been searched instead driving forward with his weapon drawn and his heart beating through every inch of his skin later he would remember other sights that he didnt have time to register right away the heating duct covers that had been pried loose so that students could hide in the crawl space the shoes left behind by kids who literally ran out of them the eerie prescience of crimescene outlines on the floor outside the biology classrooms where students had been tracing their own bodies on butcher paper for an assignment he ran through hallways that seemed to circle in on each other where he would bite out every time he passed a fleeing student his only tool of navigation hed see sprays of blood and students crumpled on the ground and he did not let himself look twice he pounded up the main stairwell and just as he reached the top a door cracked open patrick whirled pointing his gun as a young female teacher fell to her knees with her hands raised behind the white oval of her face were twelve others featureless and frightened patrick could smell urine he lowered his gun and beckoned her toward the staircase go he commanded but he did not stay long enough to see if they did turning a corner patrick slipped on blood and heard another gunshot this one loud enough to ring his ears he swept into the open double doors of the gymnasium and scanned the handful of sprawled bodies the basketball cart overturned and the globes resting against the far wall but no shooter he knew from the overtime detail hed taken on friday nights to monitor high school ball games that hed reached the far end of sterling high which meant that the shooter was either hiding somewhere here or had doubled back past him when patrick hadnt noticedand could even now have cornered him in this gym patrick spun around to the entrance again to see if that was the case and then heard another shot he ran to a door that led out from the gym one he hadnt noticed in his first quick visual sweep of the area it was a locker room tiled white on the walls and the floor he glanced down saw the fanned spray of blood at his feet and edged his gun around the corner wall two bodies lay unmoving at one end of the locker room at the other closer to patrick a slight boy crouched beside a bank of lockers he wore wirerimmed glasses crooked on his thin face he was shivering hard are you okay patrick whispered he did not want to speak out loud and give away his position to the shooter the boy only blinked at him where is he patrick mouthed the boy pulled a pistol from beneath his thigh and held it up to his own head a new rush of heat surged through patrick dont fucking move he shouted drawing a bead on the boy drop the gun or i will shoot you sweat broke out down his back and on his forehead and he could feel his cupped hands shifting on the butt of the gun as he aimed determined to lace the kid with bullets if he had to patrick let his forefinger brush gently against the trigger just as the boy opened his fingers wide as a starfish the pistol fell to the floor skittering across the tile immediately he pounced one of the other officers whom patrick hadnt even noticed following him retrieved the boys weapon patrick dropped the kid onto his stomach and cuffed him pressing his knee hard into the boys spine are you alone whos with you just me the boy ground out patricks head was spinning and his pulse was a military tattoo but he could vaguely hear the other officer calling this information in over the radio sterling we have one in custody we dont have knowledge of anyone else just as seamlessly as it had started it was over at least as much as something like this could be considered over patrick didnt know if there were booby traps or bombs in the school he didnt know how many casualties there were he didnt know how many wounded dartmouthhitchcock medical center and alice peck day hospital could take he didnt know how to go about processing a crime scene this massive the target had been taken out but at what irreplaceable cost patricks entire body began to shake knowing that for so many students and parents and citizens today he had once again been too late he took a few steps and sank down to his knees mostly because his legs simply gave out from underneath them and pretended that this was intentional that he wanted to check out the two bodies at the other end of the room he was vaguely aware of the shooter being pushed out of the locker room by the other officer to a waiting cruiser downstairs he didnt turn to watch the kid go instead he focused on the body directly in front of him a boy dressed in a hockey jersey there was a puddle of blood underneath his side and a gunshot wound through his forehead patrick reached out for a baseball cap that had fallen a few feet away with the words sterling hockey embroidered across it he turned the brim around in his hands an imperfect circle the girl lying next to him was facedown blood spreading from beneath her temple she was barefoot and on her toenails was bright pink polish just like the stuff tara had put on patrick it made his heart catch this girl just like his goddaughter and her brother and a million other kids in this country had gotten up today and gone to school never imagining she would be in danger she trusted all the grownups and teachers and principals to keep her safe it was why these schools post911 had teachers wearing id all the time and doors locked during the day the enemy was always supposed to be an outsider not the kid who was sitting right next to you suddenly the girl shifted help me patrick knelt beside her im here he said his touch gentle as he assessed her condition everythings all right he turned her enough to see that the blood was coming from a cut on her scalp not a gunshot wound as hed assumed he ran his hands over her limbs he kept murmuring to her words that did not always make sense but that let her know that she wasnt alone anymore whats your name sweetheart josie the girl started to thrash trying to sit up patrick put the bulk of his body strategically between her and the boys shed be in shock already he didnt need her to go over the edge she touched her hand to her forehead and when it came away oily with blood she panicked what happened he should have stayed there and waited for the medics to come get her he should have radioed for help but should hardly seemed to apply anymore and so patrick lifted josie into his arms he carried her out of the locker room where shed nearly been killed hurried down the stairs and pushed through the front door of the school as if he might be able to save them both
