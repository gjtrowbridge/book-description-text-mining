 eight years later the motorcade streamed into the treeshaded parking lot where it disgorged numerous people who looked hot tired and genuinely unhappy the miniature army marched toward the ugly white brick building the structure had been many things in its time and currently housed a decrepit funeral home that was thriving solely because there was no other such facility within thirty miles and the dead of course had to go somewhere appropriately somber gentlemen in black suits stood next to hearses of the same color a few bereaved trickled out the door sobbing quietly into handkerchiefs an old man in a tattered suit that was too large for him and wearing a battered oily stetson sat on a bench outside the front entrance whittling it was just that sort of a place rural to the hilt stock car racing and bluegrass ballads forever the old fellow looked up curiously as the procession passed by with a tall distinguishedlooking man ceremoniously in the middle the elderly gent just shook his head and grinned at this spectacle showing the few tobaccostained teeth he had left then he took a nip of refreshment from a flask pulled from his pocket and returned to his artful wood carving the woman in her early thirties and dressed in a black pantsuit was in step behind the tall man in the past her heavy pistol in the belt holster had scraped uncomfortably against her side causing a scab as a solution shed sewn an extra layer of cloth into her blouses at that spot and learned to live with any lingering irritation shed overheard some of her men joke that all female agents should wear double shoulder holsters because it gave them a buxom look without expensive breast enhancement yes testosterone was alive and well in her world secret service agent michelle maxwell was on the extreme fast track she was not yet at the white house detail guarding the president of the united states but she was close barely nine years in the service and she was already a protection detail leader most agents spent a decade in the field doing investigative work before even graduating to protection detail as shift agents yet michelle maxwell was used to getting to places before other folks this was her big preview before almost certain reassignment to the white house and she was worried this was an unscheduled stop and that meant no advance team and limited backup yet because it was a lastminute change in plan the plus side was no one could know they were going to be there they reached the entrance and michelle put a firm hand on the tall mans arm and told him to wait while they scoped things out the place was quiet smelled of death and despair in quiet pockets of misery centered on coffins in each of the viewing rooms she posted agents at various key points along the mans path giving feet as it was called in service parlance properly done the simple act of having a professional with a gun and communication capability standing in a doorway could work wonders she spoke into her walkietalkie and the tall man john bruno was brought in she led him down the hallway as gazes from the viewing rooms wandered to them a politician and his entourage on the campaign trail were like a herd of elephants they could travel nowhere lightly they stomped the earth until it hurt with the weight of the guards chiefs of staff spokespersons speechwriters publicity folks gofers and others it was a spectacle that if it didnt make you laugh would at least cause you considerable worry about the future of the country john bruno was running for the office of president of the united states and he had absolutely no chance of winning looking far younger than his fiftysix years he was an independent candidate whod used the support of a small but strident percentage of the electorate fed up with just about everything mainstream to qualify for each states national ballot thus hed been given secret service protection though not at the staffing level of a bona fide contender it was michelle maxwells job to keep him alive until the election she was counting the days bruno was a former ironballs prosecutor and hed made a great number of enemies only some of whom were currently behind bars his political planks were fairly simple hed tell you he wanted government off the backs of the people and free enterprise to rule as for the poor and weak those not up to the task of unfettered competition well in all other species the weak died and the strong prevailed and why should it be any different for us largely because of that position the man had no chance of winning although america loved its tough guys they werent ready to vote for leaders who exhibited no compassion for the downtrodden and miserable for on any given day they might constitute a majority the trouble started when bruno entered the room trailed by his chief of staff two aides michelle and three of her men the widow sitting in front of her husbands coffin looked up sharply michelle couldnt see her expression through the veil the woman was wearing but assumed her look was one of surprise at seeing this herd of interlopers invading hallowed ground the old woman got up and retreated to a corner visibly shaking the candidate whirled on michelle he was a dear friend of mine bruno snapped and i am not going to parade in with an army get out he added tersely ill stay she fired back just me he shook his head theyd had many such standoffs he knew that his candidacy was a hopeless long shot and that just made him try even harder the pace had been brutal the protection logistics a nightmare no this is private he growled bruno looked over at the quivering woman in the corner my god youre scaring her to death this is repugnant michelle went back one more time to the well he refused yet again leading them all out of the room berating them as he did what the hell could happen to him in a funeral home was the eightyyearold widow going to jump him was the dead man going to come back to life michelle sensed that her protectee was really upset because she was costing him valuable campaign time yet it wasnt her idea to come here however bruno was in no mood to hear that no chance to win and the man acted like he was king of the hill of course on election day the voters including michelle would kick his butt right out the door as a compromise michelle asked for two minutes to sweep the room this was granted and her men moved quickly to do so while she silently fumed telling herself that she had to save her ammo for the really important battles her men came out 120 seconds later and reported everything okay only one door in and out no windows old lady and dead guy the only occupants it was cool not perfect but okay michelle nodded at her candidate bruno could have his private face time and then they could get out of here inside the viewing room bruno closed the door behind him and walked over to the open coffin there was another coffin against the far wall it was also open but empty the deceaseds coffin was resting on a raised platform with a white skirting that was surrounded waisthigh with an assortment of beautiful flowers bruno paid his respects to the body lying there murmuring so long bill as he turned to the widow whod returned to her chair he knelt in front of her gently held one of her hands im so sorry mildred so very sorry he was a good man the bereaved looked up at him from behind the veil smiled and then looked down again brunos expression changed and he looked around though the only other occupant of the room was in no condition to eavesdrop now you mentioned something else you wanted to talk about in private yes the widow said in a very low voice im afraid i dont have much time mildred what is it in answer she placed a hand on his cheek and then her fingers touched his neck bruno grimaced as he felt the sharp prick against his skin and then he slipped to the floor unconscious
