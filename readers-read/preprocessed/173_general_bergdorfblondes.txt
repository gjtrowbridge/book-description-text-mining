chapter one bergdorf blondes are a thing you know a new york craze absolutely everyone wants to be one but its actually trs difficult you wouldnt believe the dedication it takes to be a gorgeous flaxenhaired dermatologically perfect new york girl with a life thats fabulous beyond belief honestly it all requires a level of commitment comparable to say learning hebrew or quitting cigarettes getting the hair color right is murder for a start it all began with my best friend julie bergdorf shes the ultimate new york girl since glamorous thin blonde departmentstore heiresses are the chicest thing to be here someone heard shed been going to ariette at bergdorf for her color since high school because apparently she told her personal shopper at calvin klein who told all her clients anyway it was rumored in certain circles that julie got her blonde touched up every thirteen days exactly and suddenly everyone else wanted to be thirteenday blondes the hair cant be yellow it has to be very white like carolyn bessette kennedys was shes the icon the hair to worship its beyond expensive ariette is like 450 a highlight if you can get in with her which obviously you cant inevitably bergdorf blondes are talked and gossiped about endlessly every time you open a magazine or newspaper theres another item about a bbs latest romantic drama or new obsession right now its fringed missoni dresses but sometimes gossip is by far the most reliable source of information about yourself and all your friends especially in manhattan i always say why trust myself when gossip can tell moi the real truth about moi anyway according to gossip im this champagne bubble of a girl about town new york being the only town that cares about having girls about it living the perfect partygirl life if thats what you think a perfect life is i never tell a soul this but sometimes before the parties i look in the mirror and see someone who looks like they are straight out of a movie like fargo ive heard that almost all manhattan girls suffer from this debilitating condition they never admit it either julie gets the fargos so badly that shes never able to leave her apartment in the pierre in time for anything she has to be in time for everyone thinks the partygirl life is the best life you can lead here the truth is that combined with work its completely draining but no one dares say that in case they look ungrateful all anyone in new york ever says is everythings fabulous even if theyre on zoloft for depression still there are plenty of upsides like you never have to pay for anything important like manis or pedis or highlights or blowouts the downside is that sometimes the freebies wreak havoc with your social life believe me if your dermatologists kid cant get into episcopal hell be on the phone to you day and night to be specific last tuesday i went to my friend mimis townhouse on sixtythird and madison for her superdupercasual baby shower just the girls getting together shed said there were three staff per guest handmade pink cookies from payard patisserie on lexington and chocolate booties from fauchon it was about as casual as the inauguration no one ate a thing which is standard protocol at upper east side baby showers id just walked through the door when my cell rang hello i said you need highlights yelled a desperate voice it was george my hairdresser i use george when i cant get in with ariette which is almost all the time because shes permanently booked with julie are you in arizona i asked arizona is what everyone says instead of rehab a lot of hairdressers in new york visit arizona almost every month just back he replied if you dont go blonde you are going to be a very lonely girl continued george tearfully even though youd think george being a hairdresser would know this already i explained that a brunette like me cant go blonde can in new york he said choking up i ended up spending the presentopening ceremony in mimis library discussing addictive personality types with george and hearing all the oneliners hed picked up in rehab like say what you mean and mean what you say and dont be mean when you say it every time george goes into rehab he starts talking more and more like the dalai lama personally i think if hairdressers are going to offer deep insights they should be exclusively on the subject of hair anyway no one thought georges behavior was odd because everyone in new york takes calls from their beauty experts at social occasions it was lucky i was out of the room when mimi opened my gift which was a library of beatrix potter books she totally freaked because it was more books than shed ever read now i know why most girls give fashion from bonpoint rather than controversial literature at baby showers sometimes the hairdressers and their addictions and the parties and the blowouts take up so much time it starts to feel like work and you cant focus on your real career and i do have a real career to think aboutmore of which later but thats what happens in manhattan everything just kind of creeps up on you and before you know it youre out every night working like crazy and secretly waxing the hair on the inside of your nose like everyone else its not long before you start thinking that if you dont do the nosehairwax thing your whole worlds going to fall apart before i give you the rest of the goss from mimis shower here are a few character traits you might want to know about me58 1 fluent in french intermittently im really good at words like moi and trs which seem to take care of just about everything a girl needs a few unkind people have pointed out that this does not make me exactly fluent but i say well thats lucky because if i spoke perfect fluent french no one would like me and no one likes a perfect girl do they 2 always concerned for others wellbeing i mean if a friendly billionaire offers you a ride from new york to paris on his pj thats a quick ny way of saying private jet one is morally bound to say yes because that means the person you would have been sitting next to on the commercial flight now has two seats to themself which is a real luxury for them and when you get tired you can go sleep in the bedroom whereas however hard i look i have never found a bedroom on an american airlines 767 if someone elses comfort is at stake i say always take the private jet 3 tolerant if a girl is wearing last seasons manolo blahnik stilettos i wont immediately rule her out as a friend i mean you never know if a superdupernice person is lurking in a pastit pair of shoes some girls in new york are so ruthless they wont speak to a girl unless shes in next seasons shoes which is really asking a lot 4 common sense i really am fluent in it youve got to recognize it when a day is a total waste of makeup 5 english lit major everyone thinks its unbelievable that a girl who is as obsessed with chlo jeans as i am could have studied at princeton but when i told one of the girls at the baby shower about school she said oh my god ivy league youre like the female stephen hawking listen someone that brainy would never do something as crazy as spend 525 on a pair of chlo jeans but i just cant help it like most new york girls the reason i can just about afford the 325 jeans is because the aforementioned career consists of writing articles for a fashion magazine which say that spending 325 on a pair of jeans will make you deliriously happy ive tried all the other jeans rogan seven earl juicy blue cultbut i always come back to the classic chlo they just do something to your butt the others cant the other thing that helps fund my habit is if i dont pay my rent on my perry street apartment i often dont because my landlord seems to like being paid in other ways like if i let him come up for a triple espresso he reduces my rent by over 100 percent i always say waste not want not which is a terrible clich the british invented during the war to get kids to eat their wholewheat bread but when i say it i mean waste not money on boring old rent when it can be unwasted on chlo jeans 6 punctual i am up every morning at 105830 am and not a minute earlier 7 thrifty you can be frugal even if you have expensive tastes please dont tell a soul because you know some girls get so jealous but i hardly pay for a thing i wear you see fashion designers in new york love giving clothes away sometimes i wonder if fashion designers who i consider to be geniuses are actually thickos like lots of mean people are always saying they are isnt giving something away for nothing when you could sell it for something a bit stupid but there is something really really clever about this particular form of stupidity because fashion designertype people all seem to own at least four expensively decorated homes st barths aspen biarritz paris whereas all the clever people with regular jobs selling things for money only seem to own about one barely decorated house each so i maintain that fashion designers are geniuses because it takes a genius to make money by giving things away overall i can safely say that my value system is intact despite the temptations of new york which i regret to say have made some girls into very spoiled little princesses talking of princesses mimis shower was packed with the park avenue version everyone was there except oddly julie the biggest princess of them all the most glamorous girls were all working the 325chlojeans look they looked deliriously happy then there was another group who were working the harry winston engagement ring look and they seemed what i can only describe as beyond radiant jolene morgan carl phillips who had the biggest ring but then shed gotten a deal because her mom was a winston and kk adams were in this group soon they abandoned the main party for an engagementring summit in mimis bedroom which is so big an entire dorm could sleep in it everything in theres upholstered in dove gray chintz even the insides of her closets when i finally got poor george sorted out and off my cell i joined them jolene whos curvacious and blonde and pale and worships sophie dahl because she heard shes never sunbathed in her life has been engaged twice before i wondered how she could be sure this latest fianc was the right one oh easy ive got a new watertight method of selection if you use the same criteria to choose a man that you would when choosing a handbag i guarantee you will find one that suits you perfectly she explained jolenes theory is that a man has many wonderful things in common with a handbag like the fact that theres a wait list for the best ones some are two weeks college boys and ll bean totes some are three years funny men and alligator herms birkin bags even if you are on the list for the whole three years another woman with a superior claim can jump the line jolene says you have to hide a really sexy one or your best friend will borrow it without telling you her main concern is that without one a girl looks underdressed which makes it completely understandable that a girl may need to try out several styles of fianc before she finds one that really suits her concluded jolene maybe i had misjudged jolene morgan58 i secretly used to think she was one of the shallowest girls in new york but jolene has hidden depths when it comes to relationships sometimes you go to a baby shower expecting nothing more than a conversation about the advantages of a scheduled csection you can pick your kids birth sign and come away having learned a lot about life the minute i got home i emailed julie to58 juliebergdorfattglobalnet from58 moimoicom re58 happiness just got back from mimis baby shower darling where were you jolene k k and cari all engaged have detected glaring difference between chlo jeans happiness and engagement ring happiness this afternoon i mean have you any idea how awesome your skin looks if you are engaged julie bergdorf has been my best friend since the minute i met her at her mothers corner apartment in the pierre hotel on fifth and sixtyfirst she was an elevenyearold departmentstore heiress her greatgrandfather started bergdorf goodman and a whole chain of stores around america which is why julie says she always has at least 100 million in the bank and not a dime more as she puts it julie spent most of her teens shoplifting from bergdorfs after getting out of spence each day she still finds it hard not to see bergdorfs as her walkin closet even though most of it was sold to neiman marcus years ago the best thing she ever stole was a faberg egg encrusted with rubies that was once owned by catherine the great her excuse for her childhood hobby is that she liked nice stuff it must have been so icky being a woolworth kid i mean they used to have to shoplift like toilet cleaner but i got to take really glam stuff like handmade kid leather gloves julies favorite words are icky and glam julie once said she wished there was no ickiness in the world and i said to her if there was no ickiness there wouldnt be any glamour youve got to have the ickiness just for contrast she said oh like if there were no poor people then no one would be rich and i said well what i actually mean is if you were happy all the time how would you know you were happy she said because youd always be happy i said no you have to have unhappiness to know what happiness is julie frowned and said have you been reading the new yorker again julie thinks the new yorker and pbs are completely evil and boring and that everyone should read us weekly and watch the e channel instead our mothers were both mainline philadelphia wasps who had been best friends in the seventies i grew up in england because my dads english and everything about england is better according to mom but you dont get departmentstore heiresses in england and mom was very concerned that i should have one as a friend meanwhile julies mom thought i would be a civilizing influence on her daughter continues
