 now when i say i saw my dead mother i mean just that i saw her she was standing by the dugout wearing a lavender jacket holding her pocketbook she didnt say a word she just looked at me i tried to lift myself in her direction then fell back a bolt of pain shooting through my muscles my brain wanted to shout her name but there was no sound from my throat i lowered my head and put my palms together i pushed hard again and this time i lifted myself halfway off the ground i looked up she was gone i dont expect you to go with me here its crazy i know you dont see dead people you dont get visits you dont fall off of a water tower miraculously alive despite your best attempt to kill yourself and see your dearly departed mother holding her pocketbook on the thirdbase line i have given it all the thought that you are probably giving it right now a hallucination a fantasy a drunken dream the mixedup brain on its mixedup way as i say i dont expect you to go with me here but this is what happened she had been there i had seen her i lay on the field for an indeterminate amount of time then i rose to my feet and i got myself walking i brushed the sand and debris from my knees and forearms i was bleeding from dozens of cuts most of them small a few bigger i could taste blood in my mouth i cut across a familiar patch of grass a morning wind shook the trees and brought a sweep of yellow leaves like a small fluttering rainstorm i had twice failed to kill myself how pathetic was that i headed toward my old house determined to finish the job my father once told me you can be a mamas boy or a daddys boy but you cant be both so i was a daddys boy i mimicked his walk i mimicked his deep smoky laugh i carried a baseball glove because he loved baseball and i took every hardball he threw even the ones that stung my hands so badly i thought i would scream when school was out i would run to his liquor store on kraft avenue and stay until dinnertime playing with empty boxes in the storeroom waiting for him to finish we would ride home together in his sky blue buick sedan and sometimes we would sit in the driveway as he smoked his chesterfields and listened to the radio news i have a younger sister named roberta and back then she wore pink ballerina slippers almost everywhere when we ate at the local diner my mother would yank her to the ladies roomher pink feet sliding across the tilewhile my father took me to the gents in my young mind i figured this was lifes assignment me with him her with her ladies gents mamas daddys a daddys boy i was a daddys boy and i remained a daddys boy right up to a hot cloudless saturday morning in the spring of my fifth grade year we had a doubleheader scheduled that day against the cardinals who wore red wool uniforms and were sponsored by connors plumbing supply the sun was already warming the kitchen when i entered in my long socks carrying my glove and saw my mother at the table smoking a cigarette my mother was a beautiful woman but she didnt look beautiful that morning she bit her lip and looked away from me i remember the smell of burnt toast and i thought she was upset because she messed up breakfast ill eat cereal i said i took a bowl from the cupboard she cleared her throat what time is your game honey do you have a cold i asked she shook her head and put a hand to her cheek what time is your game i dunno i shrugged this was before i wore a watch i got the glass bottle of milk and the big box of corn puffs i poured the corn puffs too fast and some bounced out of the bowl and onto the table my mother picked them up one at a time and put them in her palm ill take you she whispered whenever it is why cant daddy take me i asked daddys not here where is he she didnt answer whens he coming back she squeezed the corn puffs and they crumbled into floury dust i was a mamas boy from that day on the house was musty and there was a faint sweet smell of carpet cleaner as if someone the caretaker we paid had recently shampooed it i stepped past the hallway closet and the banister we used to slide down as kids i entered the kitchen with its old tile floor and its cherrywood cabinets i opened the refrigerator because i was looking for something alcoholic by now this was a reflex with me and i stepped back there was food inside tupperware leftover lasagna skim milk apple juice raspberry yogurt for a fleeting moment i wondered if someone had moved in a squatter of some kind and this was now his place the price we paid for ignoring it for so long i opened a cabinet there was lipton tea and a bottle of sanka i opened another cabinet sugar morton salt paprika oregano i saw a dish in the sink soaking under bubbles i lifted it and slowly lowered it as if trying to put it back in place and then i heard something it came from upstairs charley again charley it was my mothers voice i ran out the kitchen door my fingers wet with soapy water charley what i remember most hiding on that back porch is how fast my breath left me one second i had been at the refrigerator dragging through the motions the next second my heart was racing so fast i thought no amount of oxygen could sustain it i was shaking the kitchen window was at my back but i didnt dare look through it i had seen my dead mother and now i had heard her voice i had broken parts of my body before but this was the first time i worried i had damaged my mind i stood there my lungs heaving in and out my eyes locked on the earth in front of me as kids wed called this our backyard but it was just a square of grass i thought about bounding across it to a neighbors house and then the door opened and my mother stepped outside my mother right there on that porch and she turned to me and she said what are you doing out here its cold now i dont know if i can explain the leap i made its like jumping off the planet there is everything you know and there is everything that happens when the two do not line up you make a choice i saw my mother alive in front of me i heard her say my name again charley she was the only one who ever called me that was i hallucinating should i move toward her was she like a bubble that would burst honestly at this point my limbs seemed to belong to someone else charley whats the matter youre all cut she was wearing blue slacks and a white sweater nowshe was always dressed it seemed no matter how early in the morningand she looked to be no older than the last time i had seen her on her seventyninth birthday wearing these redrimmed glasses she got as a present she turned her palms gently upward and she beckoned me with her eyes and i dont know those glasses her skin her hair her opening the back door the way she used to when i threw tennis balls off the roof of our house something melted inside of me as if her face gave off heat it went down my back it went to my ankles and then something broke i almost heard the snap the barrier between belief and disbelief i gave in off the planet charley she said whats wrong i did what you would have done i hugged my mother as if id never let her go
