 1 thieves freshman fall i think that everything or at least the part of everything that happened to me started with the roman architecture mixup ancient history was my first class of the day occurring after morning chapel and roll call which was not actually roll call but a series of announcements that took place in an enormous room with twentyfoothigh palladian windows rows and rows of desks with hinged tops that you lifted to store your books inside and mahogany panels on the walls8212one for each class since ault8217s founding in 18828212engraved with the name of every person who had graduated from the school the two senior prefects led roll call standing at a desk on a platform and calling on the people who8217d signed up ahead of time to make announcements my own desk assigned alphabetically was near the platform and because i didn8217t talk to my classmates who sat around me i spent the lull before roll call listening to the prefects8217 exchanges with teachers or other students or each other the prefects8217 names were henry thorpe and gates medkowski it was my fourth week at the school and i didn8217t know much about ault but i did know that gates was the first girl in ault8217s history to have been elected prefect the teachers8217 announcements were straightforward and succinct please remember that your adviser request forms are due by noon on thursday the students8217 announcements were lengthy8212the longer roll call was the shorter first period would be8212and filled with double entendres boys8217 soccer is practicing on coates field today which if you don8217t know where it is is behind the headmaster8217s house and if you still don8217t know where it is ask fred where are you fred you wanna raise your hand man there8217s fred everyone see fred okay so coates field and remember8212bring your balls when the announcements were finished henry or gates pressed a button on the side of the desk like a doorbell there was a ringing throughout the schoolhouse and we all shuffled off to class in ancient history we were making presentations on different topics and i was one of the students presenting that day from a library book i had copied pictures of the colosseum the pantheon and the baths of diocletian then glued the pictures onto a piece of poster board and outlined the edges with green and yellow markers the night before i8217d stood in front of the mirror in the dorm bathroom practicing what i8217d say but then someone had come in and i8217d pretended i was washing my hands and left i was third right before me was jamie lorison mrs van der hoef had set a podium in the front of the classroom and jamie stood behind it clutching index cards 8220it is a tribute to the genius of roman architects8221 he began 8220that many of the buildings they designed more than two thousand years ago still exist today for modern peoples to visit and enjoy8221 my heart lurched the genius of roman architects was my topic not jamie8217s i had difficulty listening as he continued though certain familiar phrases emerged the aqueducts which were built to transport water the colosseum originally called the flavian amphitheater mrs van der hoef was standing to my left and i leaned toward her and whispered 8220excuse me8221 she seemed not to have heard me 8220mrs van der hoef8221 then8212later this gesture seemed particularly humiliating8212i reached out to touch her forearm she was wearing a maroon silk dress with a collar and a skinny maroon belt and i only brushed my fingers against the silk but she drew back as if i8217d pinched her she glared at me shook her head and took several steps away 8220i8217d like to pass around some pictures8221 i heard jamie say he lifted a stack of books from the floor when he opened them i saw colored pictures of the same buildings i had copied in blackandwhite and stuck to poster board then his presentation ended until that day i had never felt anything about jamie lorison who was redhaired and skinny and breathed loudly but as i watched him take his seat a mild contented expression on his face i loathed him 8220lee fiora i believe you8217re next8221 mrs van der hoef said 8220see the thing is8221 i began 8220maybe there8217s a problem8221 i could feel my classmates looking at me with growing interest ault prided itself on among other things its teacherstudent ratio and there were only twelve of us in the class when all their eyes were on me at once however that did not seem like such a small number 8220i just can8217t go8221 i finally said 8220i beg your pardon8221 mrs van der hoef was in her late fifties a tall thin woman with a bony nose i8217d heard that she was the widow of a famous archaeologist not that any archaeologists were famous to me 8220see my presentation is8212or it was going to be8212i thought i was supposed to talk about8212but maybe now that jamie82128221 8220you8217re not making sense miss fiora8221 mrs van der hoef said 8220you need to speak clearly8221 8220if i go i8217ll be saying the same thing as jamie8221 8220but you8217re presenting on a different topic8221 8220actually i8217m talking about architecture too8221 she walked to her desk and ran her finger down a piece of paper i had been looking at her while we spoke and now that she had turned away i didn8217t know what to do with my eyes my classmates were still watching me during the school year so far i8217d spoken in classes only when i was called on which was not often the other kids at ault were enthusiastic about participating back in my junior high in south bend indiana many classes had felt like oneonone discussions between the teacher and me while the rest of the students daydreamed or doodled here the fact that i did the reading didn8217t distinguish me in fact nothing distinguished me and now in my most lengthy discourse to date i was revealing myself to be strange and stupid 8220you8217re not presenting on architecture8221 mrs van der hoef said 8220you8217re presenting on athletics8221 8220athletics8221 i repeated there was no way i8217d have volunteered for such a topic she thrust the sheet of paper at me and there was my name lee fiora8212athletics in her writing just below james lorison8212architecture we8217d signed up for topics by raising our hands in class clearly she had misunderstood me 8220i could do athletics8221 i said uncertainly 8220tomorrow i could do them8221 8220are you suggesting that the students presenting tomorrow have their time reduced on your behalf8221 8220no no of course not but maybe a different day or maybe8212i could do it whenever just not today all i8217d be able to talk about today is architecture8221 8220then you8217ll be talking about architecture please use the lectern8221 i stared at her 8220but jamie just went8221 8220miss fiora you are wasting class time8221 as i stood and gathered my notebook and poster board i thought about how coming to ault had been an enormous error i would never have friends the best i8217d be able to hope for from my classmates would be pity it had already been obvious to me that i was different from them but i8217d imagined that i could lie low for a while getting a sense of them then reinvent myself in their image now i8217d been uncovered i gripped either side of the podium and looked down at my notes 8220one of the most famous examples of roman architecture is the colosseum8221 i began 8220historians believe that the colosseum was called the colosseum because of a large statue of the colossus of nero which was located nearby8221 i looked up from my notes the faces of my classmates were neither kind nor unkind sympathetic nor unsympathetic engaged nor bored 8220the colosseum was the site of shows held by the emperor or other aristocrats the most famous of these shows was82128221 i paused ever since childhood i have felt the onset of tears in my chin and at this moment it was shaking but i was not going to cry in front of strangers 8220excuse me8221 i said and i left the classroom there was a girls8217 bathroom across the hall but i knew not to go in there because i would be too easy to find i ducked into the stairwell and hurried down the steps to the first floor and out a side door outside it was sunny and cool and with almost everyone in class the campus felt pleasantly empty i jogged toward my dorm maybe i would leave altogether hitchhike to boston catch a bus ride back home to indiana fall in the midwest would be pretty but not overly pretty8212not like in new england where they called the leaves foliage back in south bend my younger brothers would be spending the evenings kicking the soccer ball in the backyard and coming in for dinner smelling like boysweat they8217d be deciding on their halloween costumes and when my father carved the pumpkin he would hold the knife over his head and stagger toward my brothers with a maniacal expression on his face and as they ran shrieking into the other room my mother would say 8220terry quit scaring them8221 i reached the courtyard broussard8217s dorm was one of eight on the east side of campus four boys8217 dorms and four girls8217 dorms forming a square with granite benches in the middle when i looked out the window of my room i often saw couples using the benches the boy sitting with his legs spread in front of him the girl standing between his legs her hands perhaps set on his shoulders briefly before she laughed and lifted them at this moment only one of the benches was occupied a girl in cowboy boots and a long skirt lay on her back one knee propped up in a triangle one arm slung over her eyes as i passed she lifted her arm it was gates medkowski 8220hey8221 she said we almost made eye contact but then we didn8217t it made me unsure of whether she was addressing me which was an uncertainty i often felt when spoken to i kept walking 8220hey8221 she said again 8220who do you think i8217m talking to we8217re the only ones here8221 but her voice was kind she wasn8217t making fun of me 8220sorry8221 i said 8220are you a freshman8221 i nodded 8220are you going to your dorm right now8221 i nodded again 8220i assume you don8217t know this but you8217re not allowed in the dorm during classes8221 she swung her legs around righting herself 8220none of us are8221 she said 8220for byzantine reasons that i wouldn8217t even try to guess at seniors are allowed to roam but roaming only means outside the library or the mail room so that8217s a joke8221 i said nothing 8220are you okay8221 she asked 8220yes8221 i said and began to cry 8220oh god8221 gates said 8220i didn8217t mean to upset you here come sit down8221 she was patting the bench beside her and then she stood walked toward me set one arm around my back8212my shoulders were heaving8212and guided me toward the bench when we were sitting she passed me a blue bandanna that smelled of incense even through the blur of my tears i was interested by the fact that she carried this accessory i hesitated to blow my nose8212my snot would be on gates medkowski8217s bandanna8212but my whole face seemed to be leaking 8220what8217s your name8221 she said 8220lee8221 my voice was high and shaky 8220so what8217s wrong why aren8217t you in class or study hall8221 8220nothing8217s wrong8221 she laughed 8220for some reason i don8217t think that8217s true8221 when i told her what had happened she said 8220van der hoef likes to come off like the dragon lady god knows why maybe it8217s menopause but she8217s actually pretty nice most of the time8221 8220i don8217t think she likes me8221 8220oh don8217t worry it8217s still so early in the school year she8217ll have forgotten all about this by november8221 8220but i left in the middle of class8221 i said gates waved one hand through the air 8220don8217t even think about it8221 she said 8220the teachers here have seen everything we imagine ourselves as distinct entities but in their eyes we merge into a great mass of adolescent neediness you know what i mean8221 i nodded though i was pretty sure i had no idea i8217d never heard someone close to my own age talk the way she was talking 8220ault can be a tough place8221 she said 8220especially at first8221 at this i felt a new rush of tears she knew i blinked several times 8220it8217s like that for everyone8221 she said i looked at her and as i did i realized for the first time that she was very attractive not pretty exactly but striking or maybe handsome she was nearly six feet tall and had pale skin fine features eyes of such a washedout blue they were almost gray and a massive amount of long light brown hair that was a rough texture and unevenly cut in places in the sunlight there were glints of gold in it as we8217d been talking she8217d pulled it into a high loose bun with shorter pieces of hair falling around her face in my own experience creating such a perfectly messy bun required a good fifteen minutes of maneuvering before a mirror but everything about gates seemed effortless 8220i8217m from idaho and i was the biggest hayseed when i got here8221 she was saying 8220i practically arrived on a tractor8221 8220i8217m from indiana8221 i said 8220see you must be way cooler than i was because at least indiana is closer to the east coast than idaho8221 8220but people here have been to idaho they ski there8221 i knew this because dede schwartz one of my two roommates kept on her desk a framed picture of her family standing on a snowy slope wearing sunglasses and holding poles when i8217d asked her where it was taken she8217d said sun valley and when i8217d looked up sun valley in my atlas i8217d learned it was in idaho 8220true8221 gates said 8220but i8217m not from the mountains anyway the important thing to remember about ault is why you applied in the first place it was for the academics right i don8217t know where you were before but ault beats the hell out of the public high school in my town as for the politics here what can you do there8217s a lot of posturing but it8217s all kind of meaningless8221 i wasn8217t certain what she meant by posturing8212it made me think of a row of girls in long white nightgowns standing up very straight and balancing hardcover books on their heads gates looked at her watch a man8217s sports watch with black plastic straps 8220listen8221 she said 8220i better get going i have greek second period what8217s your next class8221 8220algebra but i left my backpack in ancient history8221 8220just grab it when the bell rings don8217t worry about talking to van der hoef you can sort things out with her later after you8217ve both cooled off8221 she stood and i stood too we started walking back toward the schoolhouse8212it seemed i was not returning to south bend after all at least not today we passed the roll call room which during the school day functioned as the study hall i wondered if any of the students were looking out the window watching me walk with gates medkowski
