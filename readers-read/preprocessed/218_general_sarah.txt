 the bridal blood sarai clumsily pushed aside the curtain that hung in the doorway and ran to the middle of the brick terrace that overlooked the womens courtyard dawn was breaking and there was just enough light for her to see the blood on her hands she closed her eyes to hold back the tears she did not need to look down to know that her tunic was stained she could feel the fine woollen cloth sticking wetly to her thighs and knees here it was again a sharp pain like a demons claw moving between her hips she stood frozen her eyes half closed the pain faded as suddenly as it had come sarai held out her soiled hands in front of her she should have implored inanna the almighty lady of heaven but no word passed her lips she was petrified fear disgust and denial mingled in her mind only a moment ago she had woken suddenly her belly ringed with pain and put her hands between her thighs into this blood that was flowing out of her for the first time the bridal blood the blood that creates life it had not come as she had been promised it would it was not like dew or honey it flowed as if from an invisible wound in a moment of panic she had seen herself being emptied of blood like a ewe under the sacrificial knife she had reacted like a silly child and now she felt ashamed but her terror had been so great that she had sat up moaning on her bed and rushed outside now in the growing light of day she looked at her bloodstained hands as if they did not belong to her something strange was happening in her body something that had obliterated her happy childhood at a stroke tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and all the days and years to come would be different she knew what awaited her what awaited every girl in whom the bridal blood flowed her handmaid sililli and all the other women in the household would laugh they would dance and sing and give thanks to nintu the midwife of the world but sarai felt no joy at that moment she wished her body was someone elses she took a deep breath the smell of the night fires floating in the cool air of early morning calmed her a little the coolness of the bricks beneath her bare feet did her good there was no noise in the house or the gardens not even the flight of a bird the whole city seemed to be holding its breath waiting for the sun to burst forth for the moment it was still hidden on the other side of the world but the ocher light that preceded it was spreading over the horizon like oil abruptly sarai turned and went back through the curtain into her bedchamber in the dim light it was just possible to make out the big bedstead where nisaba and lillu lay sleeping without moving sarai listened to her sisters regular breathing at least she had not woken them she advanced cautiously to her own bed she wanted to sit down but hesitated she thought of the advice sililli had given her change your tunic take off the sheet roll the soiled straw in it go to the door and take some balls of wool dipped in sweet oil wash your thighs and genitals with them then take some other balls scented with essence of terebinth and use them to absorb the blood all she had to do was perform a few simple actions but she couldnt she didnt know why but she couldnt bear even the thought of touching herself anger was beginning to replace fear what if nisaba and lillu discovered her and roused the whole household crying out across the mens courtyard quotsarai is bleeding sarai has the bridal bloodquot that would be the most disgusting thing of all why did the blood running between her thighs make her more adult why at the same time as she gained the freedom to speak was she going to lose the freedom to act for that was what was going to happen now in exchange for a few silver shekels or a few measures of barley her father could give her to a man a stranger she might have to hate for the rest of her days why did things have to happen that way why not another way sarai tried hard to dismiss this chaos of thoughts this mixture of sadness and anger but she couldnt she couldnt even remember a single word of the prayers sililli had taught her it was as if a demon had banished them from her heart and mind lady moon would be furious she would send down a curse on her anger and denial swept through her again she couldnt stay here in the dark but she didnt want to wake sililli once sililli took charge things would really start she had to flee to flee beyond the wall that enclosed the city perhaps as far as the bend in the euphrates where the labyrinth of the lower city and the reedy lagoons stretched over dozens of s that was another world a fascinating but hostile world and sarai wasnt brave enough to go there instead she took refuge in the huge garden which was full of a hundred kinds of trees and flowers and vegetables and surrounded by a wall that in places was higher than the highest rooms she hid in a tamarisk grove clinging to the oldest part of the wall where sun wind and rain had in places dissolved the stack of bricks and reduced it to a hard ocher dust when the tamarisks were in bloom their huge pink flowers spread like luxuriant hair over the wall and could be seen clear across the city they had become the distinguishing feature of the house of ichbi sumusur son of ella dumtu lord of ur merchant and highranking official in the service of king amarsin who ruled the empire of ur by the will of almighty ea quotsarai saraiquot she recognized the voices lillus piercing shriek and silillis more muted and anxious tones some of the handmaids had already searched the garden but finding nothing had gone away again silence returned except for the murmur of the water flowing in the irrigation channels and the chirping of the birds from where she was sarai could see everything but could not be seen her fathers house was one of the most beautiful in the royal city it was shaped like a hand enclosing a huge rectangular central courtyard which was reached through the main entrance at either end the courtyard was separated by two greenandyellow brick buildings open only for receptions and celebrations and by two smaller courtyards the womens and the mens the mens quarters with their white staircases overhung the temple of the familys ancestors the storehouses and the room where her fathers scribes worked while the womens chambers were built above the kitchens the handmaids dormitories and the chamber of blood both opened onto a broad terrace shaded by bowers of vines and wisteria with a view of the gardens the terrace allowed the men to join the women at night without having to cross the courtyards from her grove sarai could also see a large part of the city and towering over it like a mountain the ziggurat the sublime platform not a day went by that she did not come here to admire the gardens of the ziggurat they were a lake of foliage between earth and sky full of every flower and every tree the gods had sown on the earth from this riot of greenery emerged the steps covered in blackandwhite ceramics that led up to the sublime bedchamber with its lapis lazuli columns and walls there once a year the king of ur was united with the lady of heaven today though she had eyes only for what was happening in the house everything seemed to have calmed down sarai had the impression they had stopped searching for her when the handmaids had appeared earlier in the garden she had been tempted to join them but now it was too late for her to leave her hiding place with every hour that passed she was more at fault if anyone saw her in this state they would scream with fright and turn away shielding their eyes as if they had seen a woman possessed by demons it was unthinkable that she could show herself like this to the women it would be a blemish on her fathers house she had to stay here and wait until nightfall only then could she perform her ablutions in the gardens irrigation basin after that she would go and ask sililli for forgiveness with enough tears and enough terror in her voice to mollify her until then she had to forget her thirst and the heat that was gradually transforming the still air into a strange miasma of dry dust she stiffened when she heard the shouts quotsarai answer me sarai i know youre there do you want to die today with the shame of the gods on youquot she recognized the thick calves the yellowandwhite tunic with its black border instantly quotsililliquot quotwho else were you expectingquot the handmaid retorted in an angry whisper quothow did you manage to find mequot sililli took a few steps back quotstop your chatteringquot she said lowering her voice even more quotand come out of there right now before anyone sees youquot quotyou mustnt look at mequot sarai warned she emerged from the copse straightening up with difficulty her muscles aching from her long immobility sililli stifled a cry quotforgive her almighty ea forgive herquot sarai did not dare look sililli in the face she stared down at her short round shadow on the ground and saw her raise her arms to heaven then hug them to her bosom quotalmighty lady of heavenquot sililli muttered in a choked voice quotforgive me for having seen her soiled face and hands she is only a child holy inanna nintu will soon purify herquot sarai restrained herself from rushing into the handmaids arms quotim so sorryquot she said in a barely audible whisper quoti didnt do as you told me to i couldntquot she did not have time to say more a linen sheet was flung over her covering her from head to foot and silillis hands clasped her waist now sarai no longer needed to hold back and she leaned against the firm fleshy body of the woman who had not only been her nurse but had also been like a mother to her quotyes you silly little thingquot sililli whispered in her ear through the linen the anger gone from her voice the tremor of fear still there quotive known about this hiding place for a long time since the first time you came here did you think you could escape your old sililli in the name of almighty ea what possessed you did you think you could hide from the sacred laws of ur to go where to remain at fault your whole life oh my little girl why didnt you come to see me do you think youre the first to be afraid of the bridal bloodquot sarai wanted to say something to justify herself but sililli placed a hand on her mouth quotno you can tell me everything later nobody must see us here great ea who knows what would happen if you were seen like this your aunts already know youve become a woman theyre waiting for you in the chamber of blood dont be afraid they wont scold if you arrive before the sun goes down ive brought you a pitcher of lemon water and terebinth bark so you can wash your hands and face now throw your soiled tunic under the tamarisk ill come back later to burn it wrap yourself in this linen veil make sure you avoid your sisters or nobody will be able to stop those pests from going and telling your father everythingquot sarai felt silillis hand stroking her cheek through the cloth quotdo what i ask of you and hurry up about it your father must know nothing of your escapadequot quotsililliquot quotwhat nowquot sililli said quotwill you be there too in the chamber of blood i meanquot quotof course where else should i bequot washed and scented her linen veil knotted over her left shoulder sarai reached the womens courtyard without meeting a soul she had gathered all her courage to approach the mysterious door she had never gone anywhere near from the outside the chamber of blood was nothing but a long white wall with no windows that took up almost the entire space below the quarters reserved for the women ichbis wife sisters daughters female relatives and handmaids the door was cleverly concealed by a cane portico covered with a luxuriant ocherflowered bignonia so that it was possible to cross the womens courtyard in all directions without ever seeing it sarai went through the portico before her was a small double door of thick cedarwood the bottom half painted blue and the top half red the door of the chamber of blood sarai had only a few steps to take to open this door but she did not move invisible threads were holding her back was it fear like all girls her age she had heard many stories about the chamber of blood like all girls her age she knew that once a month women went and shut themselves in there for seven days during full moons they would gather there to make vows and petitions that could be said nowhere else it was a place where women laughed wept ate honey and cakes and fruit shared their dreams and secretsand sometimes died in agony occasionally through the thick walls sarai had heard the screams of a woman in labor she had seen women go in there happy with their big bellies and not come out again no men ever entered or even tried to peer inside anyone curious or foolhardy enough to do so would carry the stain of their offense down with them to the hell of ereshkigal but in truth she knew very little of what went on there she had heard the most absurd rumors whispered by her sisters and cousins unopened girls did not know what happened to those who entered the chamber of blood for the first time and none of the munus the opened women over divulged the secret her day had come who could go against the will of the gods sililli was right it was time she could not remain at fault any longer she must have the courage to open that door
