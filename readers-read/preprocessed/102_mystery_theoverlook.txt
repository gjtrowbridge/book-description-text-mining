 the call came at midnight harry bosch was awake and sitting in the living room in the dark he liked to think that he was doing this because it allowed him to hear the saxophone better by masking one of the senses he accentuated another but deep down he knew the truth he was waiting the call was from larry gandle his supervisor in homicide special it was boschs first call out in the new job and it was what he had been waiting for harry you up im up whos that you got playing frank morgan live at the jazz standard in new york thats george cables youre hearing now on piano sounds like all blues you nailed it good stuff i hate to take you away from it bosch used the remote to turn the music off whats the call lieutenant hollywood wants you and iggy to come out and take over a case theyve already caught three today and cant handle a fourth this one also looks like it might become a hobby it looks like an execution the los angeles police department had seventeen geographic divisions each with its own station and detective bureau including a homicide squad but the divisional squads were the first line and couldnt get bogged down on longrunning cases when a murder came with any sort of political celebrity or media attachment it was usually shuttled down to homicide special which operated out of the robberyhomicide division in parker center any case that appeared to be particularly difficult and timeconsuming mdash that would invariably stay active like a hobby mdash would also be an immediate candidate for homicide special this was one of those where is it bosch asked up on that overlook above the mulholland dam you know the place yeah ive been up there bosch got up and walked to the dining room table he opened a drawer designed for silverware and took out a pen and a small notebook on the first page of the notebook he wrote down the date and the location of the murder scene any other details i should know bosch asked not a lot gandle said like i said it was described to me as an execution two in the back of the head somebody took this guy up there and blew his brains out all over that pretty view bosch let this register a moment before asking the next question do they know who the dead guy is the divisionals are working on it maybe theyll have something by the time you get over there its practically in your neighborhood right not too far gandle gave bosch more specifics on the location of the crime scene and asked if harry would make the next call out to his partner bosch said he would take care of it okay harry get up there and see whats what then call me and let me know just wake me up everybody else does bosch thought it was just like a supervisor to complain about getting woken up to a person he would routinely wake up over the course of their relationship you got it bosch said bosch hung up and immediately called ignacio ferras his new partner they were still feeling their way ferras was more than twenty years younger and from another culture the bonding would happen bosch was sure but it would come slowly it always did ferras was awakened by boschs call but became alert quickly and seemed eager to respond which was good the only problem was that he lived all the way out in diamond bar which would put his eta at the crime scene at least an hour off bosch had talked to him about it the first day they had been assigned as partners but ferras wasnt interested in moving he had a family support system in diamond bar and wanted to keep it bosch knew that he would get to the crime scene well ahead of ferras and that would mean he would have to handle any divisional friction on his own taking a case away from the divisional squad was always a delicate thing it was a decision usually made by supervisors not by the homicide detectives on the scene no homicide detective worth the gold trim on his badge would ever want to give away a case that just wasnt part of the mission see you there ignacio bosch said harry ferras said i told you call me iggy everybody does bosch said nothing he didnt want to call him iggy he didnt think it was a name that matched the weight of the assignment and mission he wished that his partner would come to that realization and then stop asking him bosch thought of something and added an instruction telling ferras to swing by parker center on his way in and pick up the city car they were assigned it would add minutes to his arrival time but bosch planned to drive his own car to the scene and he knew he was low on gas okay see you there bosch said leaving names out he hung up and grabbed his coat out of the closet by the front door as he put his arms into it he glanced at himself in the mirror on the inside of the door at fiftysix years old he was trim and fit and could even stand to add a few pounds while other detectives his age were getting round in the middle in homicide special there was a pair of detectives known as crate and barrel because of their widening dimensions bosch didnt have to worry about that the gray had not yet chased all of the brown out of his hair but it was getting close to victory his dark eyes were clear and bright and ready for the challenge awaiting him at the overlook in his own eyes bosch saw a basic understanding of homicide work that when he stepped out the front door he would be willing and able to go the distance mdash whatever that entailed mdash to get the job done it made him feel as though he were bulletproof he reached across his body with his left hand to pull the gun out of the holster on his right hip it was a kimber ultra carry he quickly checked the magazine and the action and then returned the weapon to its holster he was ready he opened the door the lieutenant had not known a lot about the case but he had been right about one thing the crime scene was not far from boschs home he dropped down to cahuenga and then took barham across the 101 freeway from there it was a quick run up lake hollywood drive to a neighborhood of homes clustered on the hills surrounding the reservoir and the mulholland dam they were expensive homes he worked his way around the fenced reservoir stopping only for a moment when he came upon a coyote in the road the animals eyes caught the headlights and glowed brightly it then turned and sauntered slowly across the road disappearing into the brush it was in no hurry to get out of the way almost daring bosch to do something it reminded him of his days on patrol when he saw the same challenge in the eyes of most of the young men he encountered on the street after passing the reservoir he took tahoe drive farther up into the hills and then connected with the eastern terminus of mulholland drive there was an unofficial overlook of the city here it was posted with no parking and overlook closed at dark signs but these were routinely ignored at all hours of the day and night bosch pulled in behind the grouping of official vehicles mdash the forensics van and the coroners wagon as well as several marked and unmarked police cars there was an outer perimeter of yellow police tape surrounding the crime scene and inside this boundary was a silver porsche carrera with its hood open it had been sectioned off by more yellow tape and this told bosch that it was most likely the victims car bosch parked and got out a patrol officer assigned to the outer perimeter took down his name and badge number mdash 2997 mdash and allowed him under the yellow tape he approached the crime scene two banks of portable lights had been erected on either side of the body which was in the center of a clearing that looked down upon the city as bosch approached he saw forensics techs and coroners people working on and around the body a tech with a video camera was documenting the scene as well harry over here bosch turned and saw detective jerry edgar leaning against the hood of an unmarked detective cruiser he had a cup of coffee in his hand and appeared to be just waiting he pushed himself off the car as bosch came over edgar had been boschs partner once back when he had worked in hollywood division back then bosch was a team leader on the homicide squad now edgar was in that position been waiting on somebody from rhd edgar said didnt know it would be you man its me you working this solo no my partners on the way your new partner right i havent heard from you since that mess over in echo park last year yeah so what do you have here bosch didnt want to talk about echo park with edgar with anyone as a matter of fact he wanted to stay focused on the case at hand it was his first call out since his transfer to homicide special he knew there would be a lot of people watching his moves some of them would be people hoping he would fail edgar turned so that bosch could see what was spread out on the trunk of the car bosch took out glasses and put them on as he leaned in close to look there wasnt a lot of light but he could see an array of evidence bags the bags separately contained items taken from the body these included a wallet a key ring and a clipon name tag there was also a money clip with a thick fold of currency and a blackberry that was still on its green light flashing and ready to transmit calls its owner would never make or receive the coroners guy just gave me all of this edgar said they should be done with the body in about ten minutes bosch picked up the bag containing the id tag and angled it toward the light it said saint agathas clinic for women on it was a photograph of a man with dark hair and dark eyes it identified him as dr stanley kent he was smiling at the camera bosch noticed that the id tag was also a swipe key that could open locked doors you talk to kiz much edgar asked it was a reference to boschs former partner who had transferred after echo park to a management job in the ocp mdash the office of the chief of police not too much but shes doing fine bosch moved on to the other evidence bags and wanted to move the conversation away from kiz rider and onto the case at hand why dont you run down what youve got for me jerry he said happy to edgar said the stiff was found about an hour ago as you can see from the signs out on the street there is no parking up here and no loitering after dark hollywood always has a patrol swing by here a few times a night to chase lookyloos away keeps the rich locals up here happy i am told that house over there is madonnas or it was he pointed to a sprawling mansion about a hundred yards from the clearing the moonlight silhouetted a tower rising from the structure the mansions exterior was striped in alternating hues of rust and yellow like a tuscan church it was on a promontory that afforded anyone looking through its windows a magnificent sweeping view of the city below bosch imagined the pop star up in the tower looking down on the city that lay at her command bosch looked back at his old partner ready for the rest of the report the patrol car swings around about eleven and sees the porsche with the hood open engines in the back of those porsches harry it means the trunk was open got it okay so you knew that already anyway the patrol car pulls up they dont see anybody in or around the porsche so the two officers get out one of them walks out into the clearing and finds our guy hes facedown and has two in the back of the head an execution clean and simple bosch nodded at the id tag in the evidence bag and this is the guy stanley kent looks that way the tag and the wallet both say hes stanley kent fortytwo years old from just around the corner on arrowhead drive we ran the plate on the porsche and it comes back to a business called k and k medical physicists i just ran kent through the box and he came up pretty clean hes got a few speeding tickets on the porsche but thats it a straight shooter bosch nodded as he registered all the information you are going to get no grief from me taking over this case harry edgar said i got one partner in court this month and i left my other one at the first scene we caught today mdash a threebagger with a fourth victim on life support at queen of angels bosch remembered that hollywood ran its homicide squad in threeman teams instead of the traditional partnerships any chance the threebagger is connected to this he pointed to the gathering of technicians around the body on the overlook no thats a straight gang shootemup edgar said i think this thing is a whole different ball game and im happy for you to take it good bosch said ill cut you loose as soon as i can anybody look in the car yet not really waiting on you okay anybody go to the victims house on arrowhead no on that too anybody knock on any doors not yet we were working the scene first edgar obviously had decided early that the case would be passed to rhd it bothered bosch that nothing had been done but at the same time he knew it would be his and ferrass to work fresh from the start and that wasnt a bad thing there was a long history in the department of cases getting damaged or bungled while in transition from divisional to downtown detective teams he looked at the lighted clearing and counted a total of five men working on or near the body for the forensics and coroners teams well he said since youre working the crime scene first did anybody look for foot impressions around the body before you let the techs approach bosch couldnt keep the tone of annoyance out of his voice harry edgar said his tone now showing annoyance with boschs annoyance a couple hundred people stand around on this overlook every damn day we coulda been looking at footprints till christmas if wed wanted to take the time i didnt think we did we had a body lying out here in a public place and needed to get to it besides that it looks like a professional hit that means the shoes the gun the car everythings already long gone by now bosch nodded he wanted to dismiss this and move on okay he said evenly then i guess youre clear edgar nodded and bosch thought he might be embarrassed like i said harry i didnt expect it to be you meaning he would not have dogged it for harry only for somebody else from rhd sure bosch said i understand after edgar left bosch went back to his car and got the maglite out of the trunk he walked back to the porsche put on gloves and opened the driverside door he leaned into the car and looked around on the passenger seat was a briefcase it was unlocked and when he popped the snaps it opened to reveal several files a calculator and various pads pens and papers he closed it and left it in its place its position on the seat told him that the victim had likely arrived at the overlook by himself he had met his killer here he had not brought his killer with him this bosch thought might be significant he opened the glove box next and several more clipon ids like the one found on the body fell to the floorboard he picked them up one by one and saw that each access badge had been issued by a different local hospital but the swipe cards all bore the same name and photo stanley kent the man bosch presumed who was lying dead in the clearing he noticed that on the back of several of the tags there were handwritten notations he looked at these for a long moment most were numbers with the letters l or r at the end and he concluded that they were lock combinations bosch looked farther into the glove box and found even more ids and access key cards as far as he could tell the dead man mdash if he was stanley kent mdash had clearance access to just about every hospital in los angeles county he also had the combinations to security locks at almost every one of the hospitals bosch briefly considered that the ids and key cards might be counterfeits used by the victim in some sort of hospital scam bosch returned everything to the glove box and closed it he then looked under and between the seats and found nothing of interest he backed out of the car and went to the open trunk the trunk was small and empty but in the beam of his flashlight he noted that there were four indentations in the carpet lining the bottom it was clear that something square and heavy with four legs or wheels had been carried in the trunk because the trunk was found in the open position it was likely that the object mdash whatever it was mdash had been taken during the killing detective bosch turned and put the beam of his light into the face of a patrolman it was the officer who had taken his name and badge number at the perimeter he lowered the light what is it theres an fbi agent here shes asking permission to enter the crime scene where is she the officer led the way back to the yellow tape as bosch got close he saw a woman standing next to the open door of a car she was alone and she wasnt smiling bosch felt the thud of uneasy recognition hit his chest hello harry she said when she saw him hello rachel he said
