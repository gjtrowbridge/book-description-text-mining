 chapter 1 hes not deadbut watch out for the winged snake as she studied the tall young man lying unconscious on the fastmoving gurney the alert eyes of the duty physician at reides central narrowed what winged snake the harried medtech guiding the gurney gestured at the slow rise and fall of the patients chest its coiled up under his shirt between his left arm and his ribs squirmed in there and hid when we arrived to pick him up sticks its head out occasionally for a quick look around but thats all wont leave hasnt bothered anyoneso far almost as if it senses were trying to help the emergency sector physician nodded tersely as she continued to pace the gurney ill be sure and keep my fingers away why wasnt it caught and neutralized before the patient was brought in the medtech glanced sideways at her quickref says its an alaspinian minidrag they bond emotionally with their owners if youd heard what i was told you wouldnt get any ideas about trying to separate them they rounded a corner dodged an oncoming stasis chair and headed up another corridor hell of a way to practice medicine the doctor muttered to no one in particular like there arent enough obstacles put in our way she leaned slightly forward over the motionless form but she was unable to detect any movement in the indicated area its dangerous then the medtech smoothly eased the gurney into an empty monitoring chamber apparently only if you try to separate them or if it thinks youre trying to harm its master were trying to help him just like were trying to help all the others who were brought in as soon as the waiting sensors detected the gurneys presence a dozen different automated appliances initiated a standard preliminary patient scan they automatically disregarded the presence of the flying snake just as they ignored the basic but neat and clean clothing in which the patient was dressed the doctor stepped back from the gurney and examined her pad as one recording after another was made and silently transferred a duplicate set was simultaneously being entered into the official hospital files the medtech looked on thoughtfully want me to stay when the doctor glanced up from her softly glowing pad it was only to eye the patient up to you ill be careful of the snake now that she knew where it was she could see the slight bulge occasionally moving beneath the patients shirt if i have any problems ill alert security nodding the medtech turned to go suit yourself they probably need me in receiving now anyway the doctor continued speaking without looking at him how many all together twentytwo all standing walking or sitting within a few meters of one another in the same part of the reides shopping complex all displayed the same symptoms a sharp gasp followed by a rolling back of the eyes and down they wentout cold adults children males femalestwo thranx one tolian the rest human no external signs of injury no indication of stroke or myocardial infarction nothing as if theyd all simultaneously been put to sleep thats what the official witness reports say anyway theyre pretty consistent throughout she gestured absently itll take a minute or two for processing to finish admitting this one first thing well do is correlate data between patients for indications of other similarities so we can try and define some parameters id be surprised if there werent several her voice fell slightly thered better be halfway out the portal the medtech hesitated viral or bacterial infection nothing that contradicts it but its much too early to say she looked up from her pad to meet his gaze concern was writ large there and he was clearly looking for some sort of reassurance at a guess id say neither one the zone of influence was too sharply circumscribed same goes for a narcoleptic gas and there are no overt indicators that would indicate an airborne infectious agentno elevated or reduced blood pressure no respiratory problems no dermatological indications no dilated pupils not so much as a rash or a reported sneezing fit what then again its too soon to say some kind of areaspecific sonic projection maybe though theres no evidence of cochlear damage in any of the patients delineated flash hallucinogen cerebroelectrical interruptthere are numerous possibilities based on what ive read and seen so far id say the event was a sitespecific onetime event and that no organic agent is involved but thats a very preliminary assessment with a grateful nod the medtech departed as the portal opaqued behind him the doctor turned back to her patient other than being taller than average and discounting the presence of the alien pet he appeared no different from others who had been brought in she knew results were expected fast having twentytwo customers suddenly drop unconscious in ones place of business was not good publicity for any enterprise fortunately for reidess management everything had happened so quickly and the local emergency teams had reacted rapidly enough that the local media had not yet found their way to the hospital by the time they did she and her fellow consulting physicians hoped to be ready with some answers an attractive young man she decided with his red hair and olivehued skin tall slim and apparently healthy if one discounted his current condition she guessed him to be somewhere in his early twenties a universal command bracelet encircled one wrist but there was no sign of whatever specially attuned devices it might control probably nothing more elaborate than a vit player she decided if it contained usable ident and medical information the medtech had failed to tap into it well that could come later following the initial diagnosis the scanners would tell her everything she needed to know to prescribe treatment on the bracelet a single telltale glowed softly green showing that it was active beneath the patients shirt a ropy shape shifted position she did her best not to stare in its direction she knew nothing about alaspinian minidrags beyond the little the medtech had just told her as long as it did not interfere with her work she had no desire to know more she fidgeted waiting for the scanners to finish even though no serious trauma was involved the sudden influx of unconscious patients had momentarily overwhelmed the hospitals emergency staff she was already eager to move on to the next patient the preliminary readings began appearing on her pad as well as on the main monitor that projected from the wall heart rate hemoglobin content white cell count respiration temperature everything was well within normal accepted parameters if anything the readings suggested an exceptionally healthy individual cerebral scan indicated that the patient was presently engaged in active dreaming neural activity levels general brain scan she frowned checked her pad again her eyes rose to squint at the main monitor it was already scrolling through a list of possible allergies and finding none manually interrupting the process she used her pad to go back to the readout that had attracted her attention it now appeared on both her pad and the monitor as a separate insert the figures were wrong they had to be wrong so was the direct imaging there had to be something the matter with this rooms cerebral scanner if its results had been a little off she would have put it down to a calibration error but the readouts were so far out of line that she was concerned they could potentially compromise patient treatment for one thing the patients parietal lobesthe parts of the brain responsible for handling visual and spatial tasksappeared grossly swollen since according to the steadily lengthening list of benchmarks being provided by the instrumentation there was no neurobiological basis for such enlargement it had to be a scanner error however that did not account for the exceptionally heightened blood flow to all parts of the patients brain nor for what appeared to be some completely unrecognizable enzymatic and electrical activity furthermore although the frontal cortex was quite dense its apparent normality was hardly in keeping with the contrasting readouts for other portions of the cerebellum while many neurons were perfectly normal dense clusters of others scanned in certain parts of the brain were swollen so large and were so inundated with activity as to suggest a potentially fatal ongoing mutationpotentially because it was patently evident that the patient was still alive deeper probing soon discovered additional unnatural distortions including what appeared to be scattered small tumors of a type and extensive neural integration she had not previously encountered either in vivo or the medical literature she was not prepared to go beyond initial observation to render a formal interpretation of what she was seeing she was no specialist and these readings cried out for one capable of properly analyzing them that or a technician to repair and recalibrate the scanners she opted to seek the latters advice first bad scans made more sense than neurobiological impossibilities take those distinctive tumors for example by rights intrusive growths of such size and in such locations should have resulted in a serious degeneration of cognitive faculties or even death yet all correlating scans indicated normal ongoing physiological activity of course she couldnt be sure the patient was not an idiot until he woke up and started to respond all she knew was that for a dumb dead man he appeared to be in excellent shape
