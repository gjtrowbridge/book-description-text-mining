 chapter 1 at twentyfour the ambassador8217s daughter slept badly through the warm unsurprising nights she woke up frequently and even when sleep did come her body was rarely at rest thrashing and flailing as if trying to break free of dreadful invisible manacles at times she cried out in a language she did not speak men had told her this nervously not many men had ever been permitted to be present while she slept the evidence was therefore limited lacking consensus however a pattern emerged according to one report she sounded guttural glottalstoppy as if she were speaking arabic nightarabian she thought the dreamtongue of scheherazade another version described her words as sciencefictional like klingon like a throat being cleared in a galaxy far far away like sigourney weaver channeling a demon in ghostbusters one night in a spirit of research the ambassador8217s daughter left a tape recorder running by her bedside but when she heard the voice on the tape its death8217shead ugliness which was somehow both familiar and alien scared her badly and she pushed the erase button which erased nothing important the truth was still the truth these agitated periods of sleepspeech were mercifully brief and when they ended she would subside for a time sweating and panting into a state of dreamless exhaustion then abruptly she would awake again convinced in her disoriented state that there was an intruder in her bedroom there was no intruder the intruder was an absence a negative space in the darkness she had no mother her mother had died giving her birth the ambassador8217s wife had told her this much and the ambassador her father had confirmed it her mother had been kashmiri and was lost to her like paradise like kashmir in a time before memory that the terms kashmir and paradise were synonymous was one of her axioms which everyone who knew her had to accept she trembled before her mother8217s absence a void sentinel shape in the dark and waited for the second calamity waited without knowing she was waiting after her father died8212her brilliant cosmopolitan father francoamerican 8220like liberty8221 he said her beloved resented wayward promiscuous often absent irresistible father8212she began to sleep soundly as if she had been shriven forgiven her sins or perhaps his the burden of sin had been passed on she did not believe in sin so until her father8217s death she was not an easy woman to sleep with though she was a woman with whom men wanted to sleep the pressure of men8217s desires was tiresome to her the pressure of her own desires was for the most part unrelieved the few lovers she took were variously unsatisfactory and so as if to declare the subject closed she soon enough settled on one pretty average fellow and even gave serious consideration to his proposal of marriage then the ambassador was slaughtered on her doorstep like a halal chicken dinner bleeding to death from a deep neck wound caused by a single slash of the assassin8217s blade in broad daylight how the weapon must have glistened in the golden morning sun which was the city8217s quotidian blessing or its curse the daughter of the murdered man was a woman who hated good weather but most of the year the city offered little else accordingly she had to put up with long monotonous months of shadowless sunshine and dry skincracking heat on those rare mornings when she awoke to cloud cover and a hint of moisture in the air she stretched sleepily in bed arching her back and was briefly even hopefully glad but the clouds invariably burned off by noon and then there it was again the dishonest nursery blue of the sky that made the world look childlike and pure the loud impolite orb blaring at her like a man laughing too loudly in a restaurant in such a city there could be no grey areas or so it seemed things were what they were and nothing else unambiguous lacking the subtleties of drizzle shade and chill under the scrutiny of such a sun there was no place to hide people were everywhere on display their bodies shining in the sunlight scantily clothed reminding her of advertisements no mysteries here or depths only surfaces and revelations yet to learn the city was to discover that this banal clarity was an illusion the city was all treachery all deception a quickchange quicksand metropolis hiding its nature guarded and secret in spite of all its apparent nakedness in such a place even the forces of destruction no longer needed the shelter of the dark they burned out of the morning8217s brightness dazzling the eye and stabbed at you with sharp and fatal light her name was india she did not like this name people were never called australia were they or uganda or ingushetia or peru in the mid1960s her father max ophuls maximilian ophuls raised in strasbourg france in an earlier age of the world had been america8217s bestloved and then most scandalous ambassador to india but so what children were not saddled with names like herzegovina or turkey or burundi just because their parents had visited those lands and possibly misbehaved in them she had been conceived in the east8212conceived out of wedlock and born in the midst of the firestorm of outrage that twisted and ruined her father8217s marriage and ended his diplomatic career8212but if that were sufficient excuse if it was okay to hang people8217s birthplaces round their necks like albatrosses then the world would be full of men and women called euphrates or pisgah or iztacc237huatl or woolloomooloo in america damn it this form of naming was not unknown which spoiled her argument slightly and annoyed her more than somewhat nevada smith indiana jones tennessee williams tennessee ernie ford she directed mental curses and a raised middle finger at them all 8220india8221 still felt wrong to her it felt exoticist colonial suggesting the appropriation of a reality that was not hers to own and she insisted to herself that it didn8217t fit her anyway she didn8217t feel like an india even if her color was rich and high and her long hair lustrous and black she didn8217t want to be vast or subcontinental or excessive or vulgar or explosive or crowded or ancient or noisy or mystical or in any way third world quite the reverse she presented herself as disciplined groomed nuanced inward irreligious understated calm she spoke with an english accent in her behavior she was not heated but cool this was the persona she wanted that she had constructed with great determination it was the only version of her that anyone in america apart from her father and the lovers who had been scared off by her nocturnal proclivities had ever seen as to her interior life her violent english history the buried record of disturbed behavior the years of delinquency the hidden episodes of her short but eventful past these things were not subjects for discussion were not or were no longer of concern to the general public these days she had herself firmly in hand the problem child within her was sublimated into her sparetime pursuits the weekly boxing sessions at jimmy fish8217s boxing club on santa monica and vine where tyson and christy martin were known to work out and where the cold fury of her hitting made the male boxers pause to watch the biweekly training sessions with a clouseauattacking burt kwouk lookalike who was a master of the closecombat martial art of wing chun the sunbleached blackwalled solitude of saltzman8217s moving target shooting gallery out in the desert at 29 palms and best of all the archery sessions in downtown los angeles near the city8217s birthplace in elysian park where her new gifts of rigid selfcontrol which she had learned in order to survive to defend herself could be used to go on the attack as she drew back her golden olympicstandard bow feeling the pressure of the bowstring against her lips sometimes touching the bottom of the arrow shaft with the tip of her tongue she felt the arousal in herself allowed herself to feel the heat rising in her while the seconds allotted to her for the shot ticked down toward zero until at last she let fly unleashing the silent venom of the arrow reveling in the distant thud of her weapon hitting its target the arrow was her weapon of choice she also kept the strangeness of her seeing under control the sudden otherness of vision that came and went when her pale eyes changed the things she saw her tough mind changed them back she did not care to dwell on her turbulence never spoke about her childhood and told people she did not remember her dreams on her twentyfourth birthday the ambassador came to her door she looked down from her fourthfloor balcony when he buzzed and saw him waiting in the heat of the day wearing his absurd silk suit like a french sugar daddy holding flowers yet 8220people will think you8217re my lover8221 india shouted down to max 8220my cradlesnatching valentine8221 she loved the ambassador when he was embarrassed the pained furrow of his brow the right shoulder hunching up against his ear the hand raised as if to ward off a blow she saw him fracture into rainbow colors through the prism of her love she watched him recede into the past as he stood below her on the sidewalk each successive moment of him passing before her eyes and being lost forever surviving only in outer space in the form of escaping lightrays this is what loss was what death was an escape into the luminous waveforms into the ineffable speed of the lightyears and the parsecs the eternally receding distances of the cosmos at the rim of the known universe an unimaginable creature would someday put its eye to a telescope and see max ophuls approaching wearing a silk suit and carrying birthday roses forever borne forward on tidal waves of light moment by moment he was leaving her becoming an ambassador to such unthinkably distant elsewheres she closed her eyes and opened them again no he was not billions of miles away amid the wheeling galaxies he was here correct and present on the street where she lived he had recovered his poise a woman in running clothes rounded the corner from oakwood and cantered toward him appraising him making the easy judgments of the times judgments about sex and money he was one of the architects of the postwar world of its international structures its agreed economic and diplomatic conventions his tennis game was strong even now at his advanced age the insideout forehand his surprise weapon that wiry frame in long white trousers carrying not much more than five percent body fat could still cover the court he reminded people of the old champion jean borotra those few oldtimers who remembered borotra he stared with undisguised european pleasure at the jogger8217s american breasts in their sports bra as she passed him he offered her a single rose from the enormous birthday bouquet she took the flower and then appalled by his charm by the erotic proximity of his snappy crackle of power and by herself accelerated anxiously away fifteen8211love from the balconies of the apartment building the old central and east european ladies were also staring at max admiringly with the open lust of toothless age his arrival was the high point of their month they were out en masse today usually they gathered together in small streetcorner clumps or sat in twos and threes by the courtyard swimming pool chewing the fat sporting inadvisable beachwear without shame usually they slept a lot and when not sleeping complained they had buried the husbands with whom they had spent forty or even fifty years of unregarded life stooped leaning expressionless the old women lamented the mysterious destinies that had stranded them here halfway across the world from their points of origin they spoke in strange tongues that might have been georgian croatian uzbek their husbands had failed them by dying they were pillars that had fallen they had asked to be relied upon and had brought their wives away from everything that was familiar into this shadowless lotusland full of the obscenely young this california whose body was its temple and whose ignorance was its bliss and then proved themselves unreliable by keeling over on the golf course or face down in a bowl of noodle soup thus revealing to their widows at this late stage in their lives the untrustworthiness of existence in general and of husbands in particular in the evenings the widows sang childhood songs from the baltic from the balkans from the vast mongolian plains the neighborhood8217s old men were single too some inhabiting sagging sacks of bodies over which gravity had exerted far too much power others grizzlechopped and letting themselves go in dirty tshirts and pants with unbuttoned flies while a third jauntier contingent dressed sharply affecting berets and bow ties these natty gents periodically tried to engage the widows in conversation their efforts with yellow glints of false teeth and melancholy sightings of slickeddown vestiges of hair beneath the doffed berets were invariably and contemptuously ignored to these elderly beaux max ophuls was an affront the ladies8217 interest in him a humiliation they would have killed him if they could if they had not been too busy staving off their own deaths india saw it all the exhibitionist desirous old women pirouetting and flirting on the verandahs the lurking spiteful old men the antique russian super olga simeonovna a bulbous denimclad samovar of a woman was greeting the ambassador as if he were a visiting head of state if there had been a red carpet on the premises she would have rolled it out for him 8220she keeps you waiting mr ambassador what you gonna do the young i say nothing against just a daughter these days is more difficult i was a daughter myself who for me my father was like a god to keep him waiting unthinkable alas daughters today are hard to raise and then they leave you flat i sir am formerly mother but now they are dead to me my girls i spit on their forgotten names this is how it is8221
