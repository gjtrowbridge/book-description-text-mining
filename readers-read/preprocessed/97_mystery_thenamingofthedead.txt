 in place of a closing hymn there was music the who 8220love reign o8217er me8221 rebus recognized it the moment it started thunderclaps and teeming rain filling the chapel he was in the front pew chrissie had insisted he8217d rather have been further back his usual place at funerals chrissie8217s son and daughter sat next to her lesley was comforting her mother an arm around her as the tears fell kenny stared straight ahead storing up emotion for later earlier that morning back at the house rebus had asked him his age he would be thirty next month lesley was two years younger brother and sister looked like their mother reminding rebus that people had said the same about michael and him the pair of you the spitting image of your mum michaelmickey if you preferred rebus8217s younger brother dead in a shinyhandled box at the age of fiftyfour scotland8217s mortality rate that of a third world nation lifestyle diet genes8212plenty of theories the full postmortem hadn8217t come through yet massive stroke was what chrissie had told rebus on the phone assuring him that it was 8220sudden82218212as if that made a difference sudden meant rebus hadn8217t been able to say goodbye it meant his last words to michael had been a joke about his beloved raith rovers soccer team in a phone call three months back a raith scarf navy and white had been draped over the coffin alongside the wreaths kenny was wearing a tie that had been his dad8217s raith8217s shield on it8212some kind of animal holding a belt buckle rebus had asked the significance but kenny had just shrugged looking along the pew rebus saw the usher make a gesture everyone rose to their feet chrissie started walking up the aisle flanked by her children the usher looked to rebus but he stayed where he was sat down again so the others would know they didn8217t have to wait for him the song was only a little more than halfway through it was the closing track on quadrophenia michael had been the big who fan rebus himself preferring the stones had to admit though albums like tommy and quadrophenia did things the stones never could daltrey was whooping now that he could use a drink rebus had to agree but there was the drive back to edinburgh to consider the function room of a local hotel had been booked all were welcome as the minister had reminded them from the pulpit whiskey and tea would be poured sandwiches served there would be anecdotes and reminiscences smiles dabs at the eyes hushed tones the staff would move quietly out of respect rebus was trying to form sentences in his head words that would act as his apology i need to get back chrissie pressure of work he could lie and blame the g8 that morning in the house lesley had said he must be busy with the buildup he could have told her i8217m the only cop they don8217t seem to need officers were being drafted in from all over fifteen hundred were coming from london alone yet detective inspector john rebus seemed surplus to requirements someone had to man the ship8212the very words dci james macrae had used with his acolyte smirking by his shoulder di derek starr reckoned himself the heir apparent to macrae8217s throne one day he8217d be running gayfield square police station john rebus posed no threat whatsoever not much more than a year away from retirement starr himself had said as much nobody8217d blame you for coasting john it8217s what anyone your age would do maybe so but the stones were older than rebus daltrey and townshend were older than him too still playing still touring the song was ending now and rebus rose to his feet again he was alone in the chapel took a final look at the purple velvet screen maybe the coffin was still behind it maybe it had already been moved to another part of the crematorium he thought back to adolescence two brothers in their shared bedroom playing 45s bought down kirkcaldy high street 8220my generation8221 and 8220substitute8221 mickey asking about daltrey8217s stutter on the former rebus saying he8217d read somewhere that it had to do with drugs the only drug the brothers had indulged in was alcohol mouthfuls stolen from the bottles in the pantry a can of sickly stout broken open and shared after lightsout standing on kirkcaldy promenade staring out to sea and mickey singing the words to 8220i can see for miles8221 but could that really have happened the record came out in 821766 or 821767 by which time rebus was in the army must have been on a trip back yes mickey with his shoulderlength hair trying to copy daltrey8217s look and rebus with his military crew cut inventing stories to make army life seem exciting northern ireland still ahead of him they8217d been close back then rebus always sending letters and postcards his father proud of him proud of both the boys the spitting image of your mum he stepped outside the cigarette packet was already open in his hand there were other smokers around him they offered nods shuffling their feet the various wreaths and cards had been lined up next to the door and were being studied by the mourners the usual words would crop up condolence and loss and sorrow the family would be in our thoughts michael wouldn8217t be mentioned by name death brought its own set of protocols the younger mourners were checking for text messages on their phones rebus dug his own out of his pocket and switched it on five missed calls all from the same number rebus knew it from memory pushed the buttons and raised the phone to his ear detective sergeant siobhan clarke was quick to answer 8220i8217ve been trying you all morning8221 she complained 8220i had it switched off8221 8220where are you anyway8221 8220still in kirkcaldy8221 there was an intake of breath 8220hell john i completely forgot8221 8220don8217t worry about it8221 he watched kenny open the car door for chrissie lesley was motioning to rebus letting him know they were headed for the hotel the car was a bmw kenny doing all right for himself as a mechanical engineer he wasn8217t married had a girlfriend but she hadn8217t been able to make it to the funeral lesley was divorced her own son and daughter off on holiday with their dad rebus nodded at her as she got into the back of the car 8220i thought it was next week8221 siobhan was saying 8220i take it you8217re phoning for a gloat8221 rebus started walking toward his saab siobhan had been in perthshire the past two days accompanying macrae on a recon of g8 security macrae was old pals with tayside8217s assistant chief constable all macrae wanted was a look around his friend happy to oblige the g8 leaders would meet at gleneagles hotel on the outskirts of auchterarder nothing around them but acres of wilderness and miles of security fence there had been plenty of scare stories in the media reports of three thousand us marines landing in scotland to protect their president anarchist plots to block roads and bridges with hijacked trucks bob geldof had demanded that a million demonstrators besiege edinburgh they would be housed he said in people8217s spare rooms garages and gardens boats would be sent to france to pick up protesters groups with names like ya basta and the black bloc would aim for chaos while the people8217s golfing association wanted to break the cordon to play a few holes of gleneagles8217s renowned course 8220i8217m spending two days with dci macrae8221 siobhan was saying 8220what8217s to gloat about8221 rebus unlocked his car and leaned in to slide the key into the ignition he straightened again took a last drag on his cigarette and flicked the butt onto the roadway siobhan was saying something about a scene of crime team 8220hold on8221 rebus told her 8220i didn8217t catch that8221 8220look you8217ve got enough on your plate without this8221 8220without what8221 8220remember cyril colliar8221 8220despite my advancing years the memory8217s not quite packed in8221 8220something really strange has happened8221 8220what8221 8220i think i8217ve found the missing piece8221 8220of what8221 8220the jacket8221 rebus found that he8217d lowered himself onto the driver8217s seat 8220i don8217t understand8221 siobhan gave a nervous laugh 8220me neither8221 8220so where are you now8221 8220auchterarder8221 8220and that8217s where the jacket8217s turned up8221 8220sort of8221 rebus swung his legs into the car and pulled the door shut 8220then i8217m coming to take a look is macrae with you8221 8220he went to glenrothes that8217s where the g8 control center is8221 she paused 8220are you sure you should be doing this8221 rebus had started the engine 8220i need to make my apologies first but i can be there inside the hour will i have any trouble getting into auchterarder8221 8220it8217s the calm before the storm when you8217re driving through town look for the sign to the clootie well8221 8220the what8221 8220easier if you just come and see for yourself8221 8220then that8217s what i8217ll do scene of crime on their way8221 8220yes8221 8220which means word will get around8221 8220should i tell the dci8221 8220i8217ll let you decide8221 rebus had wedged the phone between his shoulder and his cheek so he could steer the mazelike course to the gates of the crematorium 8220you8217re breaking up8221 siobhan said not if i can help it rebus thought to himself cyril colliar had been murdered six weeks before age twenty he8217d been locked away on a fixed tenyear stretch for a vicious rape at the end of the sentence he8217d been released despite the reservations of prison warders police and social services they figured he was as big a threat as ever having shown no remorse denying his guilt despite dna evidence colliar had returned to his native edinburgh all the bodybuilding he8217d done in prison paid off he worked as a nighttime bouncer and daytime muscle his employer on both counts was morris gerald cafferty big ger was a villain of long standing in had been rebus8217s job to confront him about his latest employee 8220what do i care8221 had been the retort 8220he8217s dangerous8221 8220way you8217re hassling him would try the patience of a saint8221 cafferty swinging from side to side on his leather swivel chair behind his desk at mgc lettings anyone was slow with the weekly rent on one of cafferty8217s flats rebus guessed that was where colliar would take over cafferty owned minicabs too and at least three raucous bars in the less salubrious parts of town plenty of work for cyril colliar right up until the night he8217d turned up dead skull caved in the blow coming from behind pathologist figured he8217d have died from that alone but just to make sure someone had added a syringe of very pure heroin no indication that the deceased had been a user deceased was the word most of the cops on the case had used8212and grudgingly at that nobody bothered with the term victim nobody could say the words out loud8212 bastard got what he deserved 8212that wasn8217t the done thing these days didn8217t stop them from thinking it sharing it through eye contact and slow nods rebus and siobhan had worked the case but it had been one among many few leads and too many suspects the rape victim had been interviewed along with her family and her boyfriend from the time one word kept coming up in discussing colliar8217s fate 8220good8221 his body had been found near his car down a side street next to the bar where he8217d been working no witnesses no sceneofcrime evidence just the one curiosity a sharp blade had been used to slice away part of his distinctive jacket a black nylon bomber emblazoned with the phrase cc rider on the back this was what had been removed so that the white inner lining was revealed theories were in short supply it was either a clumsy attempt to disguise the deceased8217s identity or there had been something hidden in the lining tests had proved negative for traces of drugs leaving the police to shrug and scratch their heads to rebus it looked like a hit either colliar had made an enemy or a message was being sent to cafferty not that their several interviews with colliar8217s employer had been enlightening 8220bad for my reputation8221 was cafferty8217s main reaction 8220means either you catch whoever did it8221 8220or8221 but cafferty hadn8217t needed to answer and if cafferty got to the culprit first it would be the last that was ever heard of them none of which had helped the inquiry had hit a wall around the same time g8 preparations started focusing minds8212most of them driven by images of overtime pay8212elsewhere other cases had intruded too with victims8212 real victims the colliar murder team had been wound down rebus lowered his driver8217sside window welcoming the cool breeze he didn8217t know the quickest route to auchterarder he knew gleneagles could be reached from kinross so had headed that way a couple of months back he8217d bought a gps for the car but he hadn8217t got round to reading the instructions yet it lay on the passenger seat screen blank one of these days he8217d take it to the garage that installed the car8217s cd player an inspection of the backseat floors and trunk had failed to turn up anything by the who so rebus was listening to elbow instead8212siobhan8217s recommendation he liked the title track 8220leaders of the free world8221 stuck it on repeat the singer seemed to think something had gone wrong since the 821760s rebus tended to agree even coming at it from a different direction he guessed the singer would have liked more change a world run by greenpeace and the campaign for nuclear disarmament poverty made history rebus had been on a few marches himself in the 821760s before and after joining the army it was a way to meet girls if nothing else usually there was a party somewhere afterward these days though he saw the 821760s as the end of something a fan had been stabbed to death at a stones concert in 1969 and the decade had petered out the 1960s had given youth a taste for revolt they didn8217t trust the old order certainly didn8217t respect it he wondered about the thousands who would descend on gleneagles confrontation a certainty hard to imagine it in this landscape of farms and hillsides rivers and glens he knew that gleneagles8217s very isolation would have been a factor in its choice as venue the leaders of the free world would be safe there safe to sign their names to decisions that had already been made elsewhere on the stereo the band was singing about climbing a landslide the image stuck with rebus all the way to the outskirts of auchterarder he didn8217t think he8217d been there before all the same he seemed to know the place typical small scottish town a single welldefined main street with narrow side roads leading off built with the notion that people would walk to their local shops small independently owned shops at that he didn8217t see much that would inflame the antiglobalization campaigners the baker was even selling limitededition g8 pies the good folk of auchterarder rebus seemed to recall had been vetted under the guise of providing them with id badges these would be necessary so they could cross the eventual barricades yet as siobhan had pointed out there was an eerie tranquillity to the place only a few shoppers and one carpenter who seemed to be measuring windows for protective boards the cars were muddy 4x4s which had probably spent more time on farm tracks than motorways one woman driver was even wearing a head scarf something rebus hadn8217t seen in a while within a couple of minutes he was at the far end of town and heading toward the a9 he did a threepoint turn and this time kept his eyes open for signposts the one he wanted was next to a pub pointing down a lane he signaled following the road past hedges and driveways then a newer housing estate the landscape opened before him showing distant hills in moments he was out of town again flanked by neat hedgerows that would leave their mark on his car if he had to make way for a tractor or delivery van there were some woods to his left and another sign told him this was home to the clootie well he knew the word from clootie dumpling a sticky steamed dessert his mother had sometimes made he remembered the taste and texture as being similar to christmas pudding dark and cloying and sugary his stomach gave a small protest reminding him that he hadn8217t eaten in hours his stop at the hotel had been brief a few quiet words with chrissie she8217d hugged him just as she had back at the house earlier that morning all the years he8217d known her there hadn8217t been many hugs in the early days he8217d actually fancied her awkward under the circumstances she8217d seemed to sense this then he8217d been best man at the wedding and during one dance she8217d blown mischievously in his ear later on the few occasions when she and mickey had been separated rebus had taken his brother8217s side he supposed he could have called her said something but he hadn8217t and when mickey had gotten into that spot of bother ended up in jail rebus hadn8217t visited chrissie and the kids mind you he hadn8217t visited mickey that often either in jail or since there was more history when rebus and his own wife had separated chrissie had blamed him entirely she8217d always gotten on well with rhona kept in touch with her after the divorce that was family for you tactics campaigning and diplomacy the politicians had it easy by comparison back at the hotel lesley had mimicked her mother giving him a hug too kenny had thought for a second before rebus put the lad out of his misery by extending a hand to be squeezed he wondered if there would be any fallingsout there usually were at funerals with grief came blame and resentment just as well he hadn8217t stayed when it came to the potential for confrontation john rebus punched well above his already substantial weight there was a parking area just off the road it looked newly built trees having been cleared chippings of tree bark strewn across the ground room enough for four cars but only one was waiting siobhan clarke was leaning against it arms folded rebus pulled on the brake and got out 8220nice spot8221 he said 8220been here over a hundred years8221 she told him 8220didn8217t think i drove that slowly8221 she offered only a twist of the mouth leading him into the woods arms still folded she was dressed more formally than usual kneelength black skirt and black stockings her shoes were smudged from having walked this same trail earlier 8220i saw the sign yesterday8221 she was saying 8220the one leading off the main drag decided i8217d take a look8221 8220well if the choice was that or glenrothes8221 8220there8217s a bulletin board back at the clearing tells you a bit about the place all sorts of witchy goingson over the years8221 they were ascending a slope rounding a thick twisted oak 8220the townspeople decided there must be sprites living here shrieks in the dark that sort of thing8221 8220local farmhands more like8221 rebus offered she nodded agreement 8220all the same they started leaving little offerings hence the name clootie8221 she glanced around at him 8220you8217ll know what it means you being the only native scot around here8221 he had a sudden image of his mother lifting the pudding out of its pan the pudding wrapped in 8220cloth8221 he told her 8220and clothing8221 she added as they entered another clearing they stopped and rebus breathed deeply damp clothdamp rotting cloth he8217d been smelling it for the past half minute the smell clothes gave off in his old house the one he8217d grown up in when they weren8217t aired when the damp and the mildew got to them the trees around him were strung with rags and remnants pieces had fallen to the ground where they were decomposing to a mulch 8220tradition has it8221 siobhan said quietly 8220they were left here for good luck keep the sprites warm and they8217d see no harm came to you another theory when kids died young their parents left something here by way of remembrance8221 her voice caught and she cleared her throat 8220i8217m not made of glass8221 rebus assured her 8220you can use words like remembrance 8212i8217m not going to start blubbing8221 she nodded again rebus was walking around the clearing leaves and soft moss underfoot and the sound of a stream just a thin trickle of water pushing up from the ground candles and coins had been left by its edges 8220not much of a well8221 he commented she just shrugged 8220i was here a few minutesdidn8217t really warm to the atmosphere but then i noticed some of the newer clothing8221 rebus saw it too strung from the branches a shawl overalls a red polkadot handkerchief a nearly new sneaker its laces dangling even underwear and what looked like children8217s stockings 8220christ siobhan8221 rebus muttered not really knowing what else to say the smell seemed to be growing stronger he had another flashback to a tenday bender many years before coming out of it to find that a load of laundry had been sitting in the machine waiting to be hung when he8217d opened the door this same smell had hit him he8217d washed everything again but still had to throw it all away afterward 8220and the jacket8221 all she did was point rebus walked slowly toward the tree in question the piece of nylon had been pierced by a short branch it swayed just a little in the breeze threads straggling from it but no mistaking the logo 8220cc rider8221 rebus said in confirmation siobhan was running her hands through her hair he knew she had questions knew she would have been turning them over in her mind all the time she8217d been waiting for him 8220so what do we do8221 he prompted 8220it8217s a crime scene8221 she began 8220a team is on the way from stirling we need to secure the site comb the area for evidence we need to reassemble the original murder squad start going door to door locally82128221 8220including gleneagles8221 rebus interrupted 8220you8217re the expert so you tell me how many times has the hotel staff been vetted and how do we go about knocking on doors in the middle of a weeklong demonstration securing the site won8217t be a problem mind you not with all the secret service teams we8217re about to welcome8221 naturally she had considered all these points he knew as much and his voice trailed off 8220we keep it quiet till the summit8217s over8221 she suggested 8220tempting8221 he admitted she smiled 8220only because it gives you a head start8221 he admitted as much with a wink she sighed 8220macrae needs to be told which means he8217ll tell tayside police8221 8220but the socos are coming from stirling8221 rebus added 8220and stirling belongs to central region8221 8220so that8217s just the three police forces who need to knowshouldn8217t have any trouble keeping it under wraps8221 rebus was looking around 8220if we can at least get the scene checked and photographedtake the cloth back to the lab8221 8220before the fun and games start8221 rebus puffed out his cheeks 8220kicks off on wednesday right8221 8220the g8 does yes but there8217s the poverty march tomorrow and another planned for monday8221 8220in edinburgh though not auchterarder8221 then he saw what she was getting at even with the evidence at the lab the whole place could be under siege getting from gayfield square to the lab at howdenhall meant crossing the city always supposing the technicians had managed to force their way into work 8220why leave it here8221 siobhan asked studying the patch again 8220some sort of trophy8221 8220if so why here specifically8221 8220could be local any family connections with the area8221 8220i think colliar8217s solid edinburgh8221 she looked at him 8220i meant the rape victim8221 rebus formed his mouth into an o 8220something to consider8221 she added then she paused 8220what8217s that sound8221 rebus patted his stomach 8220been a while since i8217ve eaten don8217t suppose gleneagles is open for afternoon tea8221 8220depends on your credit card limit there are places in town one of us should stay for the socos8221 8220better be you then don8217t want accusations that i8217m hogging the limelight in fact you probably deserve a complimentary cup of aucherarder8217s finest tea8221 he turned to go but she stopped him 8220why me why now8221 her arms stretching from her sides 8220why not8221 he answered 8220just call it kismet8221 8220that8217s not what i mean8221 he turned toward her again 8220what i mean8221 she said quietly 8220is that i8217m not sure i want them caught if they are and it8217s because of me8221 8220if they are shiv it8217ll be due to their screwup8221 he stabbed a finger in the direction of the patch 8220that and maybe even a bit of teamwork8221 the scene of crime unit hadn8217t been thrilled by news that rebus and siobhan had entered the crime site prints of their shoes had been taken for purposes of elimination along with hair samples 8220go easy8221 rebus had warned 8220i can8217t afford to be generous8221 the soco8212scene of crime officer8212had apologized 8220got to get the root else we can8217t get the dna8221 on the third try with the tweezers he8217d been successful one of his colleagues had almost finished videoing the scene another was taking photographs and yet another was in conversation with siobhan about how much of the other clothing they should take to the lab 8220just the most recent8221 she told him her eyes on rebus he nodded his agreement sharing her train of thought even if colliar was a message to cafferty it didn8217t mean there weren8217t other messages here 8220sports shirt seems to have a company logo on it8221 the soco commented 8220your job could hardly be easier8221 siobhan said with a smile 8220my job8217s collection the rest is up to you8221 8220speaking of which8221 rebus interrupted 8220any chance this could all go to edinburgh rather than stirling8221 the soco stiffened his shoulders rebus didn8217t know him but he knew the type late forties half a lifetime8217s experience there was plenty of rivalry between the various police regions as it was rebus held up his hands in mock surrender 8220all i mean is it8217s an edinburgh case makes sense if they don8217t have to keep traipsing through to stirling every time there8217s something you need to show them8221 siobhan was smiling again amused by his use of they and them but she gave a slight nod too recognizing a useful ploy when she saw one 8220especially now8221 rebus was arguing 8220with the demonstrations and everything8221 he looked up to where a helicopter was circling gleneagles surveillance it had to be someone up there wondering at the sudden appearance of two cars and two unmarked white vans at the clootie well returning his gaze to the soco rebus realized the chopper had sealed the deal a time like this cooperation was paramount it had been hammered home in memorandum after memorandum macrae himself had said as much at the past dozen or so briefings at gayfield square be nice work together help each other because for these few short days the world would be watching maybe the soco had been at similar briefings he was nodding slowly turning away to continue his work rebus and siobhan shared another look then rebus reached into his pocket for his cigarettes 8220no traces please8221 one of the other socos warned him so rebus moved away back toward the parking lot he was just lighting up when another car appeared the more the merrier he thought to himself as dci macrae leaped out he was dressed in what looked like a new suit new tie too and a crisp white shirt his hair was gray and sparse face saggy nose bulbous and red veined he8217s the same age as me rebus thought why does he seem so much older 8220afternoon sir8221 rebus said 8220thought you were supposed to be at a funeral8221 the tone was accusatory as though rebus might have fabricated a death in the family to secure a friday sleepin 8220ds clarke interrupted proceedings8221 rebus explained 8220thought i8217d show my face8221 making it sound like a sacrifice the words worked too macrae8217s tightened jaw relaxed a little i8217m on a roll rebus thought first the soco now the boss macrae had been pretty good actually greenlighting a day off for rebus as soon as news broke of mickey8217s death he8217d told rebus to go get smashed and rebus had obliged8212the scotsman8217s way of dealing with death he8217d found himself in a part of town he didn8217t know no idea how he got there he walked into a drugstore and asked where he was answer colinton village pharmacy he8217d thanked them by making the purchase of some aspirin 8220sorry john8221 macrae said now taking a deep breath 8220how did it go8221 trying to sound concerned 8220it went8221 was all rebus said he watched the helicopter bank steeply as it turned for home 8220hope to christ that wasn8217t tv8221 macrae commented 8220not much to see even supposing it was shame to tear you away from glenrothes sir how8217s sorbus looking8221 operation sorbus the policing plan for g8 week to rebus it sounded like something a dieter would use in his tea instead of sugar siobhan had set him straight told him it was a kind of tree 8220we8217re prepared for any eventuality8221 macrae stated briskly 8220except maybe one8221 rebus felt it his duty to add 8220back burner till next week john8221 his boss muttered rebus nodded his agreement 8220always assuming they agree8221 macrae followed rebus8217s sight line and saw the car approaching it was a silver merc with tinted rear windows 8220probably means the chopper wasn8217t tv8221 rebus added for macrae8217s benefit he reached into his own car8217s passenger seat and brought out what remained of a sandwich ham salad the first had slipped down without touching the sides 8220the hell8217s this8221 macrae was asking through gritted teeth the merc had pulled to an abrupt stop beside one of the scene of crime vans the driver8217s door opened and a man got out he walked around the car and tugged open the rear passengerside door it took several moments for the man inside to emerge he was tall and narrow his eyes hidden behind sunglasses as he secured all three buttons of his suit coat he seemed to be studying the two white vans and the three unmarked police cars eventually he peered up at the sky mouthed something to his driver and stepped away from the vehicle instead of approaching rebus and macrae he walked over to the signpost the one informing tourists of the clootie well8217s history
