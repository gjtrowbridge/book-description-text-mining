 on the day his destiny returned to claim him ted mundy was sporting a bowler hat and balancing on a soapbox in one of mad king ludwigs castles in bavaria it wasnt a classic bowler more your laurel and hardy than savile row it wasnt an english hat despite the union jack blazoned in oriental silk on the handkerchief pocket of his elderly tweed jacket the makers greasestained label on the inside of the crown proclaimed it to be the work of messrs steinmatzky sons of vienna and since it wasnt his own hat as he hastened to explain to any luckless stranger preferably female who fell victim to his boundless accessibility neither was it a piece of selfcastigation its a hat of office madam he would insist garrulously begging her pardon in a set piece he had off perfectly a gem of history briefly entrusted to me by generations of previous incumbents of my post wandering scholars poets dreamers men of the cloth and every man jack of us a loyal servant of the late king ludwig hah the hah perhaps being some kind of involuntary throwback to his military childhood well whats the alternative i mean to say you can hardly ask a thoroughbred englishman to tote an umbrella like the japanese guides can you not here in bavaria my goodness no not fifty miles from where our own dear neville chamberlain made his pact with the devil well can you madam and if his audience as is often the case turns out to be too pretty to have heard of neville chamberlain or know which devil is referred to then in a rush of generosity the thoroughbred englishman will supply his beginners version of the shameful munich agreement of 1938 in which he does not shy from remarking how even our beloved british monarchy not to mention our aristocracy and the tory party here on earth favored practically any accommodation with hitler rather than a war british establishment absolutely terrified of bolshevism you see he blurts in the elaborate telegramese that like hah overcomes him when he is in full cry powersthatbe in america no different all any of em ever wanted was to turn hitler loose on the red peril and how in german eyes therefore neville chamberlains rolledup umbrella remains to this very day madam the shameful emblem of british appeasement of our dear fhrer his invariable name for adolf hitler i mean frankly in this country as an englishman id rather stand in the rain without one still thats not what you came here for is it you came to see mad ludwigs favorite castle not listen to an old bore ranting on about neville chamberlain what what been a pleasure madam doffing the clowns bowler in selfparody and revealing an anarchic forelock of saltandpepper hair that bounces out of its trap like a greyhound the moment its released ted mundy jester to the court of ludwig at your service and who do they think theyve met these punters or billies as the british tour operators prefer to call them if they think at all who is this ted mundy to them as a fleeting memory a bit of a comedian obviously a failure at something a professional english bloody fool in a bowler and a union jack all things to all men and nothing to himself fifty in the shade nice enough chap wouldnt necessarily trust him with my daughter and those vertical wrinkles above the eyebrows like fine slashes of a scalpel could be anger could be nightmares ted mundy tour guide its three minutes short of five oclock in the evening late may and the last tour of the day is about to begin the air is turning chilly a red spring sun is sinking in the young beech trees ted mundy perches like a giant grasshopper on the balcony knees up bowler tipped against the dying rays he is poring over a rumpled copy of the s252ddeutsche zeitung that he keeps rolled up like a dogchew in an inner pocket of his jacket for these moments of respite between tours the iraqi war officially ended little more than a month ago mundy its unabashed opponent scrutinizes the lesser headlines prime minister tony blair will travel to kuwait to express his thanks to the kuwaiti people for their cooperation in the successful conflict humph says mundy aloud brows furrowed during his tour mr blair will make a brief stopover in iraq the emphasis will be on reconstruction rather than triumphalism i should bloody well hope so mundy growls his glower intensifying mr blair has no doubt whatever that iraqs weapons of mass destruction will shortly be found us defense secretary rumsfeld on the other hand speculates that the iraqis may have destroyed them before the war began why dont you make up your stupid minds then mundy harrumphs his day thus far has followed its usual complex and unlikely course prompt at six he rises from the bed he shares with his young turkish partner zara tiptoeing across the corridor he wakes her elevenyearold son mustafa in time for him to wash and clean his teeth say his morning prayers eat the breakfast of bread olives tea and chocolate spread that mundy has meantime prepared for him all this is done in an atmosphere of great stealth zara works late shift in a kebab caf close to munichs main railway station and must not on any account be woken since starting her night job she has been arriving home around three in the morning in the care of a friendly kurdish taxi driver who lives in the same block muslim ritual should then permit her to say a quick prayer before sunrise and enjoy eight hours of good sleep which is what she needs but mustafas day begins at seven and he too must pray it took all mundys powers of persuasion and mustafas also to convince zara that mundy could preside over her sons devotions and she could get her hours in mustafa is a quiet catlike child with a cap of black hair scared brown eyes and a raucous boingboing voice from the apartment block a shabby box of weeping concrete and external wiring man and boy pick their way across wasteland to a bus shelter covered in graffiti much of it abusive the block is what these days is called an ethnic village kurds yemenis and turks live packed together in it other children are already assembled here some with mothers or fathers it would be reasonable for mundy to consign mustafa to their care but he prefers to ride with him to the school and shake his hand at the gates sometimes formally kissing him on both cheeks in the twilight time before mundy appeared in his life mustafa suffered humiliation and fear he needs rebuilding returning from school to the apartment takes twenty minutes of mundys huge strides and he arrives with one half of him hoping zara is still asleep and the other half that she is just awake in which case she will make at first drowsy then increasingly passionate love with him before he leaps into his elderly volkswagen beetle and joins the southbound traffic for the seventyminute drive to the linderhof and work the journey is irksome but necessary a year ago all three members of the family were separately in despair today they are a fighting force bent upon improving their collective lives the story of how this miracle came about is one that mundy recounts to himself whenever the traffic threatens to drive him mad he is on his uppers again he is practically on the run egon his business partner and coprincipal of their struggling academy of professional english has fled with the last of the assets mundy himself has been obliged to creep out of heidelberg at dead of night with whatever he can cram into the volkswagen plus 704 euros of petty cash that egon has carelessly left unstolen in the safe arriving in munich with the dawn he leaves the volkswagen with its heidelberg registration in a discreet corner of a parking garage in case his creditors have served an order on it then he does what he always does when life is closing in on him he walks and because all his life for reasons far back in his childhood he has had a natural leaning towards ethnic diversity his feet lead him almost of their own accord to a street full of turkish shops and cafs that are just beginning to wake up the day is sunny he is hungry he selects a caf233 at random lowers his long body cautiously onto a plastic chair that refuses to sit still on the uneven pavement and asks the waiter for a large mediumsweet turkish coffee and two poppyseed rolls with butter and jam he has barely begun his breakfast when a young woman settles on the chair beside him and with her hand held half across her mouth asks him in a faltering turkishbavarian accent whether he would like to go to bed with her for money zara is in her late twenties and improbably inconsolably beautiful she wears a thin blue blouse and black brassi232re and a black skirt skimpy enough to display her bare thighs she is dangerously slim mundy wrongly assumes drugs it is also to his later shame that for longer than he cares to admit he is half inclined to take her up on her offer he is sleepless jobless womanless and near enough penniless but when he takes a closer look at the young woman he is proposing to sleep with he is conscious of such desperation in her stare and such intelligence behind her eyes and such a lack of confidence on her part that he quickly takes a hold of himself and instead offers her breakfast which she warily accepts on condition she may take half of it home to her sick mother mundy now hugely grateful to be in contact with a fellow human being in low water has a better suggestion she shall eat all the breakfast and they will together buy food for her mother at one of the halal shops up and down the road she hears him without expression eyes downcast desperately empathizing with her mundy suspects she is asking herself whether he is just crazy or seriously weird he strains to appear neither of these things to her but patently fails in a gesture that goes straight to his heart she draws her food with both hands to her own side of the table in case he means to take it back in doing so she reveals her mouth her four front teeth are sheared off at the root while she eats he scans the street for a pimp she doesnt seem to have one perhaps the caf233 owns her he doesnt know but his instincts are already protective as they rise to leave it becomes apparent to zara that her head barely reaches up to mundys shoulder for she starts away from him in alarm he adopts his tall mans stoop but she keeps her distance from him she is by now his sole concern in life his problems are negligible by comparison with hers in the halal shop under his urgent entreaty she buys a piece of lamb apple tea couscous fruit honey vegetables halva and a giant triangular bar of toblerone chocolate on sale how many mothers have you got actually he asks her cheerfully but its not a joke she shares shopping she remains tense and tightlipped haggling in turkish from behind her hand then stabbing her finger at the fruit not this one that one the speed and skill with which she calculates impress him deeply he may be many kinds of man but he is no sort of negotiator when he tries to carry the shopping bags there are two by now both weighty she fights them from him in fierce tugs you want sleep with me she asks again impatiently when she has them safely in her hands her message is clear youve paid for me so take me and leave me alone no he replies what you want to see you safely home she shakes her head vigorously not home hotel he tries to explain that his purposes are friendly rather than sexual but she is too tired to listen to him and begins weeping without changing her facial expression he chooses another caf233 and they sit down her tears keep rolling but she ignores them he presses her to talk about herself and she does so without any particular interest in her subject she seems to have no barriers left she is a country girl from the plains of adana the eldest daughter of a farming family she tells him in her faltering bavarian argot while she stares at the table her father promised her in marriage to the son of a neighboring farmer the boy was held up as a computer genius earning good money in germany when he came home to visit the family in adana there was a traditional wedding feast the two farms were declared to be joined and zara returned to munich with her husband only to discover he was not a computer genius at all but a fulltime roundtheclock armed bandit he was twentyfour she was seventeen and expecting a child by him it was gang she declares simply all boys were bad crooks they are crazy steal cars sell drugs make nightclubs control prostitutes they do all bad things now he is in prison if he would not be in prison my brothers will kill him her husband had been sent to prison nine months ago but had found time to terrify the wits out of his son and smash his wifes face in before he went a sevenyear sentence other charges pending one of the gang turned police witness her story continues in a monotonous flow as they walk through the town now in german now in snatches of turkish when her german fails her sometimes he wonders whether she knows he is still beside her mustafa she says when he asks the boys name she has asked him nothing about himself she is carrying the shopping bags and he makes no further attempt to carry them for her she is wearing blue beads and he remembers from somewhere far back in his life that for superstitious muslims blue beads ward off the evil eye she is sniffing but the tears are no longer rolling down her cheeks he guesses she has made herself cheer up before meeting someone who mustnt know she has been crying they are in munichs westend which hardly accords with its elegant london equivalent drab prewar apartment houses in old grays and browns washing hanging out to dry in the windows kids playing on a patch of molting grass a boy sees their approach breaks free of his friends picks up a rock and advances on them menacingly zara calls to him in turkish what do you want the boy yells a piece of your toblerone please mustafa mundy says the boy stares at him talks again to his mother then edges forward keeping the rock in his right hand while he pokes in the bags with his left like his mother he is gaunt with shadowed eyes like his mother he seems to have no emotions left and a cup of apple tea mundy adds with you and all your friends led by mustafa who is by now carrying the bags and escorted by three stalwart darkeyed boys mundy follows zara up three flights of grimy stone stairs they reach a steellined door mustafa delves inside his shirt and with a proprietorial air pulls out a door key on a chain he steps into the house accompanied by his friends zara steps after them mundy waits to be invited you will please come in mustafa announces in good bavarian you will be most welcome but if you touch my mother we shall kill you for the next ten weeks mundy sleeps on mustafas sofa bed in the living room with his legs hanging over the end while mustafa sleeps with his mother keeping a baseball bat beside him in case mundy tries anything on at first mustafa refuses to go to school so mundy takes him to the zoo and plays ball games with him on the molting grass while zara stays home and lapses gradually into a state of convalescence which is mundys hope bit by bit he assumes the role of secular father to a muslim child and platonic guardian to a traumatized woman in a state of religious shame the neighbors initially suspicious of this gangling english intruder who laughs so much begin to tolerate him while mundy for his part does everything he can to separate himself from his countrys hated colonialist reputation for money they use the rest of his seven hundred euros and the pittance that zara receives from her turkish family and german social security in the evenings she likes to cook and mundy plays kitchen boy to her at first she objects to this then grudgingly allows it cooking together becomes the main event of the day her rare laughter is like gods gift to him broken teeth and all her lifes ambition he learns is to qualify as a nurse a morning comes when mustafa announces that he will go to school mundy escorts him and is proudly introduced by mustafa as his new father the same week all three make their first appearance together at the mosque expecting a gilded dome and a minaret mundy is startled to find himself in a tiled room on an upper floor of a downatheel house sandwiched between bridal costumiers halal shops and stores selling used electrical goods from his past he remembers that he mustnt point his feet at anyone or shake hands with women but place his right hand over his heart and drop his head in respect with zara consigned to the womens room mustafa takes his hand guides him to the mens prayerline and instructs him when to stand when to make an obeisance and when to kneel and press his brow to the strip of rush matting that does duty for the soil mustafas gratification in mundy is immense until now he has been obliged to sit upstairs with his mother and the younger kids thanks to mundy he is now downstairs with the men when prayers are over mustafa and mundy may now shake hands with all the men around them while each expresses the hope that the others prayers have found a good reception in heaven study and god will make you wise the enlightened young imam advises mundy as he leaves if you do not study you will become the victim of dangerous ideologies you are married to zara i believe mundy has the grace to blush and mutters something about well hope to one day the formality is not important the young imam assures him responsibility is all be responsible and god will reward you a week later zara gets herself a night job at the kebab caf233 by the station the manager having failed to go to bed with her decides instead to depend on her she wears the scarf and becomes his star employee allowed to handle cash and protected by a very tall englishman a couple more weeks and mundy too finds himself a place in the world as english tour guide at the linderhof next day zara pays a solitary visit to the enlightened young imam and his wife returning she closets herself for an hour alone with mustafa the same night mustafa and mundy exchange beds mundy has known stranger passages in his life but none he is convinced has filled him with such satisfaction his love for zara knows no bounds he loves mustafa no less and loves him best for loving his mother the english spoken cattle pen is opening the usual multicultural gaggle of sightseers shuffles forward canadians with red maple leaves on their backpacks finns in anoraks and tartan golf caps indian women in saris australian sheep farmers with airdried wives japanese elders who grimace at him with a pain he has never learned the source of mundy knows them all by heart from the colors of their tour buses to the first names of their rapacious minders who wish only to lure them to the gift shops for the greater good of their commissions all that is missing from this evenings mix is platoons of midwestern teenagers with barbed wire round their teeth but america is celebrating its victory over evil at home to the dismay of the german tourist industry removing his bowler and brandishing it above his head mundy places himself at the front of his flock and leads the march to the main entrance in his other hand he clutches a homebuilt soapbox of marine plywood that he has knocked together in the boiler room beneath the apartment block other guides employ the staircase as a speakers platform not ted mundy our hyde park corner orator plonking the box at his feet he steps smartly onto it to reappear taller than his audience by eighteen inches the bowler once more aloft english speakers to me then please thank you english listeners i should be saying though by this time in the day i wish you were the speakers hah not true really the voice kept deliberately low at this stage so that they have to quiet down to hear him not running out of steam yet i promise you cameras welcome ladies and gents but no videos please thats you too please sir thank you dont ask me why but my masters assure me that the merest whiff of a video camera will land us in the intellectualproperty courts the normal penalty is a public hanging no laughter but he doesnt expect it yet from an audience that has spent the last four hours wedged into a bus and another hour queuing in the heat of the sun gather round me please ladies and gentlemen a little closer if you will plenty of room here in front of me ladies to a bunch of earnest schoolmistresses from sweden can you hear me over there young sirs to a clutch of bony teenagers from across the invisible border to saxony who have wandered into the wrong pen by mistake but have decided to stay and get a free english lesson you can good and can you see me sir to a diminutive chinese gentleman you can one personal request if you dont mind ladies and gents handies as we call them here in germany known otherwise as your mobile telephones kindly make sure theyre switched off all done then perhaps the last one in will close those doors behind you sir and ill begin thank you the sunlight is cut off an artificial dusk is lit by myriad candlebulbs reflected in gilt mirrors mundys finest moment one of eight in every working day is about to begin as the most observant among you will see we are standing in the relatively modest entrance hall of the linderhof not linderhof palace please because hof here means farm and the palace where we are standing was built on the land where the linder farm once stood but why linder we ask ourselves do we have a philologist among us a professor of words an expert on the old meanings we do not which is as well because mundy is about to embark on one of his illicit improvisations for reasons that escape him he never seems quite to have got his head round the plot or perhaps its a blind spot he has sometimes he takes himself by surprise which is part of the therapy when he is fighting other more persistent thoughts such as iraq or a threatening letter from his heidelberg bank which this morning coincided with a demand note from the insurance company well now we do have the german word linde meaning a lime tree but does that explain the r i ask myself hes flying now mind you the farm may just have belonged to mr linder and thats the end of it but i prefer a different explanation which is the verb lindern to relieve to alleviate to assuage to soothe and i like to think its the interpretation that appealed most to our poor king ludwig if only subliminally the linderhof was his soothing place well we all need a bit of soothing dont we especially these days ludwig had had a rough deal remember he was nineteen when he took the throne he was tyrannized by his father persecuted by his tutors bullied by bismarck cheated by his courtiers victimized by corrupt politicians robbed of his dignity as a king and he hardly knew his mother has mundy been similarly mistreated by the throb in his voice you would believe so so what does he do this handsome overtall sensitive abused proud young man who believes he was appointed by god to rule he asks with all the pained authority of one overtall man empathizing with another what does he do when he is systematically stripped bit by bit of the power he was born to answer he builds himself a string of fantasy castles and who wouldnt warming to his subject palaces with attitude illusions of power the less power hes got the bigger the illusions he builds rather like my gallant prime minister mr blair if you want my opinion but dont quote me bemused silence and thats why personally i try not to call ludwig mad the king of dreamers is what i prefer to call him the king of escape artists if you like a lonely visionary in a lousy world he lived at night as you probably know didnt like people on the whole and certainly not the ladies oh dear me no the laughter this time comes from a group of russians who are passing a bottle between them but mundy prefers not to hear them raised on his homemade soapbox his bowler hat tilted slightly forward guardsstyle over his unmanageable mop of hair he has entered a sphere as rarefied as king ludwigs only seldom does he bestow a glance on the upturned heads below him or pause to let a child bawl or a bunch of italians resolve a private disagreement when ludwig was inside his own head he was ruler of the universe nobody but nobody gave him orders here at the linderhof he was the reincarnation of the sun king that bronze gentleman you see riding his horse on the table louis in french is ludwig in german and at herrenchiemsee a few miles from here he built his very own versailles at neuschwanstein up the road he was siegfried the great german medieval kingwarrior immortalized in opera by ludwigs idol richard wagner and high up in the mountains if youre feeling athletic he built the palace of schachen where he duly crowned himself king of morocco hed have been michael jackson if he could but fortunately he hadnt heard of him laughter from round the room by now but once again mundy ignores it and his majesty had his little ways he had his food put on a gold table and sent up to him through a hole in the floor which in a minute im going to show you so that nobody could watch him eat he kept the servants up all night and if they annoyed him hed order them to be flayed alive if he had one of his antisocial moods on him hed talk to you from behind a screen and kindly bear in mind please that all this is happening in the nineteenth century not the dark ages out there in the real world theyre building railways and iron ships and steam engines and machine guns and cameras so dont lets fool ourselves that this is longlongago and onceuponatime except for ludwig of course ludwig had put his life into reverse he was going back into history just as fast as his money would carry him which was the problem because it was also bavarias money a downward peek at his wristwatch three and a half minutes gone by now he should be walking up the staircase his audience trailing after him he is through adjoining walls he can hear the voices of his colleagues raised like his own boisterous frau doktor blankenheim retired teacher recent buddhist convert and doyenne of the reading circle pallid herr stettler cyclist and erotomane michel delarge from alsace unfrocked priest and behind him coming up the stairs wave after wave of invincible japanese infantry led by a tightstepping nipponese beauty queen brandishing a puce umbrella that is a far cry from neville chamberlains and somewhere close to him and not for the first time in his life the ghost of sasha is it here on the staircase that mundy first feels the familiar prickle on his back in the throne room in the royal bedchamber in the hall of mirrors where does the awareness like an old premonition steal over him a hall of mirrors is a deliberate bastion against reality multiplied images of reality lose their impact as they recede into infinity a figure who face to face might instill stark fear or perfect pleasure becomes in his numberless reflections a mere premise a putative form besides which mundy is by necessity and training a most watchful man here in the linderhof he does not undertake the simplest maneuver without checking his back and front and all the other approaches to him either for unwelcome traces of previous lives or for errant members of his present one such as art thieves vandals pickpockets creditors writservers from heidelberg senile tourists struck down by heart attacks children vomiting on priceless carpets ladies with small dogs concealed in their handbags and latterly on the urgent insistence of the management suicidally disposed terrorists nor must we exclude from this roll of honor the welcome relief even to a man so happily paired of a shapely girl whose attributes are best appreciated indirectly to assist him in this vigil mundy has covertly appointed certain vantage points or static posts here a dark painting conveniently glazed that looks backward down the stairs there a bronze urn that supplies a wideangle image of whoever is to either side of him and now the hall of mirrors itself where a multitude of replicated sashas hovers in miles and miles of golden corridor or not is he but a sasha of the mind a fridaynight mirage mundy has seen his share of almostsashas in the years since they took leave of one another as he is quick to remind himself sashas down to their last euro who spot him from across the street and spidery with hunger and enthusiasm come hobbling through traffic to embrace him prosperous sleek sashas with fur on their coat collars who wait artfully in doorways to spring out at him or clatter down public stairways yelling teddy teddy its your old friend sasha yet no sooner does mundy stop and turn his smile faithfully aloft than the apparition has vanished or transmuting itself into an entirely different person slunk off to join the common crowd it is in his quest for solid verification therefore that mundy now casually changes his vantage point first by flinging out a rhetorical arm then by spinning round on his box to point out to his audience the view the splendid the magnificent view afforded from the royal bedstead just follow my arm ladies and gents of the italian waterfall descending the northern slopes of the hennenkopf imagine youre lying there he urges his audience with a rush of exuberance to match the spectacular torrent with somebody who loves you well probably not in ludwigs case gusts of hysterical laughter from the russians but lying there anyway surrounded by all that royal bavarian gold and blue and you wake up one sunny morning and you open your eyes and you look out of the window at bang and on the word bang nails him sasha good god man where the hell have you been except that mundy says none of this neither does he indicate it by so much as a slip of the eye because sasha in the wagnerian spirit of the place is wearing his invisibility hat his tarnkappe as they used to call it the black basque beret worn severely across the brow that warns against the slightest indiscretion particularly in time of war in addition to which lest mundy has by any chance forgotten his clandestine manners sasha has placed a curled and pensive forefinger to his lips not in warning but rather in the dreamy pose of a man relishing the vicarious experience of waking up one sunny morning and looking out of the window at the waterfall coming down the hennenkopf the gesture is superfluous not the keenest watcher not the smartest surveillance camera in the world would have caught a hint of their reunion but sasha all the same sasha the midgetsentry vital even when he is motionless poised that little bit apart from the person nearest him in order to escape the comparison of height elbows lifted from his sides as if hes about to take off his fiery brown eyes aimed just above your eyeline never mind that like mundy youre taller than he is by a head and a half bonding accusing searching challenging eyes to inflame you question and unsettle you sasha as i live and breathe the tour is ending house rules forbid guides to solicit but allow them to hover at the doorway nodding their departing audience into the sunlight and wishing them a safe and simply marvelous holiday the take has always varied but war has reduced it to a trickle sometimes mundy stands emptyhanded till the end his bowler roosting on a convenient bust lest it be mistaken for anything as vulgar as a begging bowl sometimes a devoted middleaged couple or a schoolteacher with unruly charges will dart shyly forward and press a banknote on him then dart back into the throng this evening its a genial building contractor from melbourne and his wife darlene who need to explain to mundy that their daughter tracey did this very same tour way back in the winter with the selfsame travel company would you believe it and had just loved every minute of it maybe mundy remembered her because she sure as hell remembered the big tall pom in the bowler hat blond girl freckles and a ponytail boyfriend a medical student from perth plays rugby for his university and it is while mundy is putting on a show of hunting for tracey in his memory the boyfriends name was keith the building contractor confides in case its any help that he feels a hard small hand encircle his wrist turn it palm upward insert a folded note and close his fingers over it in the same moment out of the corner of his eye he glimpses sashas beret disappearing into the crowd next time youre in melbourne right the australian building contractor yells tucking a card into the pocket behind mundys union jack its a date mundy agrees with a cheery laugh and deftly palms the note into a side pocket of his jacket it is wise to sit down before you start a journey preferably on your luggage the superstition is russian but the axiom originates with nick amory who is mundys longtime advisor in matters of selfpreservation if something big is in the air edward and youre part of it then for pitys sake curb your natural impetuosity and give yourself a break before you jump the linderhofs day is over staff and tourists are hurrying towards the parking lot like a benign host mundy hovers on the steps bestowing multilingual benedictions on his departing colleagues auf wiedersehen frau meierhof still havent found them then he is referring to iraqs elusive weapons of mass destruction fritz tsch252ss love to your dear lady marvelous speech she made the other night at the poltergeist our local culture and debating club where mundy occasionally goes to let off political steam and to his french and spanish colleagues a married male couple pablo marcel well commiserate together next week buenas noches bonsoir the both of you the last stragglers disappear into the twilight as he withdraws into the shadows of the western prospect of the palace immersing himself in the blackness of a stairwell he stumbled on the place by luck soon after he took up the job exploring the castles precincts one evening a moonlight concert is to be held in the grounds and mustafa allowing he has a mind to stick around and hear it he discovers a humble basement staircase that leads nowhere descending it he meets a rusted iron door and in the door a key he knocks and hearing nothing turns the key and steps inside to anyone but mundy the space he enters is no more than a grubby plant room a dumping ground for watering cans old hoses and ailing plants no window just a grille high in the stone wall air heavy with the stink of putrid hyacinth and the rumblings of a boiler next door but to mundy it is everything mad ludwig was looking for when he built the linderhof in the first place a sanctuary a place of escape from his other places of escape he steps back outside relocks the door puts the key in his pocket and for seven working days bides his time while he mounts a systematic reconnaissance of his target by 10 am when the castle gates open all healthy plants in the public rooms have been watered and unhealthy plants removed the plant contractors van a flowerpainted minibus leaves the grounds at 1030 am latest by which time ailing plants have been consigned to the plant room or to the van for hospitalization the disappearance of the key has raised no eyebrows the lock has not been changed it follows that from eleven every morning the plant room is his private property it is his tonight standing his full height beneath the frugal ceiling lamp mundy extracts a penlight from his pocket unfolds the note until it becomes a rectangle of plain white paper and sees what he expects to see sashas handwriting as it always was and ever shall be the same spiky germanic es and rs the same adamant downstrokes that declare the man the expression on mundys face as he reads its message is hard to parse resignation anxiety and pleasure all play a part a rueful excitement dominates thirtyfour bloody years he thinks were men of three decades we meet we fight a war we separate for a decade we meet again and for a decade were indispensable to each other while we fight another we part forever and a decade later you come back fishing in his jacket pockets he takes out a scuffed book of matches from zaras kebab caf233 he plucks a match strikes it and holds the note in the flame by one corner then another until its a twisted flake of ash he lets it fall to the flagstones and grinds it to black dust with his heel a necessary observance he looks at his watch and does the arithmetic one hour and twenty minutes to kill no point to ringing her yet shell just have started work her boss goes crazy when the staff take personal calls in peak hours mustafa will be at dinas house with kamal mustafa and kamal are bosom pals leading lights of the westends allturkish national cricket league president mr edward mundy dina is zaras cousin and good friend scrolling through a mildewed cellphone he locates her number and

her too dirty to pray but under the concerted pressure of her two men zaras heart melted and now mo can do no wrong he rings the apartment and hears his own voice on the answering machine zara loves mundys voice sometimes when shes missing him in the daytime she says she plays the tape for company i may be late darling he warns her in their common german over the machine theres a meeting of staff

quite as much as i loved you this morning he adds severely so dont go thinking otherwise he glances at his watch one hour and ten minutes to go he advances on a wormeaten gilded chair and puts it in front of a dilapidated biedermeier wardrobe balancing on the chair he gropes behind the wardrobes pediment and extracts an ancient khaki knapsack thick with dust he pats the dust off sits down on the chair sets the knapsack on his lap yanks the webbing straps free of their tarnished buckles lifts the flap and peers dubiously inside as if uncertain what to expect gingerly he unpacks the contents onto a bamboo table one ancient group photograph of an angloindian family with its many native servants posed on the steps of a grand colonial house one buff folder marked file in aggressive handinked capitals one bundle of illwritten letters of a similar period one twist of womans hair dark brown bound round a sprig of dried heather but these objects attract only a curt acknowledgment from him what he is looking for and has perhaps deliberately left till last is a plastic folder in which float as many as twenty unopened letters addressed to mr teddy mundy care of his bank in heidelberg in the same black ink and spiky hand as the note he has this minute burned no senders name is supplied but none is needed floppy blue airletters coarsegrained third world envelopes reinforced with sticky tape and blazoned with stamps as radiant as tropical birds from places as far apart as damascus jakarta and havana first he sorts them into chronological order according to their postmarks then he slits them open one by one with an old tin penknife also from the knapsack he starts reading for what when you are reading something mr mundy first ask yourself why you are reading it he is hearing the accented voice of his old german teacher dr mandelbaum forty years ago are you reading something for information that is one reason or are you reading it for knowledge information is only the path mr mundy the goal is knowledge ill settle for knowledge hes thinking and i promise i wont fall for dangerous ideology he adds with a mental doff of the cap to the imam ill settle for knowing what i didnt want to know and im still not sure i want to how did you find me sasha why must i not recognize you who are you avoiding this time and why folded among the letters are press clippings torn impatiently from newspapers and bearing sashas byline the salient passages are highlighted or indicated by exclamation marks he reads for an hour returns the letters and press clippings to the knapsack and the knapsack to its hiding place the mixture as expected he silently tells himself no quarter given one mans war continues as planned age is not an excuse it never was and never will be he puts the gilded chair where he found it sits down again and remembers hes wearing his bowler hat he takes it off turns it upside down and peers into it a thing he does in pensive moments the maker steinmatzkys first name is joseph he owns to sons no daughters his firms address in vienna is no 19 d252rerstrasse above the bakers or it was because old man joseph steinmatzky liked to date his handiwork and this example boasts a vintage year 1938 staring into the hat he watches the scene unfold the cobbled alley the little shop above the bakers the smashed glass the blood between the cobblestones as joseph steinmatzky his wife and many sons are dragged away to the vociferous approval of viennas proverbially innocent bystanders he rises squares his shoulders lowers them and wriggles his hands around to loosen himself up he steps into the stairwell relocks the door mounts the stone steps strips of dew hover over the palace lawns the fresh air smells of mown grass and damp cricket field sasha you mad bastard what do you want now urging his volkswagen beetle over the hump between mad ludwigs golden gates mundy turns onto the road to murnau like its owner the car is no longer in its first youth its engine wheezes tired wipers have etched halfmoons on its windshield a homemade sticker on the back written by mundy in german reads the driver of this car has no further territorial claims in arabia he crosses two small intersections without mishap and as promised encounters a blue audi with a munich registration pulling out of the layby ahead of him with a silhouetted sasha in his beret crouched at the wheel for fifteen kilometers by the unreliable gauge of the volkswagen mundy clings to the audis tail the road sinks enters forest and divides without signaling sasha takes a left fork and mundy in his volkswagen scrambles after him avenues of black trees lead downward to a lake which lake according to sasha the only thing mundy has in common with leon trotsky is what the great man called topographical cretinism at a parking sign the audi descends a ramp and skids to a halt mundy does the same glancing in his mirror to see what if anything comes after him or what went by slowly without stopping nothing sasha with a shopping bag in his hand is scurrying unevenly down a flight of paved steps sasha believes that before he was born he lacked oxygen in the womb a jinglejangle of fairground music is coming up the path fairy lights are twinkling through the trees a village festival is in progress and sasha is heading towards it scared of losing him mundy closes the gap with sasha fifteen yards in front they plunge into an inferno of roistering humanity a merrygoround belches honkytonk a matador on a hay cart undulates before a cardboard bull while crooning in broad silesian about amor beersodden revelers oblivious to the war blow feathered snakes at each other nobody is out of place here not sasha not me everyones a citizen for a day and sasha hasnt forgotten his skills either over a loudspeaker the grossadmiral of a flagbedecked steamer is ordering stragglers to forget their troubles and report immediately for the romantic cruise a rocket bursts above the lake colored stars cascade onto the water incoming or outgoing ask bush and blair our two great war leaders neither of whom has seen a shot fired in anger sasha has vanished mundy looks up and to his relief sees him hauling himself and his shopping bag heavenward by way of a spiral iron staircase attached to an edwardian villa painted in horizontal stripes his strides are frantic they always were its the way he ducks his head each time he lunges with the right leg is the bag heavy no but sasha is careful to nurse it as he negotiates the curves a bomb perhaps not sasha never after another casual look round for whoever else may be coming to the party mundy climbs after him minimum let one week a painted sign warns him a week who needs a week these games finished fourteen years ago he glances down nobody is coming up after him the front door of each apartment as he works his way up is painted mauve and lit by fluorescent strip at a halflanding a hollowfaced woman in a sherpa coat and gloves is fumbling in her handbag he gives her a breathless gr252ss gott she ignores him or shes deaf take your gloves off woman and maybe youll find it still climbing he glances wistfully back at her as if she were dry land shes lost her door key shes locked her grandchild in her flat go back downstairs help her do your sir galahad act then go home to zara and mustafa and mo he keeps climbing the staircase turns another corner on mountaintops around him eternal snowpastures bask under a halfmoon below him the lake the fair the din and still no followers that hes aware of and before him a last mauve door ajar he pushes it it opens a foot but he sees only pitch darkness he starts to call out sasha but the memory of the beret restrains him he listens and hears nothing except the noise of the fair he steps inside and pulls the door shut behind him in the halfdarkness he sees sasha standing crookedly to attention with the shopping bag at his feet his arms are as straight to his sides as he can get them and his thumbs pressed forward in the best tradition of a communist party functionary on parade but the schiller face the fiery eyes the eager forwardleaning stance even in the flickering dusk have never appeared so vivid or alert you talk a lot of bullshit these days i would say teddy he remarks the same smothered saxon accent mundy records the same pedantic razoredged voice three sizes too big for him the same instant power of reproach your philological excursions are bullshit your portrait of mad ludwig is bullshit ludwig was a fascist bastard so was bismarck and so are you or you would have answered my letters but by then they are hastening towards each other for the longdelayed embrace
