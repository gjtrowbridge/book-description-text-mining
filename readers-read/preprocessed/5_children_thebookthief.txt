 i am in all truthfulness attempting to be cheerful about this whole topic though most people find themselves hindered in believing me no matter my protestations please trust me i most definitely can be cheerful i can be amiable agreeable affable and thats only the as just dont ask me to be nice nice has nothing to do with me reaction to the aforementioned fact does this worry you i urge youdont be afraid im nothing if not fair of course an introduction a beginning where are my manners i could introduce myself properly but its not really necessary you will know me well enough and soon enough depending on a diverse range of variables it suffices to say that at some point in time i will be standing over you as genially as possible your soul will be in my arms a color will be perched on my shoulder i will carry you gently away at that moment you will be lying there i rarely find people standing up you will be caked in your own body there might be a discovery a scream will dribble down the air the only sound ill hear after that will be my own breathing and the sound of the smell of my footsteps the question is what color will everything be at that moment when i come for you what will the sky be saying personally i like a chocolatecolored sky dark dark chocolate people say it suits me i do however try to enjoy every color i seethe whole spectrum a billion or so flavors none of them quite the same and a sky to slowly suck on it takes the edge off the stress it helps me relax a small theory people observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends but to me its quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations with each passing moment a single hour can consist of thousands of different colors waxy yellows cloudspat blues murky darknesses in my line of work i make it a point to notice them as ive been alluding to my one saving grace is distraction it keeps me sane it helps me cope considering the length of time ive been performing this job the trouble is who could ever replace me who could step in while i take a break in your stockstandard resortstyle vacation destination whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety the answer of course is nobody which has prompted me to make a conscious deliberate decisionto make distraction my vacation needless to say i vacation in increments in colors still its possible that you might be asking why does he even need a vacation what does he need distraction from which brings me to my next point its the leftover humans the survivors theyre the ones i cant stand to look at although on many occasions i still fail i deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them but now and then i witness the ones who are left behind crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization despair and surprise they have punctured hearts they have beaten lungs which in turn brings me to the subject i am telling you about tonight or today or whatever the hour and color its the story of one of those perpetual survivorsan expert at being left behind its just a small story really about among other things a girl some words an accordionist some fanatical germans a jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery i saw the book thief three times beside the railway line first up is something white of the blinding kind some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense well im here to tell you that it is white is without question a color and personally i dont think you want to argue with me a reassuring announcement please be calm despite that previous threat i am all bluster i am not violent i am not malicious i am a result yes it was white it felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow like it had pulled it on the way you pull on a sweater next to the train line footprints were sunken to their shins trees wore blankets of ice as you might expect someone had died they couldnt just leave him on the ground for now it wasnt such a problem but very soon the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on there were two guards there was one mother and her daughter one corpse the mother the girl and the corpse remained stubborn and silent well what else do you want me to do the guards were tall and short the tall one always spoke first though he was not in charge he looked at the smaller rounder one the one with the juicy red face well was the response we cant just leave them like this can we the tall one was losing patience why not and the smaller one damn near exploded he looked up at the tall ones chin and cried spinnst du are you stupid the abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment his skin widened come on he said traipsing over the snow well carry all three of them back on if we have to well notify the next stop as for me i had already made the most elementary of mistakes i cant explain to you the severity of my selfdisappointment originally id done everything right i studied the blinding whitesnow sky who stood at the window of the moving train i practically inhaled it but still i wavered i buckledi became interested in the girl curiosity got the better of me and i resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed and i watched twentythree minutes later when the train was stopped i climbed out with them a small soul was in my arms i stood a little to the right the dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother the girl and the small male corpse i clearly remember that my breath was loud that day im surprised the guards didnt notice me as they walked by the world was sagging now under the weight of all that snow perhaps ten meters to my left the pale emptystomached girl was standing froststricken her mouth jittered her cold arms were folded tears were frozen to the book thiefs face
