 twelve years ago late one night i found myself on a c135 transport plane that was taking me and two senatorial colleagues on the long flight across europe and the middle east to kuwait the persian gulf war had only recently ended and we were headed for a postwar inspection tour of the region john glenn john mccain and i had been discussing our shared love of flying until john glenn fell asleep and now john mccain and i sat in uncomfortable silence for a few moments until inevitably we started talking not about the gulf war but about our warmdashvietnam though we had served together in the us senate for nearly five years at that point we had never yet shared our common and separate experiences in vietnam we were aware of each otherrsquos public stories of course i knew that johnmdashthe son of a distinguished admiralmdashhad been a navy pilot who was shot down over north vietnam where he was held beaten and tortured for five and a half years much of that time served after he refused to accept freedom on terms that violated the pow code of honor governing the order of prisoner releases and john knew i had also been a navy officer commanding a ldquoswift boatrdquomdash a small fast patrol boat used for counterinsurgency missionsmdashin the mekong delta for two tours of duty unlike him i had been able to come back after i received my third purple heart upon my return however based on my strong feelings that our fighting men were being sacrificed for a mission in which our leaders no longer believed i got involved in the effort of veterans to stop the war not surprisingly john who was still imprisoned in the hanoi hilton at that time took a dim view of my antiwar activities and in fact campaigned for my republican opponent when i first ran for the us senate in 1984 but he didnrsquot really know the story of my personal experiences in vietnam just as i didnrsquot really know his the gulf between us on that issue was typical in those difficult years of the vietnam war there were too many on both the left and right in this country along with the communists in vietnam who had tried to pit those who had worn the uniform and now opposed the war against those who still supported it and who whether on the battlefields or in prison cells in hanoi continued to serve with the greatest of valor john mccain and i were caught up in that crossfire started by those who wanted differences over the war to become fundamental differences between two soldiers i donrsquot know exactly how long we talked about vietnam in that dark c135 cabin but by daybreak we shared a new understandingmdashand a new friendship and we built upon that friendship over the next few years to bring our war finally to an end later that year i was asked by the senate majority leader to chair a special committee on powmia affairs in part because of continuing media reportsmdash and family hopes that they raisedmdashthat a significant number of americans were still being secretly held in vietnam this issue moreover had led to the continuation of our economic boycott against vietnam and our refusal to resume normal diplomatic relations with that country even though the hostilities had ended nearly two decades earlier john mccain also agreed to serve on this committee both of us had signed up for what was generally regarded as one of the most thankless tasks in washington we had to review a thousand old documents struggle to achieve some level of cooperation from a vietnamese government that had hundreds of thousands of its own mias and deal with a powmia advocacy network that fed every wild rumor or conspiracy theory preying on the grief of families of americans who had not come home we had to fight against the rambo psychology of reopening all the contentious issues of the war all over again andmdashfor john mccain and me at any ratemdashwe had to come to grips with our own memories i certainly remembered how close i had come to being killed by rifle fire and rocket launchers from the shore in our forays deep into viet cong territory i remembered crew members and close friends who didnrsquot come back i knew i could have wound up like john mccain and the sons and husbands of those who anxiously followed our hearings a pow or mia we made a total of eight trips to vietnam during and immediately after our hearings these visits were filled with unforgettable experiences and one of the most deeply moving of them was accompanying john to the site of the hanoi hilton and seeing the tiny roommdashreally almost a cagemdashwhere he sacrificed a good part of his young adulthood for his country in pain and fear and isolation i have had no greater privilege in all my life than finding then standing on common ground with john mccain with whom i formed a close personal and political alliance during these hearings we insisted on examining all the evidence demanded that witnesses be held accountable for the reliability of their testimony and in the end convinced the entire committee to agree on a report that concluded that there were likely no americans still alive in vietnam and our alliance continued to the next steps our country needed to take to honorably put the war behind usmdashabandonment of the economic boycott against vietnam and normalization of diplomatic relations president clinton had the courage to put these policies into action and he still says that he couldnrsquot have done it without the constant presence and united support of two vietnam vets named johnmdashone a democrat one a republican one a famous pow the other a famous war protester as for me irsquom most proud of the fact that when we say the word ldquovietnamrdquo today we mean not just a war but a countrymdashat long last a place where as i hoped thirty years ago ldquoamerica turned and veterans helped in the turningrdquo my friendship with john mccain has continued and even strengthened after our last vietnam mission and neither of us has much use for those in either party who complain that we should keep to our own partisan interests in fact we have discovered that we share something far more precious than party a common call to service i learned several important lessons during our effort to put the war behind us for ourselves our generation and our country i learned how to reach across partisan and ideological divides to find common ground in the rich soil of american values and experiences i learned how to overcome the passionate convictions of narrow interest groups to build a consensus based on facts rather than prejudice i learned how to make my personal experiences a platform for broader lessons about american ideals and their special place in the worldrsquos struggle for peace and justice and perhaps most important i learned that the call to service did not end with a discharge from the navy or election to the united states senate irsquom pretty sure that our mutual experience in transcending the vietnam trauma was one important factor that led john mccain to run for president in 2000 as a serious reformer a ldquostraight talkerrdquo and a patriot who believes our willingness to meet domestic challenges is as important a test of national will as our willingness to engage in warfare he did his best to summon his party to rise to such values and had he succeeded the country would be in much better hands today i donrsquot believe therersquos much left in the republican party of the spirit of true civic service or the courage to defy powerful interests and seriously address the most pressing national issues and too many people in my own democratic party are focused on narrow interests and as a result have too little vision of the vast potential for achievement at home and abroad for the united states under the kind of leadership we deserve itrsquos time for a new call to service itrsquos time to rally democrats republicans and inde pendents alike to face the common challenges of this generation in the course of my career from the mekong delta to the senate irsquove tried to muster the right combination of the toughness to govern and the compassion to caremdashalong with a deep commitment to justice and to americarsquos progressive values but my experiences have taught me that a leader succeeds only to the extent that he is able to communicate his values his goals his ideas and much of who he is in direct communication one on one i began that kind of conversation with john mccain on a c135 late one night and itrsquos continued ever since i want to begin that conversation with my fellow citizens in this book and during this presidential campaign and continue it while we work together to meet the challenges of our age why i am running for president i am a child of the greatest generation of americans and therefore a member of the most fortunate generation of americans like my parents i have always hoped and often assumed that my own children will have more opportunities in life than i had and will live in a country and in a world where such opportunities are more widely shared and more deeply rooted than at any time in the past i am running for president in no small part to redeem that promise for the america to come while we are living today in the most extraordinary and powerful nation on earth i believe not only that americarsquos best days are still to come but that our best work is yet to be done we have the capacity to lift the life of our own land as well as lead the world to a safer and more hopeful future but doing so will require equal measures of strength vision and resolve embodied in a leadership that grasps both the breadth of our potential and the great legacy of our past as americans we inherit with our birthright of freedom a sacred chain of responsibility that stretches back to the founders and to the sacrifices of the immigrants who built this country before and after them and extends to the present day our task is not just to guarantee material progress along with a better life we must pass on to our children that unique sense of optimism and that godgiven belief in the universal appeal of our ideals that have always marked our national character i look ahead with confidence because all around us i see evidence that the children of the babyboom generation have the right stuff the skill and courage of the young men and women who went into harmrsquos way in afghanistan and iraqmdashand for that matter at ground zero in new yorkmdashmatch the best of my generation during the cold war and my parentsrsquo generation during the second world war in that conflict my father flew dc3s in the army air corps afterward he entered the diplomatic service and was privileged to be an active participant during the historic period when this nation forged a ldquogrand and global alliancerdquo against tyranny with measures that ranged from the marshall plan through nato to a host of multilateral institutions his was the greatest generation not just because it defeated fascism but because it was determined after the war to create a nation worthy of all the effort and sacrifice that had been made and a world worthy of the cause for which they had fought my parents raised me with a belief in patriotism and service after i joined the navy during the vietnam war i commanded a naval gunboat patrolling the mekong delta then when i came home after two tours of duty i decided that the same sense of service demanded something more of me this led me to protest the very war in which i had fought while always honoring those who fought before me with me and after me it may be hard to understand three decades later but for all the conflict and contention over vietnam here at home this period was also a time when the people of our country were drawn into a great civic discourse critical national issues had come to the center of peoplersquos everyday lives we had both the burden and the honor of facing in a short span of time a long list of topics that would fundamentally change our livesmdashcivil rights womenrsquos rights the environment economic opportunity and reclaiming democracy itself from elected leaders who lied to us and broke the laws they were sworn to uphold we americans took our country back and moved our country forward that was the real america for which i had fought in the vietnam war and in the antiwar movement and i am still convincedmdashand can cite witnesses across the former soviet empire who will confirm my beliefmdashthat it was the power of our values as much as the power of weapons that finally won the cold war in world war and in cold war our people never lost the determination to make sure that our country was truly the best it could be they knew there were things worth fighting for both at home and abroad it is that determination i hope to bring to the election of 2004 to the presidency of the united states and to the common challenges americans face therersquos a famous old saying that all leaders tend to be either hedgehogs or foxes a hedgehog knows one thing very well and a fox knows a little about everything i suspect i would qualify as a hedgehog whorsquos been around the field a few times in the course of my public career irsquove had the chance to master a range of issuesmdashveterans issues after the war crime as a prosecutor economic development as a lieutenant governor and then foreign policy health care intelligence national defense drug trafficking technology and education during nineteen years as a us senator i donrsquot consider myself a policy wonk but i was brought up to care about the big issues and to think for myself not hire others to do the thinking for me while my father richard kerry was serving as a diplomat my mother rosemary became a serious civic activist and an environmentalist before the word ldquoecologyrdquo was widely used and i first got to know my wife teresa at a policy conference in south america itrsquos no surprise that irsquom accustomed to talking about ideas and world events around the dinner table and that my family is a central part of my political life wersquove kept up the tradition with my daughters alex and vanessa and my stepsons john andre and chris theyrsquove all been nurtured on a steady diet of civic obligation irsquove also benefited from a pretty remarkable extended family of people who have influenced my thinking and helped keep me humble and hungry for knowledge first and foremost have been my brothersinarms from vietnam my crewmates from pcf 94 and pcf 44 we came from different states and backgrounds but all that really mattered was that we were all from america my real growing up came with them on a fragile boat under enemy fire halfway across the world thirtyfive years later they still help me keep my bearings we share a precious unshakable bond that veterans understand and others respect while i was an antiwar activist and veterans advocate after vietnam my extended family grew to include thousands who had always passionately loved their country and often passionately disagreed with one another about how to fight for their countryrsquos values after i testified before the senate foreign relations committee on behalf of the vietnam veterans against the war i felt as if i had heard from every one of them whether happy angry approving or damning along with their parents their wives and girlfriends and their children and i quickly learned to listen to the veterans of world war ii and korea who shared our sacrifices but didnrsquot like our long hair our music or our challenges to authority all these experiences helped me deal with the ultimate extended family of constituents i have represented in elected office i will never forget meeting crime victims as an assistant district attorney in middlesex county massachusetts crime too often is reduced to a statistic but from each of them i learned that every act of violence gives rise to an individual human tragedy since then as lieutenant governor and as a senator irsquove talked with countless citizens often in happy moments but often too at some of the hardest times in their livesmdashmen and women displaced from their homes by natural disasters or from their jobs by technological change families overwhelmed by healthcare costs or frustrated by bad schools citizens struggling to obtain medical benefits for their parents or get questions answered by bureaucrats i canrsquot say irsquove heard it all but i have heard a lot and irsquove tried to learn something from every encounter with a person a problem or an idea that crosses my path i donrsquot think itrsquos an exaggeration at all to say that the 2004 election represents a real crossroads for our country during the 1990s we were actually beginning to make real progress on a range of national problems that people had pretty much come to regard as immutable parts of the landscape violent crime fell sharply after nearly twentyfive years of steady increases welfare dependency was down by more than half teen pregnancy and abortion rates decreased we adopted tough measures to reduce acid rain and raise water quality inner cities were being reborn all across the country real incomes rose for the middle class for the first time in two decades healthcare costs stabilized technological innovations exploded and productivity increased dramatically millions of working familiesmdashfor the first time ever a majority in this nation or any nationmdashjoined the investor class and america created the first mass uppermiddle class in human history nearly thirty years of federal budget deficits were replaced by budget surpluses so large as to defy the imagination from a statistical point of view nearly everything good went up and nearly everything bad went down and all this progress occurred despite partisan warfare and gridlock in congress and an administration under bill clinton that became more and more distracted and embattled by endless allegations and the investigations that grew out of them while we canrsquot go back to the exact policies of the clinton yearsmdashas a progressive i believe we should always be looking forward and embracing changemdashit is hard to believe that most people wouldnrsquot want to go back to the kind of results they helped achieve instead in the name of ideology and on behalf of selfish interests the bush administration has been systematically dismantling just about everything government accomplished during the 1990s environmen tal protection international diplomacy substantial investments in basic scientific and technological research fiscal discipline and the commitment to a fairer society of opportunity for all not surprisingly its policies have begun to have seriously alarming consequences a sluggish economy rising crime the largest budget deficits in history and the weakening of our alliances and standing around the world another four years of the bush agenda especially if there is a republican congress will take this country so far off track that it could take a generation to put things right again but if we put the country back on a progressive course in 2004 i believe we can rebuild the prosperity of the 1990s reverse a long series of bad decisions and evasions of responsibility restore americarsquos world leadership in the eyes of our friends and our enemies alike and protect the liberties that make this country a beacon to the hopeful and a reproach to tyrants everywhere we have the chance to truly protect americans from terrorism at home and abroad while calling on all americans to join in the fulfillment of our freedom and democracy the time has come to renew our best hopes take up the great unfinished business of our society and take on the big challenges that many people have come to consider as hopeless challenges like achieving energy independence providing universal access to health care creating highquality schools for all students using technology to drastically reform how government works and turning the rhetoric of workercontrolled lifelong learning into a reality and if i have anything to say about it we will also make a commitment to political and civic reform turning the tide of cynicism and indifference about politics and government and making our democracy both far more participatory and truly representative my fellow democrats donrsquot agree on all of these issues or how exactly to resolve them and thatrsquos as it should be i want my party to be an open door for lively debate not a mirror image of the narrow ideological sect that the republicans are becoming most of us however do agree that george w bush is leading america in a very dangerous direction while we all admired the way he rallied the nation after 911 we also believe that he is by ideology inclination and experience incapable of keeping america strong enough at home or abroad to sustain us in peace or in war over the long haul the question we now face is how to make that case to the widest span of the american peoplemdashdemocrats independents and moderate republicans alikemdashand offer a clear alternative agenda i like so many of my fellow democrats am still angry about the painful and protracted events that followed the 2000 election and that perhaps altered its outcome we should channel this anger into positive grassroots energy and into a determination never to let voters be disenfranchised again president bush has enough bad policies on which to focus our energies there is no need to ascribe to him a weak intellect or bad intentions as a political strategy we should not deny him his few successes or refuse to acknowledge the affection his plainspokenness and quiet selfconfidence inspire in many for my part i intend to run a presidential campaign organized around a contest of ideas values and policies rather than a clash of personalities or a war between political tribes to those who think that sounds naiumlve i would point to my last contested senatorial reelection campaign in 1996 when i was challenged by william weld a very popular incumbent governor therersquos no question that that campaign could have degenerated into a mud bath if we had let it it was a close race between two longtime statewide elected officials with nearly universal name recognition the kind of race that is often decided by turnout we both had advisers who urged us to focus on ldquoenergizingrdquo our supporters with emotional appeals and attack ads and forget about persuading the relatively small group of undecided voters but governor weld and i chose another path for our campaignsmdasha long series of debates rigorously focused on issues rather than personalities a process that let voters reach their own judgments about our differences our characters and our capacity for leadership by the end of that campaign we all sincerely felt we were part of something unique and valuable which had not only raised the level of civic discourse in massachusetts but had actually boosted voter turnout through positive rather than negative means thatrsquos precisely the kind of contest i would like to have with george w bush and itrsquos one that i believe will serve the nation well president bill clinton once said that running for the presidency against an incumbent is like an extended job interview with the american people you have to convince voters to fire the chief executive then hire you as the replacement i would add to that sentiment that you donrsquot have any business running for the presidency if you donrsquot know and canrsquot explain exactly how you would do a better job my case for sending george w bush back to his ranch in crawford texas is based on three big promises he made when he was in my position in the year 2000 then subsequently abandoned first he pledged over and over again to ldquochange the tonerdquo in washingtonmdashto reach out to democrats and all americans and overcome the partisan bitterness of the late 1990s that promise became much more important when he took office after having lost the popular vote becoming president only by virtue of an eternally controversial ruling by the narrowest possible majority of the us supreme court but since then the president has done the very opposite of what he promised presiding over the most partisan administration i have experienced in my nearly twenty years in the senate he reaches out to democrats only occasionally primarily to invite surrender to his political and legislative demands the tone in washington despite the longing for unity inspired by 9 11 is so poisonously partisan that a growing majority of americansmdashwho have become either nonvoters or independentsmdashare no longer allied with either side the president and his closest colleagues have personally contributed to this toxic atmosphere by denouncing any thoughtful differences of opinion as unpatriotic cynically invoking loyalty in the service of party obedience second george w bush pledged frequently to temper the harsh ideology of his party with a ldquocompassionate conservatismrdquo that would harness our nationrsquos civic energy in the pursuit of justice and opportunity for the poor and forgotten there is no question that the president has broken this promise as well his one exercise in compassion was the no child left behind act of 2001 an education reform effort that i supported the stated purpose of that legislation was to offer a new bargain to states and school districts under which they would accept greater accountability for results in exchange for the resources and the flexibility to get the job done the bush administration began welshing on its side of the bargain almost before the ink was dry on the bill undermining education funding as part of a larger strategy of directing every available dollar toward tax cuts for the wealthiest americans this has been sadly typical of the administrationrsquos approach to government a rhetoric of compassion and concern accompanied by policies that are compassionate primarily toward the most comfortable members of our society and that leads me to the third big promise the president has broken he pledged many times to usher in a ldquoresponsibility erardquo to exercise brave leadership whatever the political costs and in the words he used in the 2003 state of the union address not to ldquopass along our problems to other congresses other presidents and other generationsrdquo by reneging on this promise the president has betrayed his claim to represent the mature and responsible face of the babyboom generation among the many dangers the administration is refusing to deal with are global climate change the impending crisis in retirement programs the culture of corporate corruption the need for a genuine homeland security system our vulnerability to energy blackmail the ldquoloose nukesrdquo problem in the former soviet union and the threat of worldwide economic deflation this is the first administration since calvin coolidgersquos that believes that the national government canrsquot do anything about the economy other than giving more to those who already have the most and this is the same administration that has managed to pass along trillions of dollars in new debt along with neglect of big national challenges to future generations in my campaign i intend to hold the president accountable for breaking all three of his big promises applying the very standards he set for himself and therersquos an even more fundamental issue upon which i intend to pose the choice between another term for george w bush and a kerry administration it is a question central to all the challenges our country faces in the new world created by the end of the cold war with communism and the beginning of a war with terrorist networks and other globalized threats to our security i believe what america needs is a president determined to restore our sense of common national purpose no matter what issue foreign or domestic i addressmdashno matter where in the country irsquom speaking no matter the audiencemdashmy underlying message will be the same itrsquos time to renew a sense of common purpose it is a quality our nation has been losing for several decadesmdashindeed for much of my lifetimemdashand it is a quality i firmly believe we must restore my presidential campaign will be built around the ideas of shared endeavor national service intergenerational obligation and activism aimed at overcoming partisan and personal rivalries to meet the demands of a decisive even fateful era thatrsquos why irsquove titled this book a call to service i hear that call and i believe most americans are ready to hear it as well and to respond to it but itrsquos not a call they will hear from george w bush who in the days after 911 so memorably asked americans to shop and travel as their contribution to the fight against terrorism from that moment on therersquos been a striking contrast between the presidentrsquos willingness to use stirring patriotic rhetoric and his unwillingness to apply the true spirit of patriotism to any aspect of national policy beyond actual military operations as only one example he broke a promise in the 2002 state of the union address to provide more opportunities for national service by passively accepting congressional republican efforts to gut the americorps program that offers precisely such opportunities there are literally hundreds of issues on which i strongly disagree with the bush administration and a republicanism thatrsquos drifted far from its roots as the party of lincoln and is obsessed with dividing the union that lincoln saved the one policy that bothers me most is their deliberate and consistent effort to undermine the ideal of shared sacrifice and purpose devotion to the common good and responsibility to future generations instead this administration has made its top wartime priority the easing of the tax burden on its wealthiest citizensmdashthe citizens least likely to face sacrifices at home or abroad in a time of war this president has all but endorsed the most invidious conservative policy of our time that cutting taxes for the people who least need help turning budget surpluses into deficits and piling debts on our children are all useful strategies because they will effectively paralyze our own governmentmdashthe instrument of our democracymdashby denying it the revenues to pay for progress using tax dollars paid by all americans to comfort the comfortable while starving the commonwealth has become an item of orthodoxy for a republican party that has left behind not only millions of children not only its promises but its own honorable traditions of moderation and national stewardship whether itrsquos an energy policy that perpetuates dependence on middle eastern oil an environmental policy that denies global climate change a health care policy that proposes to dismantle medicare and medicaid a civil rights policy that pretends to be colorblind while denying educational opportunity to all americans or a judicial philosophy that would appoint activist judges determined to validate discrimination or repudiate a womanrsquos right to choose this is not an administration focused on our longterm interests as a nation this is an administration that is exploiting our national security challenges as a rationale for dismantling the achievements of a progressive era that lasted from theodore roosevelt to bill clinton and taking america back to a system of goitalone economics and politics this dismantling of the commonwealth is fundamentally corrosive of our national strength not just at home but ultimately abroad as well i believe americans sense that we can and must do better and my aim is to mobilize a new national resolve to rebuild our commonwealth and with it our strength i believe americarsquos destiny is to become a living testament to what free human beings can accomplish by acting in unity the administration currently in the white house apparently believes we canrsquot accomplish anything together other than waging war thatrsquos the contrast i will constantly draw during this campaign and itrsquos one that will give americans a clear even stark choice in november of 2004 every successful political message conveys three things values and goals then ideas or proposals to reach those goals to put it another way all candidates must explain who they are what they want to do and how they want to do it we democrats have traditionally been very good at that last stepmdashtalking about our programs we sometimes forget however to explain just what our programs are supposed to accomplish and far too many of us are likewise uncomfortable talking about our own values but a presidential contest is an arena in which you inevitably reveal who you are and what yoursquore made of just in the course of dealing with the pressures of the campaign itself some candidates fall apart or selfdestruct over the very subject of how they define themselves as people itrsquos crucial to be true to yourself and true to your record of thoughts words and deeds recognizing at the same time that the world changes and that how you apply your values must evolve like life itself some political insiders have called me aloof over the years i have a feeling that my spending not one weekend in washington for more than seventeen years may have something to do with that label irsquom not aloof at all with the colleagues friends and constituents i have spent time with when irsquom away from washington likewise irsquove been misunderstood for having come from a comfortable background that is certainly true but it was a background built on a foundation of duty and service which my family considered a responsibility and i am deeply grateful to have served america to have done my part no matter how small to help our great nation fortunately i recognize that life is more than politics or power as someone might guess from my early decision to serve on fast boats in the navy i love pastimes that bring together the sky wind and surf one of my favorite sports in fact is windsurfing followed by sailing as a close second irsquom a trained glider pilot but generally fly with an engine in the winter i love to ski and skate and i am so addicted to ice hockey that i still fantasize about starting a professional overfifty senior league i have been an avid biker bicycle and motorcycle all my life i bought a harleydavidson last year and have been trying to talk teresa into riding with me ever since i rarely get time to ride now which irsquom confident pleases her greatly if there was an espn 112 i would be a charter subscriber but all this is just background music to the main theme of my life right now i donrsquot want the democrats to nominate me because irsquom a charter member of one of the most selective but fastest growing sports clubs in the world the nascar fans of massachusetts i donrsquot intend to challenge president bush to a contest of whorsquos a more regular guy i will however challenge him to a contest of ideas and vision and irsquom confident i will be able to compete from a position of strength beating an incumbent president is always a difficult task doing so in a period of external threat to the nation is even harder moreover this administration can call on almost unlimited campaign money and a fanatically loyal rightwing party base that looks forward to a second bush term as the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow theyrsquove been chasing for decades finally the bush administration is among the most bellicose in our history determined to have a second term in the white house to win this election in the face of such opposition wersquore going to have to be especially selfdisciplined focused and loyal to the broad interests of the nation we canrsquot afford a selfindulgent campaign that congratulates us for our superior virtue as democrats while alienating a majority of the voting public we canrsquot treat the bush ad ministrationrsquos errors and faults as selfevident we will have to explain them in specific detail every day to voters who are as skeptical of us as they are of the republicans we arenrsquot going to win merely by energizing ourselves and getting a big democratic turnout although we canrsquot win without doing that with about onethird of the electorate unattached to either party and with at least onethird of votingage citizens not even bothering to vote we must make this a campaign of persuasion as well as mobilization republicans will obviously have their own version of what distinguishes the two parties arguing that we are addicted to government programs alienated from mainstream values and unwilling to use the best military in the world to defend the american people in a time of war we must never accept these stereotypes i will say all across this country that patriotism and the flag donrsquot belong to any president or any party but to all americans and if i am the democratic nominee i will proudly proclaim the values that make us democrats our commitment to equal opportunity our belief that economic growth is built on the work and talent of all our people our commitment to international rules and institutions that promote peace security prosperity freedom and democracy our concern for a vibrant and participatory democracy here at home our willingness to meet national challenges before they become emergencies and above all our determination to make government not an end in itself but a vehicle for the achievement of common goals i argued in 2002 that democrats were making a big mistake by dealing with every defense and foreign policy issue by supporting the president and changing the subject opposing the president and changing the subject or simply changing the subject from the getgo they tried instead to address the insecurity of the american people by just offering them prescription drug coverage but the tactic didnrsquot work and irsquom not ashamed to say it shouldnrsquot have worked a national political party with nothing much to say about national security in a time of war is evading its responsibilities in contrast to the dangerous mix of isolationism and unilateralism that characterizes the republicans my kind of democrat should speak from a position of strength on international issues that position is the toughminded multilateral cooperative tradition of democratic internationalism forged by woodrow wilson and franklin d roosevelt in the course of two world wars and by harry truman and john f kennedy in the cold war it acknowledges that multilateral organizationsmdashall created at the initiative of the united statesmdashare vehicles for the promotion of our ideals and the protection of our interests around the world and it recognizes that those ideals and interests in this globalized world are consistent with the peace prosperity and selfdetermination of every country on earth democratic internationalists understand that there are times when america must challenge the un nato and our allies to stand up for their own preferred values and they also realize that there are times when america must be challenged to live up to its values as well that is why i view my own service in the navy in the vietnam war and my public dissent from the direction of that war before and after i served as two sides of the same coin america has taken a rare step in human history in arguing that its interests and the worldrsquos are one i fully accept the challenge of moral as well as military leadership that that claim demands beyond national security issues i will urge democrats and republicans alike to get out of the habit of thinking of issues as belonging exclusively to one party or another after democrats made that mistake in the 1970s and 1980s bill clinton was elected and reelected president in no small part because he refused to play this game of issue ownership instead of treating national defense crime welfare reform fiscal discipline or economic development as enemy territory to be avoided at all costs he came up with progressive positions on these issues which not only changed the perception that democrats didnrsquot care about them but also challenged republicans to come up with proposals on ldquodemocratic issuesrdquo like health care and education as president clinton understood the people who actually cast votes do not have brains divided into left and right ideological segments that vibrate only when stimulated by particular liberal or conservative messages americans expect their elected officials to have a constructive solution to every national problem more to the point democrats cannot truly hold president bush responsible for the vast phony potemkin village of his nicesounding but empty domestic policies unless we hold ourselves responsible for articulating our policies on ldquotheirrdquo defense and foreign policy issues if irsquom leading the democratic party in 2004 i will present a 360degree view of where america is today and i will articulate it in a language that speaks to everyone instead of just preaching to the choir another part of the democratic heritage that i want to reclaim is the ability to appeal to americans as americans though itrsquos one of our oldest traditions to stand for equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none we democrats have gotten out of the habit of appealing to voters as citizens of the united states and have instead sometimes addressed them primarily as members of interest or constituency groups or as consumers of government benefits and tax cuts to be sure millions of americans belong to groups of people who have been marginalized in todayrsquos politics or worse yet have not yet achieved full political rights one of the core values of the democratic party past present and future is to include the excluded and champion the disenfranchised our goal should be to offer every american the chance to transcend group differences and our goal for america should be to make those things we have in common more important than those things that divide us we must show that democrats take unity and diversitymdashissues that have been given only token attention by republicansmdash seriously the best place to start this process is by making it clear that democrats will not contract out our commitment to equal opportunity to any organization that claims to speak for groups of american citizens for my part i will not have a subdivided campaign message or campaign structure thatrsquos different for men or women african americans or hispanics gays and lesbians or heterosexuals catholics protestants and jews or the irreligiousmdashor any other way we can segment the electorate every single person in my campaign will be attentive not just to democrats whose rights have been disrespected in the past but to any citizens in the same position in my view civil rights are as important to the majority as to any minority and we must all stand or fall together on our commitment to full unconditional affirmative and assertive equal opportunity for every american itrsquos precisely our willingness to demand the aggressive pursuit of equal opportunity as a basic part of the american creed that distinguishes democrats from republicans wersquore not a coalition of groups demanding programs or power wersquore a coalition of american citizens asking for the same rights for and obligations of one another as fate would have it i learned a new personal lesson about diversity and the american mosaic late last year anticipating my candidacy the boston globe looked into my family history among other things the paper discovered that one hundred years ago my paternal grandfather was an austrian jew named fritz kohn who changed his name to kerry and converted to catholicism shortly before immigrating to massachusetts i didnrsquot know this because my grandfather died when my father was just five years oldmdasha reminder of how much so much of americarsquos history is buried one thing that hasnrsquot changed for me as a result of this revelation is my catholic heritage i am a believing and practicing catholic married to another believing and practicing catholic and being an american catholic at this particular moment in history has three particular implications for my own point of view as a candidate for the presidency the first two follow directly from the two great commandments set forth in the scriptures our obligations to love god with all our hearts souls and minds and to love our neighbors as ourselves the first commandment means we must believe that there are absolute standards of right and wrong they may not always be that clear but they exist and it is our duty to honor them as best we can the second commandment means that our commitment to equal rights and social justice here and around the world is not simply a matter of political fashion or economic and social theory but a direct command from god from this perspective ldquochristianrdquo bigotry and intolerance are nothing less than a direct affront to godrsquos law and a rejection of godrsquos love therersquos a third facet of being an american catholic that i take very seriously wersquove always been a minority in this country and have sometimes suffered persecution to a larger extent than catholics elsewhere we have supported and relied upon the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state to guarantee our right to worship and our liberty of conscience that tradition strongly advanced by john kennedy in his quest to become our first catholic president helped make religious affiliation a nonissue in american politics it should stay that way democrats and republicans must also take a long look at our recent tendency to compete in a politics of personal selfinterest itrsquos really become an anomaly just about every democratic activist or elected official irsquove ever known entered politics out of a belief in principle and in progress for all not just for some wersquore by tradition the party that actually upholds collective action through government as essential to build a true commonwealth as well as to defend individual liberties and create individual opportunity one of our central goals is to convince people to think beyond their own selfish interests and accept the responsibilities of citizenship and the mission of spreading freedom and democracy yet in recent election cycles democrats have tried to compete with republicans in a bidding war to see who can shower voters with the greater share of the public treasury our prescription drug benefits versus their tax cuts our teacher salaries versus their vouchers our stuff versus their stuff wersquove managed to join the republicans in an effort to convince the citizens of the proudest nation on earth to conduct a personal costbenefit analysis of their relationship with government and to view elections as a chance to cut a better deal i think this is a betrayal of democratic principle and it too is selfdefeating we can never beat todayrsquos republicans in appeals to selfishness at the core of republicansrsquo purpose and policies is a big step backward toward their latenineteenthcentury tradition of social darwinisim elitism and the celebration of economic privilege as part of the natural order of things even in their rare ldquocompassionaterdquo moments todayrsquos republicans often offer charity instead of genuine opportunity or justice they express sympathy for the less privileged with a spirit of pity for lifersquos losers instead of solidarity for fellow citizens who deserve the chance to gain a position in the winnerrsquos circle my campaign will refuse to play the ldquowhatrsquos in it for merdquo game instead we will put our message where our hearts are asking the american people to join us in a citizensrsquo campaign to make this country as strong prosperous wise and bighearted as we know it can be on every major political issue we should ask americans to frame key political questions not in terms of whatrsquos in it for them but whatrsquos in it for all of us we should ask americans to think of the federal budget not as a dispenser of benefits and a confiscator of wealth but as a balance sheet of investments that we as a people have decided are important enough to tax ourselves to make we should ask americans to think of our foreign policy not just as a projection of our influence and our military power but of our principles and our freedoms we should ask americans to think of the impending crisis in the social security and medicare system not as a problem affecting the pocketbooks of seniors but as an intergenerational challenge to our willingness to lay aside a portion of our wealth for future needs we know that we will soon have we should ask americans to think of energy policy not just in immediate terms of pump prices but in terms of our standing in the world and our capacity to sustain economic growth while preserving our environment at home and we should ask americans to think of our civil liberties not as rights to be defended only when it is convenient and ignored when it is not but as essential to who we are if we can begin to get our fellow citizens to look at the worldmdashat their worldmdashfrom a fundamentally patriotic perspective on domestic as well as international issues the difference between democrats and republicans will become unmistakably clear and so will the choices in 2004 therersquos one other element of our democratic heritage that i want to reclaim to make it clear just how much we differ from republicans our heritage as the party of reform republicans typically donrsquot care how effective domestic government programs are because as a matter of principle they donrsquot believe in domestic government but democrats must be scrupulously concerned about the results we get for the taxpayer dollars we invest we should be passionately involved not just to ensure that wellintentioned programs have the resources they need to succeed but that success is achieved in measurable ways across the entire domestic agenda democrats should welcome and champion new ideas not distrust change as a threat to the familiar status quo for example irsquove been a passionate advocate of reforming our public schools during my senate career and it bothers me that some democrats have resisted the idea of making educational outcomesmdashthe skills and knowledge our kids obtain from the educational systemmdashas important as educational inputsmdash the adequate funding the good facilities and the higher teacher pay we all want in every area of government we should be the first to demand demonstrable results because we are the first to claim that the public sector can get results but we should never confuse government as an organizer of public resources with government as an owneroperator of public enterprises some areas like public schools and the police are properly the province of the public sector we canrsquot strengthen education by weakening public education but there are countless areasmdashchild care afterschool programs environmental protectionmdash where government can and should work through community organizations nonprofit and even forprofit private enterprises or publicprivate partnerships most of all i believe we should respond to republican attacks on government not simply by defending it warts and all but by reforming government to achieve the best possible results through the most efficient means and the freshest ideas the great progressives of the pastmdashfdr jfk lbjmdashdid not envision the new deal the new frontier or the great society as perfect or permanent accomplishments if we are to be called progressives we must rekindle the innovative spirit that created the best government initiatives not worship the dead letter of their programmatic residue the reinventing government movement of the 1990s needs to be revivedmdash and indeed it is already being revived by governors mayors and county executives whose revenue windfalls of the clinton boom have been replaced by the hard fiscal times of the bush bust at every level of government we need to find ways to reduce bureaucracy focus on results distinguish high priorities from low ones and deploy technology to achieve more with less if we stop defending the bad things about government we will no longer risk losing the argument to republicans who want to throw out the good with the bad and pare back public investments across the board our reform agenda must include not only government programs but also our democratic system itself the time has come for us to be ashamed of living in the country with the lowest voting participation and the highest campaign spending of any advanced democratic society as the international controversy over our confrontation with iraq has shown people in other democracies which have much higher voting rates have logically wondered if the bush administrationrsquos hard line truly reflects the large majority of votingage americans who did not vote for george w bush unlike ideologues on the left or the right irsquom not confident that i know for a fact that nonvoters ultimately favor one party or another but i do know irsquod be more confident in making that judgment if voting rates rose to european levels and as i have repeatedly said my campaign will focus on mobilizing nonvoters in part because itrsquos the right thing to do and in part because i donrsquot want to be a president like our current one whose ldquomandaterdquo comes from a small minority of the american people and because so many americans refrain from political and civic involvement because they rightly disapprove of the way campaigns are financed by special interests i will do everything within my power to work toward a system that includes public financing full disclosure of contributions and more civil campaigns a campaign that rediscovers our democratic heritage of common national purposemdashthat insists on meeting all our countryrsquos challenges domestic and foreign that engages all citizens equally in that task and that makes government an instrument of the popular willmdashwill give democrats and the independents we seek to attract the best and highest ground for taking on the republican party and the bush administration i believe that as a candidate for the presidency i may confidently put my values my record in public life my knowledge of how the world works from international and military affairs to small business to family life and my agenda for what america can become up against anyone elsersquos i donrsquot really care about labels if irsquom dismissed by republicans or conserv ative media as a massachusetts liberal or attacked by democratic rivals or liberal media as a clintonstyle centrist i will simply state my values and my ideas and let the voters make their own decisions the progressive tradition that i claim is not exclusively the province of either political party or of the political left or right it was expressed more than 140 years ago by abraham lincoln who told his first wartime congress this ldquothe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our case is new so we must think anew and act anewrdquo that same tradition was championed by one of my predecessors as a senator from massachusetts whose younger brother is my senior colleague and a continuing influence on my conscience and my agenda in accepting the democratic nomination for the presidency in 1960 john kennedy did not tell people what government would do for them instead he called the nation to a higher standard ldquothe new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promisesmdashit is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them it appeals to their pride not their pocketbookmdashit holds out the promise of more sacrifice instead of more securityrdquo itrsquos that spirit that democrats need to lead the country and that america needs to lead the world we must stand for the courage to challenge and the vision to lead the bush administration for all its claims about the necessity of fighting terrorists overseas has a timid unimaginative and fundamentally reactionary agenda for america that will make us selfish and secondrate at a time when we should be united and great we have the means and the opportunity in this country to create the highest standard of living the world has ever seen we have the brainpower to clean up our environment improve our quality of life spread innovation throughout our workplaces build twentyfirstcentury schools give americans longer life and better health eradicate bigotry and radically reduce poverty and we can spread political and economic freedom around the world doing so in a way that makes america the most admired not the most feared nation on earth i believe irsquove been called to service in 2004 as i hope this book will make clear in addressing six big challenges facing our country in the decade ahead please read what irsquove written here think argue and consider beyond these pages teresa and i will make ourselves an open book and offer a clear proposition for national leadership read us as well then join us in answering the call to service and taking the opportunity we have in 2004 to turn this country around together we can live up to the patriotism and courage americans show every day and make america the living proof of the possibilities of the human spirit that were the divine inspiration of our foundersmdashand of true leaders today
