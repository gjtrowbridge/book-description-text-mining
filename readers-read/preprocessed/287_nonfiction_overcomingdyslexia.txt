 i now want to gather together all the clues that combined will serve as an earlywarning system for recognizing dyslexia the clues will help you answer the question should my son or daughter or i be evaluated for dyslexia no one wants to be an 8220alarmist8221 and put her child through an evaluation for trivial or transient bumps along the road to reading evaluations can take time and those carried out privately can be expensive but i think we have to remind ourselves that our children are precious oneofakind individuals and have only one life to live if we elect not to evaluate a child and that child later proves to have dyslexia we cannot give those lost years back to him the human brain is resilient but there is no question that early intervention and treatment bring about more positive change at a faster pace than an intervention provided to an older child and then there is the erosion of selfesteem that accrues over the years as a child struggles to read childhood is a time for learning a child who delays breaking the phonetic code will miss much of the reading practice that is essential to building fluency and vocabulary as a consequence he will fall further and further behind in acquiring comprehension skills and knowledge of the world around him to see this happen to a child is sad all the more because it is preventable joseph torgesen a reading researcher at florida state university who has carried out many of the critical studies on intervention has this to say about the need to identify children early on and the cost of waiting to the extent that we allow children to fall seriously behind at any point during early elementary school we are moving to a 8220remedial8221 rather than a 8220preventive8221 model of intervention once children fall behind in the growth of critical word reading skills it may require very intensive interventions to bring them back up to adequate levels of reading accuracy and reading fluency may be even more difficult to restore because of the large amount of reading practice that is lost by children each month and year that they remain poor readers most parents and teachers delay evaluating a child with reading difficulties because they believe the problems are just temporary that they wll be outgrown this is simply not true reading poblems are notoutgrown they are persistent as the participants in the connecticut longitudinal study have demonstrated at least three out of four children who read poorly in third grade continue to have reading problems in high school and beyond what may seem to be tolerable and overlooked in a third grader certainly won8217t be in a high schooler or young adult without identification and proven interventions virtually all children who have reading difficulties early on will still struggle with reading when they are adults luckily parents can play an active role in the early identification of a reading problem all that is required is an observant parent who knows what she is looking for and who is willing to spend time with her child listening to him speak and read the specific signs of dyslexia both weaknesses and strengths in any one individual will vary according to the age and educational level of that person the fiveyearold who can8217t quite learn his letters becomes the sixyearold who can8217t match sounds to letters and the fourteenyearold who dreads reading out loud and the twentyfouryearold who reads excruciatingly slowly the threads persist throughout a person8217s life the key is knowing how to recognize them at different periods during development therefore i have gathered the clues together to provide three distinct portraits of dyslexia first in early childhood from preschool through first grade next in schoolage children from second grade on and last in young adults and adults clues to dyslexia in early childhood the earliest clues involve mostly spoken language the very first clue to a language and reading problem may be delayed language once the child begins to speak look for the following problems the preschool years 8226 trouble learning common nursery rhymes such as 8220jack and jill8221 and 8220humpty

further and sounded out as 8220 b 8221 8220 aaaa8221 8220 t 8221 8226 inability to learn to associate letters with sounds such as being unable to connect the letter b with the 8220 b 8221 sound 8226

portrait of dyslexia examine them carefully think about them and determine if any of these clues fit your child you or someone else you are close to look for clues in the weaknesses and strengths identifying the weaknesses makes it possible to spot dyslexia in children before they are expected to read and in adults after they have developed some degree of reading accuracy but are continuing to show the remnants of earlier problems reading slowly and with great effort if you think you or your child has some of these problems it is important to note how frequent they are and how many there are you don8217t need to worry about isolated clues or ones that appear very rarely for you to be concerned the symptoms must be persistent anyone can mispronounce a word now and then or confuse similarsounding words occasionally what you are looking for is a persistent pattern8211the occurrence of a number of these symptoms over a prolonged period of time that represents a likelihood of dyslexia
