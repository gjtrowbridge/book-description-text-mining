 on the day he died rakis 151 the planet commonly known as dune 151 died with him dune lost forever in the archives chamber of the fleeing noship ithaca the ghola of miles teg reviewed the desert worlds final moments melangescented steam wafted from a stimulant beverage at his left elbow but the thirteenyearold ignored it descending instead into deep mentat focus these historical records and holoimages held great fascination for him this was where and how his original body had been killed how a whole world had been murdered rakis 133 legendary desert planet now no more than a charred ball projected above a flat table the archival images showed honored matre war vessels gathering above the mottled tan globe the immense undetectable noships 151 like the stolen one aboard which teg and his fellow refugees now lived 151 wielded firepower superior to anything the bene gesserit had ever employed traditional atomics were little more than a pinprick by comparison those new weapons must have been developed out in the scattering teg pursued a simple mentat projection human ingenuity born out of desperation or was it something else entirely in the floating image the bristling ships opened fire unleashing incineration waves with devices the bene gesserit had since named obliterators the bombardment had continued until the planet was devoid of life the sandy dunes were turned to black glass even rakiss atmosphere caught fire giant worms and sprawling cities people and sand plankton everything annihilated nothing could have survived down there not even him now nearly fourteen years later and in a vastly changed universe the gangly teenager adjusted the study chair to a more comfortable height reviewing the circumstances of my own death again by strict definition teg himself was a clone rather than a ghola grown of cells gathered from a dead body though that was the word most people used to describe him inside his young flesh lived an old man a veteran of numerous campaigns for the bene gesserit he could not remember the last few moments of his life but these records left little doubt the senseless annihilation of dune demonstrated the true ruthlessness of the honored matres whores the sisterhood called them and for good reason nudging the intuitive finger controls he called up the images yet again it felt odd to be an outside observer knowing that he himself had been down there fighting and dying when these images were recorded133 teg heard a sound at the door of the archives and saw sheeana watching him from the corridor her face was lean and angular her skin brown from a rakian heritage her unruly umber hair flashed with streaks of copper from a childhood spent under the desert sun her eyes were the total blue of lifelong melange consumption as well as the spice agony that had turned her into a reverend mother the youngest ever to survive teg had been told sheeanas generous lips held an elusive smile studying battles again miles its a bad thing for a military commander to be so predictable i have a great many of them to review teg answered in his cracking youngmans voice the bashar accomplished a great deal in three hundred standard years before i died when sheeana recognized the projected record her expression fell into a troubled mask teg had watched those images of rakis to the point of obsession since they had fled into this bizarre and uncharted universe any word from duncan yet he asked trying to divert her attention he was attempting a new navigation algorithm to get us away from151 we know exactly where we are sheeana lifted her chin in an unconscious gesture she had come to use more and more often since becoming the leader of this group of refugees we are lost teg automatically intercepted the criticism of duncan idaho it had been their intent to prevent anyone 151 the honored matres the corrupted bene gesserit order or the mysterious enemy 151 from finding the ship at least were safe sheeana did not seem convinced so many unknowns trouble me our location who is chasing us133 her voice trailed off and then she said i will leave you to your studies we are about to have another meeting to discuss our situation he perked up has anything changed no miles and i expect the same arguments over and over again she shrugged the other sisters seem to insist on it with a quiet rustle of robes she exited the archives chamber leaving him with the humming silence of the great invisible ship back to rakis back to my death 133 and the events leading up to it teg rewound the recordings gathering old reports and perspectives and watched them yet again traveling farther backward in time now that his ghola memories had been awakened he knew what he had done up to his death he did not need these records to see how the old bashar teg had gotten into such a predicament on rakis how he himself had provoked it back then he and his loyal men 151 veterans of his many famous campaigns 151 had stolen a noship on gammu a planet that history had once called giedi prime homeworld of the evil but longexterminated house harkonnen years earlier teg had been brought in to guard the young ghola of duncan idaho after eleven previous duncan gholas had been assassinated the old bashar succeeded in keeping the twelfth alive until adulthood and finally restored duncans memories then helped him escape from gammu when one of the honored matres murbella tried to sexually enslave duncan he instead trapped her with unsuspected abilities wired into him by his tleilaxu creators it turned out that duncan was a living weapon specifically designed to thwart the honored matres no wonder the enraged whores were so desperate to find and kill him after slaughtering hundreds of honored matres and their minions the old bashar hid among men who had sworn their lives to protect him no great general had commanded such loyalty since paul muaddib perhaps even since the fanatical days of the butlerian jihad amidst drinks food and mistyeyed nostalgia the bashar had explained that he needed them to steal a noship for him though the task seemed impossible the veterans never questioned a thing133 ensconced in the archives now young miles reviewed surveillance records from gammus spaceport security images taken from tall guild bank buildings in the city each step of the assault made perfect sense to him even as he studied the records many years later it was the only way to succeed and we accomplished it133 after flying to rakis teg and his men had found reverend mother odrade and sheeana riding a giant old worm to meet the noship out in the great desert time was short the vengeful honored matres would be coming apoplectic because the bashar had made fools of them on gammu on rakis he and his surviving men departed the noship with armored vehicles and extra weapons time for one last but vital engagement before the bashar led his loyal soldiers out to face the whores odrade casually but expertly scratched the skin of his leathery neck notsosubtly collecting cell samples both teg and the reverend mother understood it was the sisterhoods last chance to preserve one of the greatest military minds since the scattering they realized he was about to die miles tegs final battle by the time the bashar and his men clashed with honored matres on the ground other groups of the whores were swiftly taking over the rakian population centers they slew the bene gesserit sisters who remained behind in keen they killed the tleilaxu masters and the priests of the divided god the battle was already lost but teg and his troops hurled themselves against the enemy defenses with unparalleled violence since honored matre hubris would not allow them to accept such humiliation the whores retaliated against the whole world destroying everything and everyone there including him in the meantime the old bashars fighters had created a diversion so the noship could escape carrying odrade the duncan ghola and sheeana who had tempted the ancient sandworm into the vessels cavernous cargo hold soon after the ship flew to safety rakis was destroyed 151 and that worm became the last of its kind that had been tegs first life his real memories ended there
