it is often said that america invented democracy this view is of course an understatement america invented not only democracy but freedom justice liberty and timesharing but representative democracy is unquestionably our proudest achievement the creation most uniquely our own even if the rest of the western world would have come up with the idea themselves by the 1820s so why then has participation in this most wondrous system withered as heirs to a legacy more than two centuries old it is understandable why presentday americans would take their own democracy for granted a president freely chosen from a wideopen field of two men every four years a congress with a 99 incumbency rate a supreme court comprised of nine politically appointed judges whose only oversight is the icy scythe of death151 all these reveal a system fully capable of maintaining itself but our perfect democracy which neither needs nor particularly wants voters is a rarity it is important to remember there still exist many other forms of government in the world today and that dozens of foreign countries still long for a democracy such as ours to be imposed on them to regain our sense of perspective and wonder we must take a broader historical view looking beyond americas relatively recent success story to examine our predecessors and their adorable failures in this chapter we will briefly explore the evolution of an idea following the hms democracy on her dangerous voyage through the mists of time past the straits of monarchy surviving hurricane theocracy then navigating around the cape of good feudal system to arrive battered but safe at her destined portofcall americatown early man more animal than political the human race is by nature brutal amoral unreasonable and selfcentered but for the first few hundred thousand years of our existence as a species we were way too obvious about it primitive culture centered on survival of the individual and occasionally survival of someone the individual might want to reproduce with see 1981s harrowing documentary caveman civic institutions were nonexistent as was debate which would appear later after the invention of the frontal lobe for prehistoric man the rule of law such as it was could best be summed up by the seminal case marburys head v madisons rock early man lived this tenuous darwinian nightmare for an age or two until a peculiar thing happened the unfittest decided they wouldnt mind surviving either the feeble and weak realized that without a good plan they werent going to make it out of the stone age to see the wonder that was clay alone they were mammoth meat together they would become a force with a chance to see the day when their childrens children would be only 75 covered in hair from these noble impulses the groundwork for the first civilizations was laid athens our big fat greek forerunners ancient greece is widely credited with creating the worlds first democracy it would be a worthy endeavor to travel back in time to the fetastrewn shores of fifthcentury bc athens and ask plato to define democracy and not only to make money gambling on olympics results that we being from the future would already know plato would tell us in that affectionate but nonsexual way of his that democracy is a greek word combining the roots for people demos and rule kratia in greek democracy political power was concentrated not in the hands of one person or even a small group of people but rather evenly and fairly distributed among all the people 1 meaning every john q publikopolous could play a role in athenian government the main legislative body the assembly was comprised of no less than the first 6000 citizens to arrive at its meetings151and bear in mind no saving seats jury duty was considered an honor to be vied for membership in most other civic institutions including the supreme court was chosenby lot imagine a system in which anyone could wind up serving on the supreme court anyone think about your own family friends the guys you knew in college who would eat dog feces for ten dollars now picture one of them as your randomly chosen chief justice and youll appreciate just how fuckedup this system was compared with american democracy the athenian version seems simplistic naive and gay transcripts of early athenian policy debates reveal a populace moved more by eloquence and rationality than demagogues and fearmongering thankfully this type of humane governance wasnt allowed to take root athenss great experiment ended after less than two centuries when in 338 bc philip of macedons forces invaded the city inflicting on its inhabitants the eternal fate of the noble and enlightened to be brutally crushed by the armed and dumb rome the first republicans the fall of athens was followed by the emergence overnight of rome at first glance its people 2 appear to have enjoyed a system of representative government similar to ours true behind its faade of allegedly representative officials iurked a de facto oligarchy ruled by entrenched plutocrats but the similarities dont end there in fact the founding fathers borrowed many of their ideas from the roman model including its bicameral legislature its emphasis on republicanism and civic virtue and its freudian fascination with big white columns however there was very little real democracy in rome while the senate theoretically represented the people in reality its wealthy members covertly pursued probusiness legislation on behalf of such militaryindustrial giants as javelincorp united crucifix and a cartel of resourceexploiting companies known as big aqueduct they even monopolized the most notorious aspect of roman life instituting an orgy policy that can literally be described as trickledown vomitoriums aside romes biggest contribution to american government was probably its legal system which codified key concepts like equal protection innocent until proven guilty and the right to confront ones accusers these very same issues would later form the basis of both the bill of rights and a mindnumbing quantity of law and order scripts but by the time of romes huge millennium celebration marking the beginning of o ad the faint light of roman democracy was all but extinguished the republic had given way to empire the only voting to speak of took place in the colosseum and was generally limited to a handful of disembowelmentrelated issues in time the empire itself fell as history teaches us all empires inevitably must 3 its most enduring legacy a numerical system that allowed future generations to more easily keep track of super bowls the magna carta power to the extremely wealthy people and then darkness for more than 1000 years democracy disappeared from the european scene the period instead saw the blossoming of an exciting array of alternate forms of government such as monarchy absolute monarchy kingship queenhood and three different types of oppression religiousethnicfor shits and giggles as for individual liberty innocent until proven guilty was rapidly supplanted by a more aggressive lawandorder approach better characterized as guilty until proven flammable democracy had disappeared the people needed a champion and as is usually the case the obscenely rich rode to the rescue in 1215 englands wealthy barons refused to give king john the money he needed to wage war unless he signed the magna carta the document codified that no man was above the law unfortunately for the peasant class it did little to address how many were below it startlingly ahead of its time this extraordinary document had a profound effect on people 4 and continues to shape twentyfirstcentury views on topics as diverse as escheat socage burage novel disseisin and the bailiwicks of gerard of athee but even more importantly the magna carta set a powerful precedent for our own founding fathers there was no more powerful means of safeguarding individual liberty than a vaguely worded manifesto inked in inscrutable cursive on dilapidated parchment the magna carta served as a wakeup call that europe would be forced to answerin about five hundred years for lady democracy having lain dormant for more than a millennium had risen from its slumber only to stretch its arms reach for the clock and groggily set the snooze bar for the enlightenment the 17th and 18th centuries enlightening strikes though a promising development for democracy the magna carta was mostly ignored as the world plunged into what would be known as the dark ages it was an apt title for an era when amoebic dysentery was considered the good kind of dysentery oppression and high mortality rates seemed ready to swallow what remained of mankind when through the darkness emerged the light that would be its salvation reason it began slowly hey what if we stop storing the corpses in the drinking water and see if that makes any difference to our health from there it gathered momentum soon all conventional wisdom from the shape of the earth to whether the ruling class could have your hut burned and your organs removed because they thought you caused an eclipse was up for grabs this last question proved especially pertinent for the future of democracy and ushered in an era known as the enlightenment the enlightenment with its emphasis on reason would finally provide democracy with its philosophical underpinnings the 17th and 18th centuries produced a wave of prominent thinkers espousing political systems based on what they called the social contract government they theorized was a sort of legal agreement between the rulers and the ruled the terms of which were binding on both parties it was a groundbreaking theory all they needed now was some country dumb enough to try it before the king found out and had them all drawn and quartered democracy needed a fresh start151hearty and idealistic champions who would strike out for a new world willing to risk everything for the principles of equality liberty justice and slaves wed need some slaves and guns but were getting ahead of ourselves a new world awaited 1 for purposes of greece people means free adult males 2 for purposes of rome people means free adult males with property 3 except america 4 for the purposes of the magna carta people means free adult males with property who
