 he didn8217t look dangerous not at first glance still a girl can never be too careful on a blind date and that8217s why i8217d insisted mr sand meet me in a popular steak house nestled in a casino dead center on the las vegas strip it was i8217d thought the most public of all public places yet now watching the way shadows from the muted lighting sought out the unhealthy hollows beneath his eyes and cheeks and the way he toyed with his blue cheese and endive appetizer 8211 identical to the one i8217d scarfed down in seconds 8211 i decided the most ominous thing about mr sand was a deeply embedded issue with selfcontrol and the only thing i was in danger of dying from was boredom of course that was before i really knew him and before my death the very next day at the time i had no way of knowing mr sand8217s true intentions not like now besides who knew homicidal maniacs came wrapped in horsefaced packages with little to no fashion sense beyond that he was so skinny his adam8217s apple bobbed like a buoy above the opening of his pressed shirt while knobby bones protruded at both knuckles and wrists ichabod crane in a poorly fitted suit not exactly intimidating looks aside the next mark against him was his first name 8220ajax8221 i repeated as our soups arrived not quite sure i8217d heard right he nodded lifting his spoon though i noted he didn8217t actually use it 8220ajax8221 8220like the cleaner8221 his smile was tight 8220like the greek warrior8221 i mean really cursing my sister for setting me up on yet another blind date 8211 cursing myself for letting her 8211 i nevertheless tried to plant my feet firmly on the bright side of things at least this one could walk without dragging his knuckles on the ground and even if the woman in me had recoiled at first sight at least the photographer in me had something to do i tried to picture ajax in a bank as he8217d already told me how the world8217s financial industry would fall flat on its ass without him but i couldn8217t quite imagine him languishing in repose behind a desk there was too much movement too much latent energy in those snaking limbs for that his fingers twined and untwined his bony elbows rose to rest on the table only to drop a second later and his eyes darted around the dining room taking in everything but never fully settling i8217d like to still those relentless limbs with my camera i decided take time to study those shifting eyes see just who mr sand became when seen in two dimensions instead of three he looked at me like he knew what i was thinking and it was that look those eyes that sent up the first red flag i don8217t mean the color a blue so light it was nearly transparent but more the way they tried to own me i licked my lips and they dropped to watch my tongue dart out i ran a hand through my bobbed hair and felt him following the movement so that my fingers fisted there i exhaled deeply forcing myself to relax and for some reason that made him smile i was jumpy i confess but i recognized that hungry look i8217d seen it once before long before i8217d ever started dating i8217d hoped never to see it again 8220so what do you do for a living8221 ajax finally asked breaking the silence 8220i mean you dont just live off daddys money do you8221 this was followed by a shallow 8216just joking8217 guffaw one belied by how carefully he continued to watch me i ran my fingers over the stem of my wine glass wondering just how long it would take ajax to notice that mine weren8217t the hands of a debutante but those of a fighter 8220i take photographs8221 8220like weddings or models or something8221 8220like people shapes shadows usually night shots using natural lighting and gritty settings reality8221 8220so8221 he said drawing the word out 8220you don8217t make money at it8221 8220not yet8221 he looked at me like i should apologize for something he probably was a fucking banker after all 8220sounds like a waste of time8221 he finally said and turned away from my stare his little jab stung more than it should have normally i don8217t care what people think but lately looking at the world through a refracted lens viewing the worth of places and people and objects in terms of light and shadow black and white wasn8217t as satisfying as it used to be restless i had recently begun taking more selfportraits than anything else zeroing in on singular things like my knuckles constantly red and calloused from nylon punching bags or my eyes right or left rarely both which were tawny and earthcolored during the day but blackened like a clouded lake in the dark or when i was extremely angry instead of looking for enemies in the faces of strangers i8217d begun turning the camera on myself and i didn8217t need freud or jung or even dr phil to tell me i was searching for something question was would i like what i eventually found 8220banking on the other hand8221 i began sweetly once the server had delivered our entrees 8220sounds absolutely captivating please don8217t skip one fascinating little detail8221 ajax8217s mouth creased even thinner than his hairline 8220god i should have known by looking that you8217re nothing like your sister8221 i didn8217t really consider it an insult but i was sure my eyes had gone black as tar 8220and how exactly do you know what my sister8217s like8221 8220i read her profile in playboy8221 he said nastily and shoved some saffron potatoes into his mouth i in turn settled my own fork on the side of my plate so that was it though similar in build olivia and i had taken vastly different approaches to both our sexuality and our lives the issue ajax was referring to had come out three months earlier and while i didn8217t approve of olivia8217s overt approach to sexuality i understood the reason behind it ironically enough it stemmed from the same origin as my own good ol8217 ajax here had probably also read the recent article about the archer family empire in fortunes and fates magazine 8216lacking the acute business sense of her gaming magnate father xavier the article had read and the brilliant social acumen of her glamorous sister olivia and indeed any notably positive attributes whatsoever ms joanna archer seems to have eschewed her public duty as one of the richest heiresses on the planet for a life of frivolity and selfinterest8217 selfinterest i could understand but frivolous like writing scathing gossip columns about other people8217s lives was brain surgery so it seemed my sister hadn8217t given ajax my phone number in all probability olivia didn8217t know him at all apparently he8217d been counting on someone who looked and acted like a playmate and hoping perhaps i did have some redeeming social qualities perhaps my reported selfinterest along with my inheritance could be funneled his way perhaps he8217d have a chance with the token black sheep of the archer dynasty wrong ajax i thought picking up my wine glass on all accounts 8220look8221 he said spreading his hands before him as though discussing stock options 8220i just came to vegas for a good time i thought i8217d look you up since we seem to have some of the same interests8221 aka my money 82208230and see if you wouldn8217t mind showing me around that8217s all why can8217t we just have some fun8221 when i only continued to stare he dropped his bony elbows on the table with a force that shook the plates and abandoned all pretext of civility 8220or fine why don8217t you pretend that you have a sense of humor8221 8220i could8221 i said nodding slowly 8220but then i8217d have been laughing from the moment you walked in the door8221 see my sense of humor was as broad as anyone else8217s 8220bitch8221 i drew back at the venom in his voice surprised my words had cut so deeply so quickly then again a fuse that short had probably been lit long before i came along 8220what8217s wrong ajax things not going according to plan let me guess here you are in vegas on some sort of pilgrimage to forget for one weekend exactly how disappointing your life has turned out and now mean spoiled joanna archer is screwing it all up is that about right8221 i have this ability i like to think of it as a gift really to see clean through to people8217s sore spots i hone in on a bruised psyche and press not nice i know but then olivia was the miss congeniality in our family ajax8217s reptilian features had rearranged themselves as i spoke and he now looked like a glowering python 8220thanks for the psychoanalysis babe8221 he spat 8220but all i really wanted from this weekend were a couple of easy lays8221 this i assumed was where i was supposed to throw my wine in his face i didn8217t though i liked chateau le pin and took a long considering sip of the vintage 821682 i8217d made him buy me 8220and what your mother wasn8217t available8221 ajax8217s head jerked like i8217d struck him and the fidgeting that had accompanied the entire social farce abruptly ceased suddenly a different man sat there it was like the still picture i8217d imagined before a person comfortable in his skin a warrior living up to his name surprisingly i was the first to blink 8220you like to argue8221 he said and it wasn8217t a question 8220you like to fight8221 he was right i did but suddenly i wasn8217t exactly sure what i was up against 8220insult my mother again8221 he said in a ragged whisper 8220and you8217ll find yourself in a fight for your life8221 and just like that a bolt of lightning seared over the gilded room arching across the beveled ceiling to snap like fangs between us the air was a livewire crackling so the lights wall sconces even the candles flickered as if flinching and an invisible force funneled around us sucking all the energy in the room toward our table and leaving me breathless there in the eye of that storm i watched the flimsy skin layering ajax8217s bones melt away altering his face into a slab of bone teeth and cavernously slanting eyes his smooth skull grinned at me across the table eyes aflame while a banshee8217s howl sprung from the gaping mouth i was half out of my seat before i caught myself before i blinked 8230 and the bony aging banker returned staring at me benignly nobody else in the room had moved nobody screamed classical music pulsed softly from artfully hidden speakers and the steady thrum of conversation and clinking utensils blanketed the unnatural howl still rebounding in my mind the table wasn8217t spliced or singed and the vanilla taper winked softly between us ajax chuckled his voice rumbling like thunder in his thin chest i stared at him but it was as if an invisible curtain had risen between us and i sensed nothing of his thoughts no bruised ego no unveiled sore spots to push my little intuitive gift it seemed had abandoned me completely i did know one thing though the bumbling tourist act was just that an act the man who sat before me was cruel possibly insane and most assuredly dangerous 8220what8217s wrong joanna dear seeing things something maybe that reminds you of a sweltering summer night shadows lunging at you from the desert floor perhaps8221 a tremor inched its way up my spine and for the first time in a long while i was at a loss of what to do i was a frozen hare beneath that gaze and ajax simply waited like a skilled predator i could call the maitre8217d or security i thought have ajax eightysixed from the restaurant and casino never allowed to return again though i wasn8217t sure what reason i8217d give that i was having a bad time on this date that the man before me had just flashed me with his freakin8217 skeleton that a monster really lurked beneath this flaccid aging exterior or that he knew something about me no one had a right to know 8220i told them it was you you know8221 he said picking at his dryaged black angus 8220they didn8217t believe me they said it was too obvious but i knew i could scent you the moment you walked in the door8221 i forced myself to focus on that 8220scent me8221 8220yes you smell like the desert sage in full bloom after a summer storm8221 he wrinkled his nose before turning haughty again 8220but you don8217t even know that do you you haven8217t been told who you are or a single thing about your lineage in fact i8217d say you8217re about as helpless as an abandoned babe without a tit to suck8221 he laughed and leaned in even further closing the short distance between us i battled the urge to run from the room like a screaming child and instead sat my ground as he8217d said i was a fighter 8220now i8217m going to give you something else to psychoanalyze joanna archer it8217ll probably be one of the most important things you ever learn so pay careful attention8221 he licked his lips eyes steady on mine 8220pheromones do you know what they are8221 thrown by the change of topic i nonetheless forced a nonchalant shrug 8220a chemical a scent animals give off to attract others of the same species so8221 8220not only the same species different species as well opposites enemies8221 he let the last word linger on his tongue slipping the syllables out the same way a priest would slip the sacrament in i stared at those thin lips wondering where he was going with this where i fit in and how i8217d made an enemy out of a man i8217d never met could he really be that sensitive about his mother 8220see joanna you have an extra component to your biological mix it8217s weak true not yet fully developed but it8217s there like a rose not yet grown from bud to bloom or8221 here he paused to draw in a deep breath then exhaled slowly as if he found it sweet 8220like the invisible note of fear a fox leaves behind as it flees a chase8221 my pulse points began to trip hot and fast anorexic demon or not he did not want to get me started on hunting and being hunted i8217d nearly a lifetime of experience of being one or the other and there was a chip on my shoulder about it the size of a small state 8220see i8217m like the hound anxious to get on with the chase and with a nose so precise i could drive you to the end of the earth8221 he smiled serenely 8220guess what that makes you8221 8220the hound master8221 the humor fell from his face again and thunder rumbled along the walls this time i was prepared though and didn8217t flinch ajax opened his mouth to say something but changed his mind instead he took a slow sip from his glass of wine swirling it languidly in its crystal bowl i watched transfixed by a single bloodred drop studding his pale bottom lip the lips moved 8220lesson number one know thy enemy8221 and he blew outwards blended with the lacy texture of aged bordeaux was a scent so fetid it brought bile to my throat it was toxic decay a concentration of acidity and rot rising so sharply the fumes burned the lining from my nose i coughed covering my lower face but kept my eyes on his while trying to process what my nose was telling me it was him he was somehow emitting or spewing his essence onto my senses and my nose never this sensitive before told me he was dead inside decomposing even as we sat there 8220now you8217ll know me forever both where i go and where i8217ve been8221 he smiled again and his grin was as rancid and spoilt as his fermented breath 8220even the mere thought of me will conjure my scent in your mind8221 i forced myself to swallow back the last of the bile 8220it8217ll be a link between us8221 he continued winking obscenely 8220my gift to you8221 8220i don8217t know what you8217re talking about8221 i said palm still cupped over my mouth and i didn8217t but i could suddenly smell him everywhere why hadn8217t i been able to moments before and how could everyone else consume food in a place that reeked of death and decay 8220you don8217t know do you and that8217s going to make it all the more precious when i kill you8221 his fingers twined untwined 8220i just love to kill the innocent8221 slowly i lowered my hand from my face i8217d been called a number of things in my adult life but innocent had never been one of them neither for that matter had passive folding my arms across my chest i let my fingers curl into fists 8220and how exactly do you intend on doing that8221 8220with my right hand8221 he said pleased i8217d asked 8220and the serrated poker beneath my jacket8221 he lifted one side of his coat and my breath lodged somewhere between my throat and chest cavity sure enough a multihooked blade as long and thin as a fencer8217s sword glinted in the candlelight winking at me he lowered the lapel all around us hushed chatter continued an incongruous contrast to the stillness that had slowed every cell of my body i lifted my eyes and this time i didn8217t have to blink the monster was there even if i was the only one who could see him 8220now get up8221 he said 8220and slowly walk to the door8221 8220fuck you8221 no way was i going to let this crackerjack near my back 8230 even if every instinct in my body was crying out for me to bolt and quick i might be able to outrun him he certainly didn8217t look fast but then he hadn8217t looked psychotic either 8220get up8221 he repeated louder 8220or i will kill every person in this dining room starting with the woman behind me8221 my eyes flicked to the woman in question a petite blonde with hair piled fashionably atop her head to reveal a creamy white nape her back was to us her head momentarily tilted back in a soundless laugh with that thin barbed blade ajax could rend the tendons from her neck before she8217d even caught her next breath her companion a handsome man with sparkling eyes caught me looking and smiled i looked away it was the smile of a person never touched by violence a look i8217d never worn in my adult life i doubted my dinner partner ever had either 8220i don8217t care8221 i lied returning ajax8217s stare he laughed as if we too were enjoying a pleasant evening in each other8217s company 8220of course you do see that8217s why you8217re the good guy and i8217m the bad guy8221 the humor dropped from his face along with his voice 8220now get your ass out of that chair8221 i remained seated the smooth white bones beneath his cheeks flashed then there was the slight rustle of fabric the unmistakable chink of a weapon being unsheathed beneath the table and ajax8217s shoulder rotated in a motion that would end in a killing blow my stomach clenched but still i didn8217t move he growled and it was an expectant warning sound 8220wait8221 i said as his muscles tensed he stared back at me with those soulless eyes and i knew he8217d have done it he8217d have killed that woman without blinking and the man across from her would never smile again 8220see8221 ajax said quietly 8220i told you you8217re one of the good guys8221 i didn8217t answer just pushed away from the table and rose my eyes never leaving his but then i did something even i couldn8217t have anticipated i picked up my wine glass swirled and put it to my lips perhaps it was the intensity of the moment or maybe ajax8217s lesson in odorous acuity really had hit home but the flavors i inhaled from that glass were the most complex the most vibrant and the richest i8217d ever tasted i could scent the clay of the plateau vineyard in france where the fruit had been harvested and somehow i knew the grapes had been picked on a windless rainy day the juice had been aged in french oak and the winemaker had regularly tested the barrel with a steel ladle his artist8217s palate telling him when exactly to go to bottle inhaling all these things things i had no right to sense or see they became a part of me their knowledge burrowing into my bones i drank deeply almost ecstatically like the saints you see on the ceilings of cathedrals the martyrs looking expectantly toward heaven in their final lingering moments on earth all the while ajax watched me with those glassy deatheyes like he could tell exactly what i was doing and feeling and tasting i lowered the glass as he had done earlier then blew in his direction he froze alarm furrowing his brow i don8217t know what he scented of me just then but it wasn8217t the fear he so clearly expected still he regained his composure quickly and jerked his head toward the exit unwilling to let go of the wine that still held so much life and passion and vitality in it i turned with it still in my hand then fingering the stem like a nun with her favorite rosary beads i slowly made my way out the door
