 chapter one at femme magazine something had been in the air for weeks a feeling that they were living on a fault line speculation finally burst into flames when it was confirmed that calvin carter the us managing director had been sighted roaming around the top floor looking for the gents apparently hed just arrived in london from the head office in new york its happening lisa clenched her fists in excitement its actually finally bloody happening later that day the phone call came would lisa pop upstairs to see calvin carter and british managing director barry hollingsworth lisa slammed down the phone too right i would she shouted at it her colleagues barely looked up people slamming phones down then shouting were ten a penny in the magazine game besides they were trapped in deadline hell if they didnt get this months issue put to bed by nightfall theyd miss their slot with the printers and would be scooped once again by archrivals marie claire but what did she care lisa thought hobbling to the lift she wouldnt have a job here after today shed have a much better one somewhere else lisa was kept waiting outside the boardroom for twentyfive minutes after all barry and calvin were very important men should we let her in yet barry asked calvin when he felt theyd killed enough time its only twenty minutes since we called her calvin pointed out huffily obviously barry hollingsworth didnt realize just how important he calvin carter was sorry i thought it was later perhaps youd show me again how to improve my swing sure now head down and hold still hold still feet steady left arm straight and swing when lisa was finally granted admission barry and calvin were seated behind a walnut table approximately a kilometer long they looked frowningly powerful sit down lisa calvin carter inclined his silver bullet head graciously lisa sat she smoothed back her caramelcolored hair showing her free honeycolored highlights to their best advantage free because she kept plugging the salon in the ones to watch section of the magazine settling herself in the chair she tucked her patrick coxshod feet neatly around each other the shoes were a size too small no matter how many times she asked the patrick cox press office to send a size six they always sent a five but free patrick cox shoes were free patrick cox shoes what did an unimportant detail like excruciating agony matter thank you for coming up calvin smiled lisa decided shed better smile back smiles were a commodity like everything else only given in exchange for something useful but she reckoned in this case it was worth her while after all it wasnt every day that a girl was seconded to new york and made deputy editor of manhattan magazine so she curled her mouth and bared her pearlywhite teeth kept that way from the years supply of rembrandt toothpaste that had been donated for a reader competition but which lisa had thought would be more appreciated in her own bathroom youve been at femme for calvin looked at the stapled pages in front of him four years four years next month lisa murmured with an expertly judged mix of deference and confidence and youve been editor for nearly two years two wonderful years lisa confirmed fighting back the urge to stick her fingers down her throat and gag and youre only twentynine calvin marveled well as you know here at randolph media we reward hard work lisa twinkled prettily at this patent lie like many companies in the western world randolph media rewarded hard work with poor pay increasing workloads demotions and onasecondsnotice redundancies but lisa was different shed paid her dues at femme and made sacrifices that even shed never intended to make starting at seventhirty most mornings doing twelve thirteen fourteenhour days then going to evening press dos when she finally switched off her computer often she came to work on saturdays sundays even bankholiday mondays the porters loathed her because it meant that whenever she wanted to come to the office one of them had to come in and open up and thereby forgo their saturday football or their bankholiday family outing to brent cross we have a vacancy at randolph media calvin said importantly it would be a wonderful challenge lisa i know she thought irritably just cut to the chase it will involve moving overseas which can sometimes be a problem for ones partner im single lisa was brusque barry wrinkled his forehead in surprise and thought of the termer hed had to hand over for someones wedding present a few years before he could have sworn it was for lisa here but maybe not perhaps he wasnt as on the ball as he once used to be were looking for an editor for a new magazine calvin went on a new magazine lisa was jotted off course but manhattan has been published for seventy years while she was still grappling with the implications of that calvin delivered the whammy it would involve your relocating to dublin the shock set up a smothered buzzing in her head as if her ears needed to pop a numb fuzzy sensation of alienation the only reality was the sudden agony of her crumpled toes dublin she heard her muffled voice ask perhaps perhaps perhaps they meant dublin new york dublin ireland calvin carter said down a long echoey tunnel destroying the last of her hope i cant believe this is happening to me ireland small wet place across the irish sea barry offered kindly where they drink a lot lisa said faintly and they never stop talking thats the place booming economy huge population of young folk market research indicates the place is ripe for a new feisty womens magazine and we want you to set it up for us lisa
