 prologue some said that if he was going to kill himself he couldnt have picked a better day for it life was hardly worth living that particular sunday afternoon and most organisms were doing a halfassed job of it the atmosphere was as thick and hot as breakfast grits it sucked the energy right out of every living thing be it plant or animal clouds evaporated under the ferocity of the sun moving from indoors to out was like stepping into a blast furnace like those in the hoyles foundry at the familys fishing camp on bayou bosquet so named because of the island of cypress trees in the middle of the creeks slowmoving current a stuffed sixfoot gator basked in the heat of the yard his glass eyes reflected the glare of the hot sky the louisiana state flag hung furled and limp upon its pole cicadas were too indolent to make their grating music although one industrious insect occasionally disturbed the somnolent atmosphere with an attempt that was halfhearted at best fish remained well below the surface of the water and its opaque green blanket of duckweed they kept to the shadowy murky depths their only sign of life being the periodic pulsing of gills a water moccasin lay inert on the bank menacing but motionless the swamp was a natural aviary but today every species of fowl seemed to be napping in its nest with the exception of a single hawk he was perched at the top of a tree that had been killed by a lightning strike decades before the elements had left its branches as naked and white as bones picked clean the winged hunter eyed the cabin below perhaps he spied the mouse skittering among the pilings that supported the fishing pier more likely animal instinct alerted him to imminent peril the crack of the gunshot wasnt as loud as one might expect the air dense as a goosedown pillow smothered the sound waves the shot created barely a ripple of reaction in the swamp the flag remained furled the stuffed gator didnt flinch making only a small splash the water moccasin slithered into the bayou not alarmed but piqued that his sunday slumber had been disturbed the hawk took flight spiraling on air currents with a minimum of effort on the lookout for prey more appealing than the small mouse darting among the pilings to the dead man inside the cabin the hawk gave no thought at all chapter one do you remember slap watkins who the guy who was spouting off in the bar can you be more specific what bar when the night you came to town that was three years ago yeah but you should remember chris hoyle sat forward in an attempt to goose his friends powers of recall the loudmouth who caused the fight face that would stop a clock big ears oh that guy right with the beck held his hands at the sides of his head to indicate large ears thats how he got the nickname slap chris said beck raised an eyebrow whenever the wind blew his ears slapped against his head beck finished like shutters in a gale grinning chris tilted his beer bottle in a silent toast the window blinds in the den of the hoyles home were drawn to block out the shimmering heat of a lateafternoon sun the closed blinds also made the room agreeably dim for better tv viewing a braves game was being televised top of the ninth and atlanta needed a miracle but despite the unfavorable score there were worse ways to spend a stifling sunday afternoon than inside a semidark airconditioned den sipping cold brews chris hoyle and beck merchant had idled away many hours in this room it was the perfect male playroom with its fiftyinch tv screen and surroundsound speakers it had a fully stocked bar with a builtin ice maker a refrigerator filled with soft drinks and beer a billiards table a dartboard and a round game table with six leather chairs as soft and cushy as the bosom of the cover girl on this months issue of maxim the room was paneled with stained walnut and furnished with substantial pieces that wore well and required little maintenance it smelled of tobacco smoke and reeked of testosterone beck uncapped another bottle of beer so what about this slap hes back i didnt know he was gone in fact i dont think ive seen him since that night and then i was looking at him through swelling eyes chris smiled at the memory as barroom brawls go that was a fairly good one you caught several of slaps wellplaced punches he was always handy with his fists he had to be because he shot off his mouth all the time probably defending against cruel cracks about his ears no doubt anyway that smart mouth of his kept him on everybodys fighting side soon after our altercation with him he got into a feud with his sisters exhusband over a lawn mower i think it was things came to a head one night at a crawfish boil and slap went after his exbrotherinlaw with a knife killed him flesh wound but it was right across the guys belly and drew enough blood to warrant an assault with a deadly weapon charge and probably should have been attempted murder slaps own sister testified against him hes been in angola for the past three years now out on parole lucky us chris frowned not really slaps got it in for us at least thats what he said that night three years ago when he was being hauled away in a squad car he thought it unfair that he was being arrested and we werent screamed invectives and threats that made my blood run cold i dont remember that that may have been when you were in the mens room nursing your wounds anyhow chris continued slap is an unstable and untrustworthy neerdowell a trailer trash bubba whose only talent is holding grudges and in that he excels we humiliated him that night and even drunk as he was i doubt hes forgiven and forgotten keep an eye out for him i consider myself warned beck glanced over his shoulder in the general direction of the kitchen am i invited to dinner standing invitation beck settled even more comfortably into the sofa on which he was sprawled good whatevers baking in there is making my mouth water coconut cream pie nobody can make a better pie than selma youll get no argument from me chris chriss father huff hoyle strode in fanning his ruddy face with his straw hat get me one of those longnecks im so damn thirsty i couldnt work up a spit if my dick was on fire he hung his hat on a coat tree then plopped down heavily in his recliner swiping his sleeve across his forehead damn its a scorcher today with a sigh he sank into the cool leather cushions of the chair thanks son he took the chilled bottle of beer chris had opened for him and pointed it toward the tv whos winning this ball game not the braves in fact its over beck muted the sound as the commentators began their postmortem of the game we dont need to hear why they lost the score says it all huff grunted in agreement their season was over the minute they let those highpaid nonenglishspeaking prima donna players start telling the owners how to run the show big mistake could have told them that he took a long swig of the beer nearly draining the bottle have you been playing golf all afternoon chris asked too hot huff said as he lit a cigarette we played three holes then said screw this and went back to the clubhouse to play gin rummy how much did you fleece them of today the question wasnt whether huff had won or lost he always won couple of hundred nice going chris said aint worth playing if you dont win he winked at his son then at beck he finished his beer in a gulp either of you heard from danny today hell show up here in a while chris said that is if he can work us in between sunday morning worship and sunday night vespers huff scowled dont get me in a bad mood by talking about that i dont want to spoil my dinner the gospel according to huff was that preaching praying and hymn singing were for women and men who might just as well be women he equated organized religion to organized crime except that churches had impunity and tax advantages and he had about as much intolerance for holy joes as he did for homosexuals and laborers with union cards chris tactfully steered the conversation away from his younger brother and his recent preoccupation with spiritual matters i was just telling beck that slap watkins is out on parole white trash huff muttered as he toed off his shoes that whole bunch starting with slaps granddaddy who was the lowest reprobate ever to draw breath they found him dead in a ditch with a broken whiskey bottle jammed in his throat he must have crossed somebody one time too many theres bound to have been some inbreeding in that family down to the last one of them theyre ugly as sin and dumber than stumps beck laughed maybe but i owe slap a debt of gratitude if it hadnt been for him i wouldnt be here sharing sunday dinner huff looked across at him with as much affection as he showed his own sons no beck you were meant to become one of us by hook or by crook finding you made that whole gene iverson mess worthwhile you were the only good thing to come out of it that and a hung jury chris said lets not forget those twelve if it werent for them i wouldnt be here sharing sunday dinner instead i could be sharing a cell with the likes of slap watkins chris often made light of having been put on trial for the murder of gene iverson his joking dismissal of the incident never failed to make beck uncomfortable as it did now he changed the subject i hate to bring up a business matter when it isnt even a workday in my book every days a workday huff said chris groaned not in my book its not is it bad news beck potentially then cant it wait till after supper sure if youd rather nope huff said you know my rule about bad news i want to hear it sooner rather than later i sure as hell dont want to wait through dinner so whats up beck dont tell me that weve been slapped with another fine by the epa over those cooling ponds no its not that not directly then what hold on im going to pour a drink first chris said to huff you like to hear bad news early i like to hear it with a glass of bourbon in my hand want one lots of ice no water beck im fine thanks chris moved to the bar and reached for a decanter and two glasses then leaning closer to the window he peered through the slats of the blinds and twirled the wand to open them wider what have we got here what is it huff asked sheriffs car just pulled up well what do you think he wants its payday chris still looking through the blinds said i dont think so huff hes got somebody with him who i dont know never saw him before chris finished pouring the drinks and brought one of them to his father but the three said nothing more as they listened to selma making her way from the kitchen at the back of the house to the front door to answer the bell the housekeeper greeted the callers but the exchange was too softly spoken for individual words to be understood footfalls approached the den selma appeared ahead of the guests mr hoyle sheriff harper is here to see you huff motioned for her to usher him in sheriff red harper had been elected to the office thirty years before his campaign substantially boosted and his win guaranteed by huffs pocketbook he had remained in office by the same means his hair which had been fiery in his youth had dulled as though it had rusted on his head he stood well over six feet tall but was so thin that the thick leather gun belt with the accoutrements of his job attached looked like an inner tube hanging on a fence post he looked wilted and not only because of the heat index outside his face was long and gaunt as though three decades of corruption had weighted it down with guilt his woebegone demeanor was that of a man who had sold his soul to the devil far too cheaply never jolly he seemed particularly downcast as he shuffled into the room and removed his hat by contrast the younger officer with him a stranger to them seemed to have been dipped in a vat of starch along with his uniform he was so closely shaven his cheeks were rosy with razor burn he looked as tense and alert as a sprinter in the blocks waiting for the starting gun red harper acknowledged beck with a slight nod then the sheriff looked toward chris who was standing beside huffs chair finally his bleak eyes moved to huff who had remained seated in his recliner evening red huff instead of looking directly at huff he focused on the brim of his hat which he was feeding through his fingers drink no thanks it wasnt huffs habit to stand up for anyone that was a show of respect reserved for huff hoyle alone and everybody in the parish knew it but impatient with the suspense he pushed down the footrest of his recliner and came to his feet whats going on whos this he gave the sheriffs spitandpolish companion a onceover red cleared his throat he lowered his hat to his side and nervously tapped it against his thigh he waited a long time before looking huff in the eye all of which signaled to beck that the sheriffs errand was much more consequential than picking up this months graft its about danny he began
