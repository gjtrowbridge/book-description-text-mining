 chapter one lust and a virtuous woman only a fool combined the two tristan wemyss fourth earl of trentham reflected that hed rarely been called a fool yet here he stood gazing out of a window at an undoubtedly virtuous lady and indulging in all manner of lustful thoughts understandable perhaps the lady was tall darkhaired and possessed a willowy subtly curvaceous figure displayed to advantage as strolling the back garden of the neighboring house she paused here and there bending to examine some foliage or flower in the lush and strangely riotous garden beds it was february the weather as bleak and chill as in that month it was wont to be yet the garden next door displayed abundant growth thick leaves in dark greens and bronzes from unusual plants that seemed to thrive despite the frosts admittedly there were trees and shrubs leafless and lifelorn scattered throughout the deep beds yet the garden exuded an air of winter life quite absent from most london gardens in that season not that he possessed any interest in horticulture it was the lady who held his interest with her gliding graceful walk with the tilt of her head as she examined a bloom her hair the color of rich mahogany was coiled in a coronet about her head he couldnt from this distance divine her expression yet her face was a pale oval features delicate and pure a wolfhound shaggy and brindlecoated snuffled idly at her heels it usually accompanied her whenever she wandered outside his instincts well honed and reliable informed him that today the ladys attention was perfunctory in abeyance that

he cast a last glance at the garden next door and saw a towheaded boy racing across the lawn toward the lady saw her turn see wait expectantly clearly the news shed been anticipating quite why he found her fascinating he had no idea he preferred blonds of more buxom charms and despite his desperate need of a wife the lady was too old to be still on the marriage mart she would certainly already
