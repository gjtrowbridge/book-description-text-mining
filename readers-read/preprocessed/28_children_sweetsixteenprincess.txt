 chapter one wednesday april 28 9 pm albert einstein high school gymnasium so lanas dad rented the sultan of bruneis tenmilliondollar yacht for the night and had lana and her friends driven out into international waters so they could drink without getting in trouble this is what lilly just called to tell me lilly i whispered you know you arent supposed to call me on my cell phone it is for emergency use only you dont think this is an emergency mia lanas dad renting the sultan of bruneis yacht like that that is a throwdown he is basically telling your grandmother to bring it i dont have the slightest idea what youre talking about because i dont and i have to go im at a pta meeting for crying out loud oh god i can hear the soundtrack for altar boyz in the background ever since lilly started going out with j p reynoldsabernathy the fourth she has gotten way into soundtracks from musicals because j ps dad is a theater producer and j p can get free tickets to any broadway show he wants and all of the offbroadway ones too and even the offoffbroadway ones i forgot you had to go to that stupid thing sorry im not there with you but well you know i did know lilly was serving the last week of a grounding her parents instituted after she was brought home by the nypd for attacking andy milonakis this kid from downtown whose cable access television show was picked up by mtv with a dojos side salad lilly believes andys getting a basic cable deal instead of her is a travesty of justice because her own local show lilly tells it like it is is so much better in her opinion as it isnt simply entertaining but also highlights facts she feels her viewers ought to be aware of such as the fact that the uss decision to withhold 34 million from the united nations population fund will lead to two million unwanted pregnancies 800000 induced abortions 4700 maternal deaths and 77000 infant and child deaths worldwide whereas a typical episode of andys show features him holding a jar of peanut butter in one hand a jar of salsa in the other then making the jars dance with each other lilly is also peeved that andy is deceiving the american public by allowing them to think he is just a kid when we both saw him coming out of dba which is a bar in the east village that cards so how did he get in there if he isnt at least twentyone this is what she asked him when she saw him eating a falafel at dojos health restaurant on st marks place and why she claims she was forced to hurl her side salad at him drenching him in tahini dressing and causing him to call the cops on her thankfully the drs moscovitz talked andys legal team out of pressing charges explaining that lilly has been experiencing some anger issues since their recent separation but that didnt stop them from grounding her so hows the meeting going lilly asked have they gotten to the youknowwhat part yet i wouldnt know because im too distracted talking to you i whispered i had to whisper because i was sitting in a folding chair in the middle of a row of very uptightlooking parents being new yorkers they were all of course very well dressed with prada accessories but being new yorkers they were also all angry about the fact that someone was using a cell phone while someone else namely principal gupta was up at the podium speaking also of course that principal gupta was basically saying she couldnt guarantee that their kids would get into yale or harvard which was making them madder than anything at 25000 a year which is how much tuition at aehs costs new york parents expect some return for their investment well ill let you go now so you can get back to work lilly said but just fyi lanas dad had her flown in to the yacht on the sultans helicopter so she could make a spectacular entrance i hope one of the blades cut her head off as she was getting out of it because she forgot to duck i whispered avoiding the glare of the lady in front of me who had turned in her seat to give me a dirty look for talking while principal gupta was giving everyone some very important information about the percentage of aehs graduates who get into ivy league colleges well lilly said no that didnt happen but i heard her azzedine ala239a skirt flew up over her head and everyone saw that she was wearing a thong goodbye lilly i said im just telling you turning sixteen is a big deal you only do it once dont blow it by having one of your stupid loft parties with the cheetos and mr g as a dj goodbye lilly i hung up just as the lady in the seat in front of me turned around to hiss would you please put away that but she never got to finish because lars who was sitting next to me casually opened his suit jacket revealing his sidearm he was only reaching for a listerine pocketpak but the sight of his glock 9 caused the ladys eyes to widen she closed her mouth and turned back around in her seat very quickly having an armed bodyguard follow you around everywhere you go can be a total pain in the butt particularly when it comes to finding private time with your boyfriend but there are moments like that one when it can actually rock then principal gupta asked if there was any outstanding business and i threw my arm into the air principal gupta saw me raise my hand i know she did
