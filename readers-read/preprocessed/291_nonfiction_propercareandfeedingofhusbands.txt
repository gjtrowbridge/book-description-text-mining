 introduction as a man i can tell you our needs are simple we want to be fed we want our kids mothered and we want lovin vince men are only interested in two things if im not horny make me a sandwich john i am a thirtysevenyearold man who has seen quite a bit in life and i can offer this to your search for how to treat a man we are men not dumbdumbs psychics or one bit unromantic we need only clear communication appreciation honest love and respect this will be repaid by laying the moon and stars at your feet for your pleasure there is no need to work a man to get what you want we live to take care of a wife family and home just remember that we are men and know that our needs are simple but not to be ignored a good man is hard to find not to keep dan a good man is hard to find not to keep that sentence should really make you stop and think as a radio talkshow hostpsychotherapist ive got to tell you how remarkably true and sad it is that so many women struggle to hold on to some jerk keep giving an abusive or philandering man yet another chance have unprotected sex with some guy while barely knowing his last name agree to shack up and risk making babies with some opportunist or loser all in a pathetic version of a pursuit for love but will resent the hell out of treating a decent hardworking caring husband with the thoughtfulness attention respect and affection he needs to be content it boggles my mind what further puts me in boggle overdrive is how seemingly oblivious and insensitive many women are to how destructive they are being to their men and consequently to their marriages women will call me asking me if its alright to go off on extended vacations without him when they want some freedom or rr or if its okay to cut him off from sex because theyre annoyed about something or just too tired from their busy day or if they really have to make him a dinner when he gets home from work because its just too tedious to plan meals or if its okay to keep stuff from him like family or financial issues because his input is unnecessary or if theyre really obligated to spend time with his family inlaws or stepkids or if they really have to show interest in his hobbies when theyre bored silly by them or well you get the idea let me relate the specific call that prompted me to write this book annette is thirtyfive her husband is thirtynine and they have a oneyearold son she is a stayathome mom who just doesnt enjoy cooking and doesnt feel its useful to spend a lot of time doing it she called wondering if that was detrimental or not to her child right away i was alerted to her lack of concern about the needs or desires of her husband you know the guy who slays dragons for her and their child every day in order to really get a feel for this caller youll have to imagine the completely hostile and disdainful manner in which she spoke dr laura what do you do for food annette we eat peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches dr laura thats not healthy three times a day annette no hes the child not eating it three times a day dr laura what do you eat for dinner annette well hes still breastfeeding at one year old dr laura what do the adults in your house eat for dinner annette my husband might eat beef enchiladas from the freezer and i might eat cereal or cottage cheese my husband doesnt much like what i cook dr laura thats not really a balanced healthy diet are you intentionally making awful things that he wont eat or is he some kind of ogre annette sarcastically no im just not a good cook what you cant read is her disdainful hostile tone dr laura okay annette being a better cook is easy to come by all you do is take a class or get a book of recipes i wonder if youre intentionally undermining his enjoyment of a homecooked meal so that you simply dont have to do it let me tell you what is detrimental to your child dinnertime turns out to be one of the most important functions of a family in terms of a child bonding with parents their ability to communicate and feel close to their parents all of which supports their selfesteem the dinner table is a most important aspect of that bonding that is the routine time when the family sits down says their prayers and spends that pleasant time enjoying their meal together and talking so if that means you have to do what you dont like so be it or did you plan to teach your son that when he doesnt enjoy something he doesnt have to do it at all or he doesnt have to do it right in which case you are going to have a child growing up to be a monster there are a lot of things we all dont enjoy doing but they are part of the rigor of life and they are a part of our obligations in our various roles to be people of integrity we have to follow through whether or not we enjoy something so if you are at home i think it is important for you to make the effort to prepare pleasant dinners because i think thats part of the joy and comfort for your family put in the effort if your husband can eat frozen prepackaged mexican food with all those spices it means he has a pretty openminded stomach so you must be going far out of your way to mess with him i dont understand that hostility especially from a woman who has a oneyearold child the ability for you to maintain a safe and nurturing home for that child largely depends on the quality and existence of your marriage id expect you to make more of an effort most of the women who complain that they are not getting what they want from their husbands should stop and look at how disrespectful and disdainful they are of them they should also look at what they put their time and energy into at the expense of him and their marriage it would be a stunner for them to realize that they try harder to impress strangers than they try to impress the person who is supposed to be the most important to them as one listener gary says a husband is like a horse at the end of the day he is usually rode hard and put away sweaty like in the movies if his master drives and beats him hell go just so far before bucking and rebelling if you love him if you coax him hell drive himself till his heart explodes before he will let down his master hell give himself to death for the one he loves which way should women handle a man i have never gotten a complaint from a male listener in twentyfive years on the radio over my assertion that men are very simple creatures they agree i have explained time and again on my radio program that men are borne of women and spend the rest of their lives yearning for a womans acceptance and approval unless youve got a man with a frank mental or personality disorder the exception not the rule men admittedly are putty in the hands of a woman they love give him direct communication respect appreciation food and good lovin and hell do just about anything you wish foolish or not with one particular caller sandy i pushed this agenda through to a successful conclusion but not without a lot of sweat on my part and resistance on sandys part sandy my husband and i have a horrible relationship dr laura and why is that i wonder sandy he says im too headstrong but i think we are both too headstrong for each other dr laura he says you are too headstrong and what does that mean sandy he always tells me i like to take over situations that i like to control situations and that i go around him when we should discuss these things together i just go ahead and do it myself dr laura so why do you do that
