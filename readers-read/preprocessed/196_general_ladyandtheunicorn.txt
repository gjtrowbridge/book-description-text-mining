 nicolas des innocents the messenger said i was to come at once thats how jean le viste ishe expects everyone to do what he says immediately and i did i followed the messenger stopping just briefly to clean my brushes commissions from jean le viste can mean food on the table for weeks only the king says no to jean le viste and i am certainly no king on the other hand how many times have i rushed across the seine to the rue du four only to come back again with no commission its not that jean le viste is a fickle manon the contrary he is as sober and hard as his beloved louis xi once was humorless too i never jest with him its a relief to escape his house to the nearest tavern for a drink and a laugh and a grope to restore my spirits he knows what he wants but sometimes when i come to discuss yet another coat of arms to decorate the chimney or to paint on his wifes carriage door or to work into a bit of stained glass for the chapel people say the le viste arms are as common as horse dunghell stop suddenly shake his head and say with a frown this is not needed i should not be thinking about such commonplace matters go and i do feeling guilty as if i am to blame for bringing a carriages decoration to his attention when it was he who called for me id been to the rue du four house half a dozen times before it is not a place that impresses even with all the fields around it it is built as if it were in the middle of the city with the rooms long and narrow the walls too dark the stables too closethe house always smells of horses it is the sort of house a family that has bought its way into the court would live ingrand enough but poorly placed jean le viste probably thinks he has done well to be given such a place to live while the court laughs behind his back he should be living close to the king and notre dame not outside the city walls in the swampy fields around saintgermaindesprs when i arrived the steward took me not to jean le vistes private chamber a maplined room where he performs duties for court and king alongside family matters but to the grande salle where the le vistes receive visitors and entertain i had never been there it was a long room with a large hearth at the opposite end from the door and an oak table down the center apart from a stone coat of arms that hung on the chimney breast and another painted over the door it was unadornedthough the ceiling was paneled with handsome carved wood not so grand i thought as i looked around although shutters were open the fire hadnt been lit and the room was chilly with its bare walls wait here for my master the steward said glaring at me in this house people either respected artists or showed their contempt i turned my back on him and gazed out of a narrow window where there was a clear view of the towers of saintgermaindesprs some say jean le viste took this house so that his pious wife could step across to the church easily and often the door opened behind me and i turned prepared to bow it was only a servant girl who smirked as she caught me halfbent i straightened and watched as she moved across the room banging a pail against her leg she knelt and began to clear the fireplace of ashes was she the one i tried to rememberit had been dark that night behind the stables she was fatter than i recalled and sullen with her heavy brow but her face was sweet enough it was worth a word stay a moment i said when she had pulled herself up clumsily and made her way to the door sit and rest your feet ill tell you a story the girl stopped with a jolt you mean the story of the unicorn she was the one i opened my mouth to answer but the girl jumped in before me does the story go on to say that the woman grows big with child and may lose her place is that what happens so that was why she was fat i turned back to the window you should have taken more care i shouldnt have listened to you is what i should have done i should have shoved your tongue right up your arse out you go now theres a good girl here i dug into my pocket pulled out a few coins and threw them onto the table to help with the baby the girl stepped across the room and spat in my face by the time id wiped the spittle from my eyes she was gone so were the coins jean le viste came in soon after followed by lon le vieux most patrons use a merchant like lon to act as middleman haggling over terms drawing up the contract providing initial money and materials making sure the work gets done id already had dealings with the old merchant over coats of arms painted for a chimney breast an annunciation for the chamber of jean le vistes wife and some stained glass for the chapel in their chteau near lyons lon is much favored by the le vistes i have respect for him but i cannot like him he is from a family that were once jews he makes no secret of it but has used it to his advantage for jean le viste is also from a family much changed over time that is why he prefers lonthey are both outsiders who have made their way in of course lon is careful to attend mass two or three times a week at notre dame where many will see him just as jean le viste takes care to act the true noble commissioning works for his house entertaining lavishly bowing and scraping to his king lon was looking at me smiling through his beard as if he had spotted a monkey on my back i turned to jean le viste bonjour monseigneur you wished to see me i bowed so low my head throbbed it never hurt to bow low jean le vistes jaw is like a hatchet his eyes like knife blades they flicked around the room now then rested on the window over my shoulder i want to discuss a commission with you nicolas des innocents he said pulling at the sleeves of his robe which was trimmed with rabbit fur and dyed the deep red lawyers wear for this room i glanced around the room keeping my face clear of thoughts it was best to be so with jean le viste what did you have in mind monseigneur tapestries i noted the plural perhaps a set of your coat of arms to hang either side of the door jean le viste grimaced i wished i hadnt spoken i want tapestries to cover all of the walls all of them yes i looked around the room once again more carefully this time the grande salle was at least ten paces long and five wide its walls were very thick the local stone rough and gray three windows were cut into one of the long walls and the hearth took up half of one of the end walls tapestries to line the room could take a weaver several years what would you have as the subject monseigneur i had designed one tapestry for jean le vistea coat of arms of course it had been simple enough scaling up the coat of arms to tapestry size and designing a bit of background greenery around it jean le viste folded his arms over his chest last year i was made president of the cour des aides the position meant nothing to me but i knew what i should say yes monseigneur that is a great honor to you and your family lon rolled his eyes to the carved ceiling while jean le viste waved his hand as if he were ridding the room of smoke everything i said seemed to annoy him i want to celebrate the achievement with a set of tapestries ive been saving this room for a special occasion this time i waited of course it is essential that the family coat of arms be displayed of course monseigneur then jean le viste surprised me but not on its own there are already many examples of the coat of arms alone here as well as in the rest of the house he gestured at the arms over the door and hearth and to some carved in the ceiling beams that i hadnt noticed before no i want it to be part of a larger scene to reflect my place at the heart of the court a procession perhaps a battle a battle yes the battle of nancy i kept my face thoughtful i even smiled a little but in truth i knew little of battles and nothing of this one at nancy of who had been there who had been killed and who had won id seen paintings of battles but never done one myself horses i thought i would need to paint at least twenty horses to cover these walls tangled with mens arms and legs and armor i wondered then what had made jean le visteor lon more likelychoose me for this work my reputation at the court is as a miniaturist painter of tiny portraits of ladies that they give men to carry praised for their delicacy the miniatures are much in demand i paint shields and ladies carriage doors for drink money but my true skill is in making a face the size of my thumb using a few boar bristles and color mixed with egg white it needs a steady hand and that i have even after a long night of drinking at le coq dor but the thought of painting twenty huge horsesi began to sweat though the room was chilly you are sure that you want the battle of nancy monseigneur i said it was not quite a question jean le viste frowned why would i not be sure no reason monseigneur i answered quickly but they will be important works and you must be sure you have chosen what you want i cursed myself for my clumsy words jean le viste snorted i always know what i want i wonder at you thoughyou dont seem so keen on this work perhaps i should find another artist who is happier to do it i bowed low again oh no monseigneur of course i am most honored and grateful to be asked to design such a glorious work i am sure i am not worthy of your kindness in thinking of me you may have no fear that ill put my heart and blood into these tapestries jean le viste nodded as if such groveling were his due ill leave you here with lon to discuss details and to measure the walls he said as he turned to go i will expect to see preliminary drawings just before easterby maundy thursday with paintings by the ascension when we were alone lon le vieux chuckled what a fool you are with lon its best to come straight to the point and ignore his gibes my fee is ten livres tournois four now three when i finish the drawings and three when the paintings are done four livres parisis he responded quickly half when you finish the drawings the rest when you deliver the paintings and theyre to monseigneurs satisfaction absolutely not i cant work with no pay at the start and my terms are in livres tournois it was just like lon to try to confuse me by using paris livres lon shrugged his eyes merry we are in paris nestce pas shouldnt we use livres parisis that is what i prefer eight livres tournois with three now then three and two seven i will give you two tomorrow then two and three at the end i changed the subjectit is always best to let the merchant wait a little where will the tapestries be made north probably brussels they do the best work there north i shuddered i once had business in tournai and hated the flat light and suspicious people so much i vowed never to go north of paris again at least i wouldnt have to do more than paint designs and that i could do in paris once they were done i would have no more to do with the making of the tapestries so what do you know about the battle at nancy lon asked i shrugged what does it matter all battles are the same non thats like saying that all women are the same i smiled i repeatall battles are the same lon shook his head i pity your wife one day now tell me what will you have in your tapestries horses men in armor standards pikes swords shields blood what will louis xi be wearing armor of course perhaps a special plume in his helmet i dont know in truth but i know people who can tell me that sort of thing someone will carry the royal standard i expect i hope your friends are cleverer than you and will tell you that louis xi was not at the battle of nancy oh this was lon le vieuxs wayto make a fool of all around him excepting his patron you did not make a fool of jean le viste bon lon took out some papers from his pocket and laid them on the table ive already discussed the contents of the tapestries with monseigneur and done some measuring youll need to do them more precisely of course here he pointed to six rectangles he had roughly sketched theres space for two long ones here and here and four smaller here is the sequence of the battle he explained the battle carefully suggesting scenes for each of the tapestriesthe grouping of the two camps the initial strike two scenes of battle chaos then the death of charles the bold and the triumphant procession of the victors though i listened and made sketches of my own on the paper part of me stood apart and wondered at what i was agreeing to do there would be no women in these tapestries nothing miniature and delicate nothing that would be easy for me to paint i would earn my fee with sweat and long hours once youve made the paintings lon reminded me your work is done ill take them north to the weaver and his cartoonist will enlarge them to use for the weaving i should have been pleased that i wouldnt have to paint the horses large instead however i became protective of my work how do i know that this cartoonist is a proper artist i dont want him making a mess of my designs he wont change what jean le viste has decided ononly changes that will help the design and making of the tapestries you havent done many tapestries have you nicolas only a coat of arms i believe which i scaled up myselfi had no need of a cartoonist surely im capable of doing so on this commission these tapestries are a very different matter from a coat of arms they will need a proper cartoonist tiens theres one thing i forgot to mention youll need to be sure there are le viste coats of arms throughout the tapestries monseigneur will insist on that did monseigneur actually fight there lon laughed undoubtedly jean le viste was on the other side of france during the battle of nancy working for the king that doesnt matterjust put his coat of arms on flags and shields that others carry you may want to see some pictures of that battle and others go to grard the printer on the rue vieille du templehe has a book he can show you of engravings of the battle of nancy ill tell him to expect you now ill leave you to your measurements if you have problems come and see me and bring the drawings to me by palm sundayif i want changes youll need enough time to get them done before monseigneur sees them clearly lon le vieux was jean le vistes eyes i had to please him and if he liked what he saw jean le viste would too i couldnt resist a last question why did you choose me for this commission lon gathered his plain brown robe about himno fur trim for him i didnt if it were my choice i would have someone who has done more tapestries or go direct to the weaverthey have designs in hand and can work from those its cheaper and they are good at the designs lon was always frank why did jean le viste choose me then youll find out soon enough alors come to me tomorrow and ill have the papers for you to sign and the money i havent agreed to the terms yet oh i think you have there are some commissions an artist doesnt say no to this is one of them nicolas des innocents he gave me a look as he left he was right i had been talking as if i were going to do them still the terms were not bad in fact lon had not haggled very hard i wondered suddenly if his terms were still in paris livres after all i turned my eyes to the walls i was to dress so sumptuously two months to draw and paint twenty horses and their riders i stood at one end of the room and walked to the other counting twelve paces then walked across counting six paces pulling a chair to one wall i stood on it but even reaching as high as i could i was far from touching the ceiling i pulled the chair back and after hesitating a moment stepped up onto the oak table i reached up but was still at least my height again from the ceiling i was wondering where i could find a long pole to use for measuring when i heard humming behind me and turned around a girl stood in the entrance watching me a lovely girlshe had pale skin a high forehead a long nose hair the color of honey clear eyes id not seen such a girl before for a moment i couldnt say anything hello beauty i managed at last the girl laughed and hopped from one foot to the other she was wearing a simple blue dress with a tight bodice a square neck and narrow sleeves it was cut well and the wool was fine but it was not ornate she wore a plain scarf too her long hair falling almost to her waist compared to the servant who had cleaned the fireplace she was clearly too fine to be a maid perhaps a ladyinwaiting the mistress of the house wishes to see you she said then turned and ran away still laughing i didnt move ive learned from years of experience that dogs and falcons and ladies come back to you if you stay where you are i could hear her feet slap across the floor of the next room then stop after a moment the steps began again and she reappeared at the door are you coming she was still smiling i will beauty if you will walk with me and not hurry ahead as if i were a dragon you had to flee the girl laughed come she beckoned and this time i hopped down from the table i had to step quickly to keep up with her as she ran from room to room her skirt flapped as if she were blown along by a secret wind up close she smelled of something sweet and spicy underlined with sweat her mouth moved as if she were chewing something what do you have in your mouth beauty toothache the girl stuck out her tongueon its pink tip lay a clove the sight of her tongue made me hard i wanted to plow her ah that must hurt i will suck it better now why does your mistress want to see me the girl looked at me amused i expect shell tell you herself i slowed down why rush she wont mind will she if you and i have a little chat along the way what do you want to talk about the girl turned up a round staircase i leapt onto the stair in front of her to stop her from climbing what sorts of animals do you like animals i dont want you to think of me as a dragon id rather you thought of me as something else something you prefer the girl thought a parakeet perhaps i do like parakeets i have four they eat from my hand she ran around me to stand on the stairs above me she didnt go higher yes i thought ive set out my wares and shes coming for a look come closer my dear and see my plums squeeze them not a parakeet i said surely you dont think of me as a squawker and an imitator my parakeets make no noise but anyway you are an artist non isnt that what you doimitate life i make things more beautiful than they arethough there are some things my girl that cannot be improved upon with paint i stepped around her and stood three steps above i wanted to see if she would come to me she did her eyes remained clear and wide but her mouth was twisted into a knowing smile with her tongue she moved the clove from one cheek to the other i will have you i thought i will perhaps youre a fox instead she said your hair has a little red in among the brown i pouted how can you be so cruel do i look devious would i cheat a man do i run sideways and never straight rather im a dog who lays himself at his mistresss feet and is loyal to her forever dogs want too much attention the girl said and they jump up and muddy my skirts with their paws she stepped around me and did not stop this time comemy mistress waits we must not keep her i would have to hurryid wasted too much time on other animals i know which animal i want to be i panted running after her whats that a unicorn do you know of the unicorn the girl snorted shed reached the top of the stairs and was opening the door to another room i know it likes to lay its head in maidens laps is that what you like to do ah dont think of me so coarsely the unicorn does something far greater than that his horn has a special power you see did you know that the girl slowed down to look at me what does it do if a well is poisoned theres a well the girl stopped and pointed out of a window to the courtyard a younger girl was leaning over the edge of a well and looking down into it the sun bathing her hair in gold light jeanne always does that the girl said she likes to look at her reflection as we watched the girl spat into the well if your well there was poisoned beauty or sullied such as jeanne has just done a unicorn could come along and dip his horn into it and it would become pure again what do you think of that the girl moved the clove around with her tongue what do you want me to think of it i want you to think of me as your unicorn there are times when youre sullied yes even you beauty every woman is that is eves punishment but you can be made pure again every month if you will only let me tend to you plow you again and again until you laugh and cry every month you will go back to eden it was that last line that never failed when i was hunting a womanthe idea of that simple paradise seemed to snare them they always opened their legs to me in the hope that they would find it perhaps some of them did the girl laughed raucously this time she was ready i reached out to squeeze her and seal our exchange claude is that you whats taken you so long a door across from us had opened and a woman stood staring at us her arms folded across her chest i dropped my hand pardon maman here he is claude stepped back and gestured at me i bowed whats in your mouth the woman asked claude swallowed clove for my tooth you should be chewing mintthats much better for toothache yes maman claude laughed againprobably at the look on my face she turned and ran from the room banging the door behind her the room echoed with her steps i shuddered i had just tried to seduce jean le vistes daughter in the times id been to the house on the rue du four i had only ever seen the three le viste girls from afarrunning across the courtyard leaving on horses walking with a group of ladies to saintgermain desprs of course the girl by the well was one of them tooif id been paying attention i would have understood when i saw her hair and how she held herself that she and claude were sisters then i would have guessed who they were and never have told claude the story of the unicorn but i had not been thinking about who she wasid been thinking about how to bed her claude had only to repeat to her father what id said and i would be thrown out the commission taken from me and i would never see claude again i wanted her more than ever and not just for bedding i wanted to lie with her at my side and talk to her touch that mouth and hair and make her laugh i wondered where she had run to in the house i would never be allowed in therenot a paris artist with a noblemans daughter i stood very still thinking of these things perhaps i did so for a moment too long the woman in the doorway moved so that the rosary hanging at her waist clicked against the buttons on her sleeve and i stepped back from my thoughts she was looking at me as if shed guessed all that was going through my head she said nothing though but pushed the door open and went back in i followed i had painted miniatures in many ladies chambersthis one was not so different there was a bed made of chestnut and hung with curtains of blue and yellow silk there were oak chairs in a semicircle padded with embroidered cushions there was a side table covered with bottles and a casket for jewels and several chests for dresses an open window framed a view of saint germaindesprs gathered in the corner were her ladiesinwaiting working on embroidery they smiled at me as if they were one person rather than five and i chided myself for ever thinking claude could be one of them genevive de nanterrewife of jean le viste and mistress of the housesat down by the window she had clearly once been as beautiful as her daughter she was still a handsome woman with a wide forehead and a delicate chin but where claudes face was heartshaped hers had become triangular fifteen years as jean le vistes wife had straightened the curves set the jaw lined the brow her eyes were dark currants to claudes clear quinces in one way at least she outshone her daughter her dress was richercream and green brocade intricately patterned with flowers and leaves she wore fine jewels at her throat and her hair was braided with silk and pearls she would never be mistaken for a ladyinwaitingshe was clearly dressed to be attended to you have just been with my husband in the grande salle she said discussing tapestries yes madame i suppose he wants a battle yes madame the battle of nancy and what scenes will the tapestries display i am not sure madame monseigneur has only just told me of the tapestries i need to sit down and sketch before i can say for certain will there be men certainly madame horses yes blood pardon madame genevive de nanterre waved her hand this is a battle will there be blood flowing from wounds i expect so madame charles the bold will be killed of course have you ever been in a battle nicolas des innocents no madame i want you to think for a moment that you are a soldier but i am a miniaturist for the court madame i know that but for a moment you are a soldier who has fought in the battle of nancy you lost your arm in that battle you are sitting in the grande salle as a guest of my husband and myself beside you is your wife your pretty young wife who helps you with the little difficulties that arise from not having two handsbreaking bread buckling on your sword mounting your horse genevive de nanterre spoke rhythmically as if she were singing a lullaby i began to feel i was floating down a river with no idea where i was going is she a little mad i thought genevive de nanterre crossed her arms and turned her head to one side as you eat you look at the tapestries of the battle that has cost you your arm you recognize charles the bold being slaughtered your wife sees the blood spurting from his wounds everywhere you see le viste banners but where is jean le viste i tried to remember what lon had said monseigneur is at the kings side madame yes during the battle my husband and the king were snug at court in paris far from nancy now as this soldier how would you feel knowing that jean le viste was never at the battle of nancy yet seeing his banners everywhere in the tapestries i would think that monseigneur is an important man to be at the kings side madame his counsel is more important than his skills in battle ah that is very diplomatic of you nicolas you are far more of a diplomat than my husband but im afraid that is not the right answer i want you to think carefully and tell me in truth what such a soldier would think i knew now where the river of words i floated on was heading i didnt know what would happen once i moored he would be offended madame and his wife genevive de nanterre nodded yes there it is but thats no reason de plus i dont want my daughters to look at bloody carnage while entertaining at a feast youve met claudewould you want her to stare at some gash in a horses side or a man with his head cut off while shes eating no madame she shall not in their corner the ladiesinwaiting were smirking at me genevive de nanterre had led me to just where shed wanted she was cleverer than most of the noblewomen id painted because of that i found i wanted to please her that could be dangerous i cant go against monseigneurs wishes ma dame genevive de nanterre sat back in her chair tell me nicolasdo you know who chose you to design these tapestries no madame i did i stared at her why madame ive seen the miniatures you do of ladies in the court there is something about them that you capture which pleases me what is that madame their spiritual nature i bowed surprised thank you madame claude could do with more examples of that spiritual nature i try but she doesnt listen to her mother there was a pause i shifted from one foot to the other whatwhat would you have me paint instead of a battle madame genevive de nanterres eyes gleamed a unicorn i froze a lady and a unicorn she added she must have heard me with claude she must have heard me or she wouldnt have suggested it had she heard me seducing her daughter i tried to guess from her face she seemed pleased with herself mischievous even if she did know she could tell jean le viste about my attempt to seduce their daughterif claude hadnt done so alreadyand the commission would be lost not only thatwith a word genevive de nanterre could ruin my reputation at court and i would never paint another miniature i had no choice but to try to sweeten her are you fond of unicorns madame one of the ladiesinwaiting giggled genevive de nanterre frowned and the girl stopped ive never seen one so how would i know no its claude i am thinking of she likes them and it is she as the eldest child who will inherit the tapestries one day she may as well have something she likes id heard talk of the family sans heir of how it must rankle jean le viste not to have a son to pass on his beloved coat of arms to the blame for having three daughters must lie heavily upon his wife i looked at her a little more kindly what would you have the unicorn do madame genevive de nanterre waved a hand suggest to me what he might do he could be hunted monseigneur might like that she shook her head i dont want horses and blood and claude wouldnt be pleased if the unicorn were killed i couldnt risk suggesting the story of the unicorns magic horn i would have to repeat claudes idea the lady might seduce the unicorn each tapestry could be a scene of her in the woods tempting him with music and food and flowers and at the end he lays his head in her lap that is a popular story perhaps of course claude would like that she is a girl at the beginning of her life yes the virgin taming the unicorn might be the thing though it may pain me as much to sit among that as to be amidst a battle scene she said the last words almost to herself why madame i will be surrounded by seduction youth love what is all that to me she tried to sound dismissive of these things but she seemed wistful she doesnt share her husbands bed i thought she has had her daughters and has done her part not well eitherno sons now she is shut off from him and there is nothing left for her i was not in the habit of pitying noblewomen with their warm fires and full bellies and their ladies to attend them but at that moment i felt sorry for genevive de nanterre for i had a sudden vision of myself in ten years timeafter long journeys harsh winters illnessesalone in a cold bed limbs aching hands crabbed and unable to hold a paintbrush at the end of my own usefulness what would become of me death would be welcome then i wondered if she thought that she was looking at me with her sad clever eyes something in these tapestries will be hers i thought in a rush they will not only be about a seduction in a forest but about something else as well not just a virgin but a woman who would be a virgin again so that the tapestries are about the whole of a womans life its beginning and its end all of her choices all in one wound together that was what i would do i smiled at her a bell rang in the tower of saintgermaindesprs sext ma dame said one of the ladies i will go to that genevive de nanterre said weve missed the other offices and i cant go to vespers this eveningim expected at court with my lord she rose from her chair as another lady brought over the casket she reached up undid the clasp of her necklace and took it off allowing the jewels to lie glistening in her hands for a moment before they tumbled into the casket to be locked away her lady held out a cross dotted with pearls on a long chain and when genevive de nanterre nodded she slipped it over her mistresss head the other ladies began putting away their sewing and gathering their things i knew i would be dismissed pardon madame but will monseigneur agree to unicorns rather than battles genevive de nanterre was rearranging the corded belt at her waist while one of the ladies unpinned her dark red overskirt so that its folds fell to the floor and covered the green and white leaves and flowers you will have to convince him butsurely you should tell him yourself madame after all you were able to get him to agree to have me do the designs ah that was easyhe cares nothing about people one artist or another means little to him as long as they are accepted at court but the subject of the commission is between him and youi am meant to have nothing to do with it so it is best if he hears from you perhaps lon le vieux should speak to him genevive de nanterre snorted lon would not go against my husbands wishes he protects himself he is clever but not cunningand what is needed to convince jean is cunning i frowned at the floor the dazzle of the designs i would make had blinded me but now the difficulty of my place was sinking in i would prefer to design a lady and a unicorn over a battle with its many horses but i did not like to go against jean le vistes wishes either yet it seemed i had no choice id been caught in a web woven between jean le viste and his wife and daughter and i didnt know how to escape these tapestries will bring me to grief i thought i have a cunning idea madame the ladyinwaiting who spoke was the plainest but had lively eyes that moved back and forth as she thought in fact its a punning idea you know how monseigneur likes puns so he does genevive de nanterre agreed vist means speed the unicorn is vist nestce pas no animal runs faster so when we see a unicorn we think of viste batrice youre so cleverif your idea works with my husband you may marry this nicolas des innocents i will give you my blessing i jerked my head batrice laughed and all the women joined her i smiled politely i had no idea if genevive de nanterre was joking still laughing genevive de nanterre led her ladies out leaving me alone i stood still in the quiet room i should find a long pole and go back to the grande salle to begin measuring again but it was a pleasure to stay here with no ladies smirking at me i could think in this room i looked around there were two tapestries hanging on the walls with the annunciation i had painted for the room next to them i studied the tapestries these were of grape harvesters men cutting the vines while women stamped on the grapes skirts tucked high to reveal their spattered calves they were much bigger than the painting and with less depth the weave made them look rough and less fleshy and immediate than the virgin in my painting but they kept the room warm and filled more of it with their vivid reds and blues a whole room full of theseit would be like making a little world and one full of women rather than the horses and men of a battle i would much prefer that no matter how hard it would be to convince jean le viste i glanced out of the window genevive de nanterre and claude le viste were walking with their ladies toward the church their skirts blowing about them the sun was so bright that my eyes watered and i had to blink when i could see again they were gone replaced by the servant girl who carried my child she held a basket and was plodding in the other direction why did that ladyinwaiting laugh so hard at the thought of marrying me though i had not yet given much thought to marrying id assumed i would one day have a wife to look after me when i was old i had a good standing in the court steady commissions and now these tapestries to keep me and any wife there was no gray in my hair i had all but two of my teeth and i could plow thrice a night when the need arose it was true that i was an artist and not a squire or rich merchant but i wasnt a blacksmith or cobbler or farmer my hands were clean my nails trim why should she laugh so i decided first to finish measuring the room whatever i was to design for its walls i needed a pole and found the steward in the storerooms counting out candles he was as sour with me as before but directed me to the stables you watch out with that pole he ordered dont go doing any damage with it i smirked i didnt take you for a bawd i said the steward frowned thats not what i meant but im not surprised thats how you took it you who cant control your own rod what do you mean you know what i mean what you done to mariecleste marieclestethe name meant nothing when the steward saw my blank look he snarled the maid you got with child pisspot ah her she should have been more careful so should you shes a good girlshe deserves better than you its a pity about mariecleste but ive given her money and shell be all right now i must get that pole the steward grunted as i turned to go he muttered you watch your back pisspot i found a pole in the stables and was carrying it across the courtyard when jean le viste himself came striding out of the house he swept by without even looking at mehe must have thought i was just another servantand i called out monseigneur a moment please if i didnt say something now i might never get another chance alone with him jean le viste turned to see who was calling then grunted and kept walking i ran to catch up with him please monseigneur i would like to discuss the tapestries further you should talk to lon not me yes monseigneur but i felt that for something as important as these tapestries you should be consulted directly as i hurried after him the end of the pole dipped and caught on a stone tumbling from my hands and clattering to the ground the whole courtyard rang with the sound jean le viste stopped and glared at me i am concerned monseigneur i said hastily concerned that you should have hung on your walls what others would expect from such a prominent member of court from a president of the cour des aides no less i was making up words as i went along whats your point i am busy here i have seen designs for a number of tapestries this past year commissioned by noble families from my fellow artists all of these tapestries have one thing in commona millefleur background this much was truebackgrounds of a dense pattern of flowers were popular now particularly as weavers in the north perfected the technique flowers jean le viste repeated looking down at his feet as if he had just trampled upon some yes monseigneur there are no flowers in battles no monseigneur they have not been weaving battles several of my colleagues have designed scenes withwith unicorns in them monseigneur unicorns yes monseigneur jean le viste looked so sceptical that i quickly added another lie that i could only hope he wouldnt discover several noble families are having them madejean dalenon charles de st milion philippe de chartres i tried to name families jean le viste was unlikely to visitthey either lived too far away or were too noble for the le vistes or not noble enough they are not having battles made jean le viste repeated no monseigneur unicorns yes monseigneur they are la mode now and it did occur to me that a unicorn might be appropriate for your family i described batrices pun jean le viste didnt change expression but he nodded and that was enough do you know what to have this unicorn do yes monseigneur i do all right then tell lon and bring me the drawings before easter jean le viste turned to cross the courtyard i bowed to his back it hadnt been so hard to convince him as id thought i had been right that jean le viste would want what he thought everyone else had but then that is nobility without the generations of blood behind it they imitate rather than invent it didnt occur to jean le viste that he might gain more respect by commissioning battle tapestries when no one else had as sure of himself as he seemed he wouldnt strike out on his own as long as he didnt find out that there were no other unicorn tapestries i would be safe of course i would have to design the finest tapestries possible tapestries that would make other families want their own and make jean le viste proud to have been the first to own such a thing it wasnt just him i wanted to please though but his wife and daughter too i wasnt sure which mattered more to meclaudes lovely face or genevives sad one perhaps there was room for both in the unicorns wood that night i drank at le coq dor to celebrate the commission and afterward slept poorly i dreamt of unicorns and ladies surrounded by flowers a girl chewing on a clove another gazing at herself in a well a lady holding jewels by a small casket a girl feeding a falcon it was all in a jumble that i could not set straight it was not a nightmare though but a longing when i woke the next morning my head was clear and i was ready to make the dreams real
