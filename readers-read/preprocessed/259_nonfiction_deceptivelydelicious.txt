 changing habits through loving deception wouldnt it be great if kids came into the world with the innate desire to eat the right foods in reality however too many food choices8212many of them unhealthy8212make it impossible for kids to distinguish the good from the bad its up to us as parents to make choices for them at least until they are able to figure things out for themselves and its not realistic to simply disregard their food aversions either forcing your kids to eat foods they hate only reinforces their distaste thats where a little loving deception comes in handy deceptively delicious enables parents to give kids what they want and what they need at the same time it acknowledges your kids genuine dislikes without being confined by them it empowers you to exert some legitimate control over what your children eat without inviting the usual fights and most important its a way to give your kids a head start toward eating whats good for them so that theyll grow up and eat better food throughout their lives just as the most powerful lessons are the ones that arent taught the best parenting solutions are the ones that build good habits8212invisibly i want my kids to associate food and mealtimes with happiness and conversation not power struggles and strife with a little sleight of hand you can make the issue of what your children will and will not eat disappear from the table meet the kitchen cabinet jessica hi im jessica and this is my kitchen cabinet my allimportant staff of advisors my three children are my official recipe tasters they are my toughest critics if they approve i am confident that your tasters will too ive also tried these recipes out on their little friends and cousins who come by the house some of whom are difficult eaters as well sascha sascha our oldest is six years old and she is my toughest taster in fact she is practically impossible to please from birth it seems she has been decisively clear about what she will and wont eat she takes a hesitant and apprehensive approach to food and rarely will try anything new sweets are the exception however and she will try anything that even remotely looks like dessert julian julian our middle child is four years old hes a good eater if his older sister isnt around to influence him on his own hes happy to eat what is presented to him but when hes with sascha he falls prey to whatever she dictates so all of a sudden even when ive cooked food i know he likes hes pushing his plate away and saying i dont like it and now ive got not one but two kids who arent eating and with whom i would have spent the rest of the meal negotiating shepherd shepherd our baby is two years old and he is a remarkable eater he will eat anything anything he will eat himself sick the first word he spoke was that which was baby talk for i want that food there on your plate jerry my husband jerry is a great eater hes quite happy to eat vegetables and any healthy food i make for that matter in fact hell pretty much go along with whatevers happening which is one of the many things that make him such a great husband and hes a marvelous taster because unlike the kids hell say things other than ew gross this is disgusting
