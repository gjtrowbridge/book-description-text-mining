 chapter one there are sounds in tibet heard nowhere else in the world hollow moans inexplicably roll down the slopes of snowcapped peaks rumbles like thunder course through valleys under cloudless skies on moonlit nights in the mountain wilderness shan tao yun had heard tiny ringing tones floating down from the stars at first lying on his gulag prison bunk shan had felt fear at hearing such eerie sounds later he had decided they had to be the workings of the thin high altitude atmosphere and the wind of shifting ice formations and temperature changes between summits and valleys had concluded there were scientific explanations but after five years shan was no longer certain after so long in tibet he had abandoned most of his prior beliefs about the workings of the world certainly the wrenching sound that now rose across the bowl in the mountains could have no explanation in the physical world a young woman standing near shan groaned clapped her hands to her ears and ran away the first time he had heard the sound that came from the redrobed man sitting thirty feet away shan too had shuddered and wanted to flee throat chanting the monks called the strange grinding moan but shan preferred the description used by his old friend and former cellmate lokesh soul rattling lokesh called what surya the old monk was doing explaining that in the world below souls were often so undeveloped that the only time the sound was heard was in those near death as the soul struggled for release but in tibet no one spoke in fearful tones of the death rattle here the sound was for the living here the devout had learned to make souls speak without tongues shan watched the woman retreat with a pang of sorrow it was a day of great joy but one of even greater danger the outlaw monks shan lived with who for decades had remained hidden in their secret hermitage had decided not only to reveal themselves to the hill people but to lead the strangers in illegal rituals this would be a day of wonderful surprises gendun their senior lama had declared one of the days when the world was changed shan had warned the monks about the danger of bringing these particular tibetans to the ruined monastery gendun had replied by dropping onto one knee and turning over a pebble invoking a teaching the monks sometimes used the world could be changed by the subtlest of actions so long as it was pure and even the smallest of actions was pure so long as it was free of fear and anger but these herders had been conditioned by fear all their lives beijing had dealt harshly with the people of the rugged lands of southern lhadrung county who had stubbornly resisted the chinese occupation long after beijing8217s army had seized lhasa the ruins they now stood among were all that remained of zhoka gompa the monastery that for centuries had served the people living south of the county8217s central valley forty years earlier it had been attacked from the air by the people8217s liberation army one of the thousands of gompas annihilated by beijing the brave devout people who had futilely tried to defend zhoka and the way of life it represented had been dispersed destroyed or simply hollowed out 8220we8217ll be arrested8221 a woman in a tattered red vest had warned when shan and lokesh had met them on the grassy ridge above and motioned them to descend toward the halfmilewide tract of ruined buildings 8220it8217s haunted8221 another herder had protested as lokesh had stepped into the maze of crumbling stone walls 8220even the living become like ghosts here8221 but when lokesh kept walking singing an old pilgrim8217s song the man fell in behind his companions to enter the ruins they had followed in an uneasy silence until they had emerged in what had been the gompa8217s central courtyard 8220a miracle8221 the woman in the red vest had gasped as she clutched at an old woman beside her and gazed at the tenfoothigh shrine obviously newly constructed which stood in the center of the yard the two women advanced hesitantly watching surya who sat in front of the shrine they touched the brilliant white structure skeptical at first as if not believing their eyes then reverently sat before the monk others had slowly followed some touching strings of beads that hung from their belts but now as surya8217s throat chant began several of the hill people retreated toward the shadows those who remained seemed paralyzed by the sound staring wideeyed as surya joyfully threw his head back still chanting 8220godkiller8221 the shout came from nowhere and everywhere echoing off the ruined walls a stone flew past shan8217s shoulder and bounced off surya8217s knee 8220murderer8221 the same fearful voice cried the monk8217s chant faltered then stopped as he stared at the stone that had been aimed at him 8220godkiller8221 as the word was repeated shan spun about to see a short leatheryfaced man in the tattered clothes of a herder pointing at surya with rage in his eyes by the time the herder raised another stone shan was at his side clamping a hand around the man8217s wrist the man resisted twisting his hand pushing shan 8220flee for your lives the murderers8221 the herder cried out to the others who lingered in the yard a tall lean tibetan a stubble of white hair on his scalp and jaw appeared at the man8217s other side and the herder studying him uncertainly stopped moving lokesh pried open the herder8217s fingers letting fall the pebbles they held 8220surya is a monk8221 he said quietly 8220he is the opposite of a godkiller8221 8220no8221 the herder growled as surya8217s chant started anew it was not anger but despair that now filled the man8217s eyes 8220the government puts men in robes to trick us to get us to act out the old ways then they arrest us or worse8221 8220not here8221 lokesh said 8220not today8221 the man shook his head then as though to refute the old tibetan gestured into the shadows between the crumbling stone walls behind him a woman appeared her hands behind her gripping two corners of a rolled blanket two boys the oldest no more than ten walked behind her solemnly carrying the other end of the long burden inside the blanket their eyes gaunt and weary as the three reached the herder they lowered their heavy load the boys darting to the woman burying their heads in her heavy felt skirt the youngest releasing a long silent sob as lokesh knelt and slowly pulled back an edge of the blanket a hoarse groan escaped his throat it was an old man with a thin wispy beard his left ear hung loose where it had been nearly ripped away the left side of his face was caked with blood and sagging where his cheek and jawbones had been ravaged his lifeless eyes seemed to look up at the sky in question 8220they beat him to death8221 the herder declared in a low whisper still eyeing shan and lokesh warily 8220just beat him and left him like that8221 shan bent and pulled the blanket down both the man8217s legs appeared to be broken one turned at an unnatural angle the other bloody at a tear in his trousers that exposed a piece of bone 8220who would do such a thing8221 he asked looking at the empty brown eyes 8220his name was atso8221 the herder said 8220over eighty years old he lived alone in a hut at the base of a cliff two miles to the east toward the valley8221 the herder8217s eyes filled with pain and he paused for a moment as if struggling to control his emotions 8220of all the people in the hills he was the one who knew most about the old ways8221 8220someone killed him for following the old ways8221 shan asked the herder shrugged 8220they kill for a word in these hills8221 he said in a hollow matteroffact tone that sent a chill down shan8217s spine the man extracted a knife from his belt and with the blade pushed a twig of heather from atso8217s hair the tibetans were loath to touch the dead 8220the only way he would let strangers near him would be if one wore a robe8221 he said in an accusing tone casting a worried glance toward the woman and boys who moved toward the throat chanting 8220murderers are among us8221 he whispered
