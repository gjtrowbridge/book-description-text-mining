 chapter one steve isn8217t stupid he can tell by the way she keeps stealing glances at him by the way she follows everything he says with squeaky titters by the gradually shrinking perimeter of his personal space this afternoon that serena wants him he8217s known about her crush for months frequent visits to his office with no real purpose hemlines and necklines drifting inexorably toward each other projects stretching into evenings into weekends into fuzzy indeterminate hours that find the two of them alone with the soft rumble of the air conditioner and the laboring hiphop bass signature of her portable cd player serena is familiar with her product offering after all and she markets it well but steve isn8217t stupid he8217s withstood her voluptuous body and subtle signals because sleeping with his administrative assistant would be more trouble than it8217s worth because he8217s never cheated on a girlfriend in his life and if serena has figured this out by now8212tomorrow they8217ll be flying back to la after a full week in switzerland8212it hasn8217t stopped her from making a lastditch effort this afternoon which is remarkable considering that he spent his entire morning searching for an engagement ring up and down the sidewalks of the bahnhofstrasse beneath the overcast zurich sky weaving between men and women dressed in outfits that cost more than serena makes in a month around lunchtime he found a winner a stunning threecarat solitaire set on a thousandyearold band forged somewhere in the alps to the east a uniquely european item he purchased for just under thirty thousand swiss francs the ring is for his girlfriend janine she8217ll be waiting for him at lax in less than twentyfour hours one expectant face in a field of them beyond the post8211911 security checkpoint a smile and a kiss and a seventyfiveminute drive to valencia a dip into the jacuzzi tub with a sports illustrated and a few minutes later she8217ll bring him a limegarnished corona join him in the tub and he8217ll be waiting with the ring serena knows he plans to propose tomorrow evening she knows because it8217s all they8217ve been talking about since he met her at the train station and showed her the ring he even told her about lucerne a beautiful lakeside city here in switzerland where he plans to take janine for their honeymoon next summer and still serena casts smoldering glances at him brushes against his arm a little too often as they walk along the shadowy limmat river she takes his hand as they hurry across the rail tracks just beating an oncoming commuter train during a life spent pursuing women predicting their behavior well enough to have scored more often than most men steve still doesn8217t understand why women do what they do why is serena so attracted to a man eight years her senior a man with a serious girlfriend why is she more attracted as she listens to him talk about that girlfriend perhaps the exotic setting has something to do with it their visit to this ornate and historic european city the odd warble of police sirens the constant rush of intercity trains the ancient texture of cobblestone streets under their feet but it8217s more likely that serena8217s aggression is driven by the overpowering attraction a woman feels for something denied to her this isn8217t the first time he8217s met one who suffers from a fixation on unavailable men the two of them pass the train station and make their way toward the niederdorf a touristy sliver of zurich where claustrophobic streets have been closed to all but foot traffic and multilevel buildings advertise all manner of food and drink and sex serena keeps going on about her obsession with italian food so steve is directing them toward santa lucia a busy restaurant with a chef who is a master of masonryoven pizzas rain begins to splatter the cobblestone street as they push through the niederdorf crowds serena spots santa lucia and takes steve8217s hand compelling him to run with his other hand he pats the side of his overcoat reassuring himself with the slight and squarish bulk of the ring box and groans as he notices a clot of wet and hungry folks in the restaurant8217s entryway he could locate a cab in sixty seconds after all and find shelter in the warm dry bed of his hotel room thirty minutes after that instead he watches as serena wriggles her way inside leaving steve and an elderly germanic man to brave the rain fifteen minutes later they8217re seated in a dark corner of the restaurant steve is thoroughly soaked 8220i hope this food is as good as you say8221 serena says 8220i8217m starving8221 she chatters on while they wait to order and steve strug gles to guide her away from the deeper waters of intimate conversation he reveals the imminent acquisition of a new product database he asks her opinion about moving the us web servers to zurich serena responds by asking whether he prefers merlot or chianti but before he can answer she grabs a passing waiter and orders something that doesn8217t sound like either one 8220janine is going to be so surprised8221 she says turning back to him 8220i mean really three carats she is so lucky8221 8220well it wasn8217t the size of the stone i was after so much i was just looking for something unique8221 8220i know silly but you have to understand girls rings are very important to us engagement rings i mean8221 steve smiles politely he8217s not sure what else to say 8220let me see it8221 serena says 8220now8221 8220come on just a peek8221 steve retrieves the box and places it on the table he tries not to notice how dark it is in this corner of the restaurant how candlelight twinkles in serena8217s face as she opens the box and removes the ring he wishes janine were here he wishes she were sitting across the table from him twirling the ring between her fingers smiling he wants to reach out and snatch the ring back he wants to wipe that dreamy smile right off serena8217s fleshy face instead she presses the ring against her left hand 8220do you mind8221 steve glares at her startled 8220it probably won8217t fit8221 she says 8220but i just want to see what it feels like may i8221 he looks again at the ring the stone is nearly pure in its color and clarity a supernova in the candlelight 8220actually8221 he says 8220i8217d like to put it back now8221 serena8217s smile withers 8220right don8217t want to tarnish the precious ring with my cooties8221 8220serena it makes me nervous to have it out i paid a lot of money for that thing8221 8220money money money is that all you ever think about steve8221 predictable as they are serena8217s mood swings constantly amaze him8212from sunny skies to tornado warning in an instant8212but such volatility has its place and he8217d guess were he interested in such a thing that she probably makes love like a monster probably screams and moans and shouts obscenities that curl paint but he can8217t be interested in such a thing because tomorrow he8217ll be in la with his soontobe fianc233e and any guilt steve incurs here will undoubtedly follow him all the way home it will taint the first sight of janine8217s smiling face and forever color his memory of the proposal serena might even tumble off her precarious ledge of good judgment and fall into the fatal attraction abyss 8220are you going to answer me8221 she asks him her eyebrows are arched perfectly above heavy liner and green irises red lipstick over straight white teeth her pink tongue dancing8212 8220i8217m sorry what did you say8221 8220jesus steve are you so lovesick that you can8217t even listen when i ask you a question8221 8220i8217m sorry i8217m really tired what did you say8221 she slides the ring box across the table 8220it doesn8217t matter8221 the waiter arrives with their entr233es and serena plows immediately into her spaghetti washing down every other mouthful with a swallow of wine steve8217s pizza dante blisters the roof of his mouth before he finishes the first bite their entire bottle vanishes in minutes and serena orders another as she uses her fork to chase the last orphaned bits of spaghetti around her plate 8220what8217s the matter8221 he asks when the waiter takes away their empty plates 8220nothing8221 8220come on serena you haven8217t said a word in ten minutes8221 8220i stopped talking because you weren8217t listening8221 8220i said i was sorry8221 steve says 8220answer my question then is money the only thing you ever think about8221 8220of course not money is just a means to an end8221 8220what end8221 the waiter appears again and steve requests the bill 8220why are you asking for the check8221 8220so we can pay did you want to stay here all night8221 8220jesus steve do you ever have any fun8221 8220what kind of question is that8221 8220i paid this much bring the check now it8217s inefficient to remain in the restaurant any longer than necessary they don8217t bring the check steve because they expect you to sit here and have a conversation that8217s what people do over here they don8217t rush home from the restaurant to watch american idol8221 8220we can have a conversation in the cab ride back to the hilton8221 8220cab ride i thought we were having a drink after dinner8221 8220we have a ten o8217clock flight tomorrow morning we have to be at the airport three hours early8221 serena stands 8220fine we better get plenty of sleep now wouldn8217t want to doze off during the thirteenhour plane ride to la8221 steve tries to say something apologize but she8217s already heading for the door he drops two hundred francs on the table and takes off after her in the entryway he is confronted with an array of black overcoats all seemingly identical to his own and by the time he finds the right one serena is long gone it8217s dark now and the crowds have dwindled to a few umbrellatoting stragglers steve has no umbrella he turns right and walks in the direction of the nearest road hoping to find a cab quickly wet cobblestones glisten beneath his feet rain pours from his hair in tickling streams someone grabs him he turns quickly ready to strike but it8217s serena she has stepped out from a narrow opening between two buildings and mascara streaks her face like black ink she pulls him into the alleyway her brown hair is now jet black and draped over her shoulder like thick rope 8220are you happy steve8221 she asks breath humid with garlic and red wine 8220what are you talking about8221 8220it8217s a simple question honey are you happy because you don8217t seem like it8221 she8217s holding him by his upper arms her face floats mere inches from his 8220i8217m fine but i think you need some rest8221 8220i don8217t want you to be fine i want you to be happy ever since i met you8212it8217s been two years now do you realize that8212you8217ve been so serious so driven you think you8217ve got this plan that you8217ve got

this8221 she says kissing him with her mouth wide open steve is ready to push her away immediately but the combination of her lipstick and the wine and the garlic is so human so organic that for a split second he enjoys the moment finally enjoys it then he pushes her away 8220steve82128221 8220no stay away from me8221 a percussion of rain envelops them the nearby buildings seem to shrink even closer footsteps of passersby grow louder then fainter she stands there chest heaving her overcoat wet and clinging he can8217t help but notice the swell of her generous breasts 8220you wanted me8221 she whispers 8220i could feel it8221 steve steps out of the alley and she follows him 8220no i didn8217t8221 8220why can8217t you just live steve live enjoy yourself all i want is to see you happy8221 8220then leave me alone that would make me happy8221 she blinks once 8220you8217re an asshole8221 she says 8220i8217m going to be engaged tomorrow what kind of person would i be if i betrayed janine
