 he had been awake all night thinking he had gone without rest or nourishment he did not need them he had to devise his plan that was the only thing that mattered at dawn he had once again summoned the council of twelve telepathically the session had been brief he had simply informed them that the matter was in hand that the project could not fail and that he would soon put it into execution the council members had not dared to ask him what his plans were they had complete faith in him after all he was their superior he had ordered them to return at noon for a meeting of the utmost importance now it was time to deal once more with those incompetents so hungry for wealth and power he briskly straightened his long purple robe embroidered with gold thread and strode off to the council chamber when he opened the door with his usual abruptness the room fell silent as each councilor felt paralyzed by fear not one was bold enough to look him directly in the eye the terrified council of twelve watched him the thirteenth councilor whose existence beyond those walls was a mystery to all and who imposed his will on everyone his image was not reflected in any mirror he cast no shadow he was not human 1 jade the old man read the passage in the prophecy once more and nodded solemnly soon very soon he muttered rising with difficulty from his chair he turned to face the duke of divulyon who was waiting anxiously before him well asked the duke the old man sighed deeply he seemed exhausted his face was etched with countless wrinkles his back was bent and he could barely stand on his trembling legs collapsing into an armchair he said weakly i cannot change a thing she will follow her destiny thodon you are a wise man said the duke his voice rising in obvious distress you have devoted your entire life to understanding the prophecy you helped my father you have helped me you have advised me supported me do not abandon me now she must live she must triumph whatever happens she is so young to think that soon what can i do to protect her thodon holding his head in his hands the old man remained silent for a long time i love her as much as you do he replied at last i watched her grow up and even though it goes against my better judgment i have become fond of her but she will not escape the prophecy believe me if i could have helped her i would have been the first to do so you ask me how she can be protected you cannot protect her try to understand that all you have to do is give her what is rightfully hers when the day comes now go go and spend the few moments you have left with her fourteen years have passed much too quickly murmured the duke in weary resignation then he left the room the old man stared at the flames blazing in the hearth the prophecy would be fulfilled now it was only a matter of days he had waited for this moment had longed for it impatiently soon all his questions would be answered he shivered it was foolish of him to have become attached to the child he shouldnt have done that the prophecy had taken on another meaning in those obscure pages where he had tried so hard to read the future and to understand the upheaval that was to come he no longer saw anything except the fate of a girl named jade that same girl was lying sprawled across her bed she was feeling much too restless to read the book in her hands and there was a faraway look in her eyes roused from her reverie by a sudden knock at the door she leaped to her feet calling come in a servant opened the door a crack and said your father wishes to speak to you will you receive him now surprised that her father was not busy at that hour jade gave her consent and the servant retired jade smoothed down her long black hair then tossed it over her shoulders she looked in the mirror and approved of what she saw true her smile revealed teeth with slight gaps between them her eyelashes were perhaps a bit too thick and she was constantly brushing back a few rebellious stray locks whenever she became irritated which happened often her cheeks grew red and she lost the selfconscious expression she usually wore however she knew she was tall slender and beautiful and she always dressed with care she was sure of herself she knew that whatever she wanted she could get while she was smiling knowingly at her reflection her father entered the room she went to him and he hugged her with unusual affection although he loved his daughter he did not normally show his feelings so openly reserved by nature he was always cool and composed and yet that day something was making him behave differently releasing jade from his embrace he studied her for a moment without speaking once again he admired the striking intensity of her green eyes she is brave and tenacious he reflected trying to reassure himself and she has a strong character her features betrayed that character you could see in her face that she was proud and determined but capricious and stubborn as well lost in thought her father could not stop gazing at her it was jade who broke the silence papa is something the matter dont you have any important business to attend to why arent you reading stacks of documents or dealing with thousands of tasks as you do every other day is something serious keeping you from your work is it my fault this last question was asked with feigned innocence and her father answered with a forced smile no no jade nothings wrong ive just got a bit of free time thats all i know it doesnt happen very often but as you can see it does happen so how are you not long now till the party she replied eagerly its going to be absolutely fantastic i still cant decide between the mauve silk dress or the white satin one i ordered a third dress a splendid one from the county of tyrel if it arrives in time i shall wear that one i simply cant wait instead of counting the days i count the hours even the minutes ive given instructions about how the banquet hall should be decorated and what food and music we should have oh its such fun to be organizing everything myself and ive arranged for musicians to come from a nearby town she kept on chattering enthusiastically but her father was no longer listening shes too thoughtless he admitted to himself reluctantly she has never encountered difficulties she knows nothing of danger she wont be able to survive he reproached himself immediately for not having more confidence in jade and tried to concentrate on what she was saying its going to be magnificent superb spectacular i can hardly wait i still havent decided whether the ices should be served before the macaroons or afterward perhaps after would be better dont you think by the way im not sure if the baroness of carolynt will be coming it seems she has a fever shes the only guest who hasnt accepted yet anyway i find her boring jade do you know what fear means startled into silence jade was annoyed why had her father interrupted her especially to ask a question that was quite beside the point wasnt he looking forward to the party fear she replied crossly fear of what ive never been afraid its a hateful feeling only cowards and weaklings are frightened why do you ask me that papa just then jade realized how pale her father was how could she have failed to notice how tired he looked with those dark circles under his reddened eyes and above all that haggard expression something had happened perhaps his business affairs had not been going well if only cowards and weaklings feel fear then i am cowardly and weak said the duke in any case it doesnt matter but papa youre respected and admired by everyone and for good reason you are the duke of divulyon jades face lit up again her green eyes flashing i would believe you if you said you were worried about matters of state but you frightened no if this is a joke its not very funny the duke did not reply jades spirits fell again and now papa she said gravely tell me why you dont think my birthday is at all important in a few days i shall be fourteen years old you are quite mistaken jade i am very concerned about your birthday but the duke bit his tongue he had already said too much she was not to know anything before it was time afraid that he might betray secrets he was not free to explain he turned on his heel and left going upstairs to his private suite where he began to pace back and forth every second was bringing him closer to the moment when he would have to reveal everything puzzled jade wondered briefly about her fathers exceedingly strange behavior then shrugged her shoulders and decided not to fret about it her thoughts returned to the festivities planned for her birthday and a smile returned to her lips
