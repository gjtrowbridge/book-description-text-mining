 chapter one ok dont panic everythings going to be fine of course it is of course it is quotif you could lift up your top mrs brandonquot the sonographer has a pleasant professional air as she looks down at me quoti need to apply some jelly to your abdomen before we start the scanquot quotabsolutelyquot i say without moving a muscle quotthe thing is im just a teeny bit nervousquot im lying on a bed at the chelsea and westminster hospital tense with anticipation any minute now luke and i will see our baby on the screen for the first time since it was just a teeny blob i still cant quite believe it in fact i still havent quite got over the fact that im pregnant in nineteen weeks time i becky brandon n233e bloomwood am going to be a mother a mother lukes my husband by the way weve been married for just over a year and this is a one hundred percent genuine honeymoon baby we traveled loads on our honeymoon but ive pretty much worked out that we conceived it when we were staying in this gorgeous resort in sri lanka called unawatuna all orchids and bamboo trees and beautiful views unawatuna brandon miss unawatuna orchid bambootree brandon hmm im not sure what mum would say quotmy wife had a slight accident in the early stages of pregnancyquot luke explains from his seat beside the bed quotso shes a little anxiousquot he squeezes my hand supportively and i squeeze back in my pregnancy book nine months of your life it says you should include your partner in all aspects of your pregnancy otherwise he can feel hurt and alienated so im including luke as much as i possibly can like last night i included him in watching my new dvd toned arms in pregnancy he suddenly remembered in the middle that he had to make a business call and missed quite a lotbut the point is he doesnt feel shut out quotyou had an accidentquot the sonographer pauses in her tapping at the computer quoti fell off this mountain when i was looking for my longlost sister in a stormquot i explain quoti didnt know i was pregnant at the time and i think maybe i bashed the babyquot quoti seequot the sonographer looks at me kindly she has graying brown hair tied back in a knot with a pencil stuck into it quotwell babies are resilient little things lets just have a look shall wequot here it is the moment ive been obsessing over for weeks gingerly i lift up my top and look down at my swelling stomach quotif you could just push all your necklaces asidequot she adds quotthats quite a collection you have therequot quottheyre special pendantsquot i loop them together with a jangle quotthis one is an aztec maternity symbol and this is a gestation crystal and this is a chiming ball to soothe the baby and this is a birthing stonequot quota birthing stonequot quotyou press it on a special spot on your palm and it takes away the pain of laborquot i explain quotits been used since ancient maori timesquot quotmmhmmquot the sonographer raises an eyebrow and squeezes some transparent gloop on my stomach frowning slightly she applies the ultrasound probe thing to my skin and instantly a fuzzy blackandwhite image appears on the screen i cant breathe thats our baby inside me i dart a look at luke and hes gazing at the screen transfixed quotthere are the four chambers of the heart quot the sonographer is moving the probe around quotnow were looking at the shoulders quot she points to the screen and i squint obediently even though to be honest i cant see any shoulders only blurry curves quottheres an arm one hand quot her voice trails off and she frowns theres silence in the little room i feel a sudden grip of fear thats why shes frowning the babys only got one hand i knew it a wave of overpowering love and protectiveness rises up inside me tears are welling in my eyes i dont care if our babys only got one hand ill love it just as much ill love it more luke and i will take it anywhere in the world for the best treatment and well fund research and if anyone even dares give my baby a look quotand the other hand quot the sonographers voice interrupts my thoughts quotother handquot i look up choked quotits got two handsquot quotwell yesquot the sonographer seems taken aback at my reaction quotlook you can see them herequot she points at the image and to my amazement i can just about make out the little bony fingers ten of them quotim sorryquot i gulp wiping my eyes with a tissue she hands me quotits just such a reliefquot quoteverything seems absolutely fine as far as i can tellquot she says reassuringly quotand dont worry its normal to be emotional in pregnancy all those hormones swilling aboutquot honestly people keep talking about hormones like luke last night when i cried over that tv ad with the puppy im not hormonal im perfectly normal it was just a very sad ad quothere you goquot the sonographer taps at her keyboard again a row of blackandwhite scan pictures curls out of the printer which she hands to me i peer at the first oneand you can see the distinct outline of a head its got a little nose and a mouth and everything quotso ive done all the checksquot she swivels round on her chair quotall i need to know now is whether you want to know the gender of the babyquot quotno thank youquot luke answers with a smile quotweve talked it through at great length havent we becky and we both feel it would spoil the magic to find outquot quotvery wellquot the sonographer smiles back quotif thats what youve decided i wont say anythingquot she quotwont say anythingquot that means shes already seen what the sex is she could just tell us right now quotwe hadnt actually decided had wequot i say quotnot for definitequot quotwell yes we had beckyquot luke seems taken aback quotdont you remember we talked about it for a whole evening and agreed we wanted it to be a surprisequot quotoh right yesquot i cant take my eyes off the blurry print of the baby quotbut we could have our surprise now it would be just as magicalquot ok maybe thats not exactly true but isnt he desperate to know quotis that really what you wantquot as i look up i can see a streak of disappointment in lukes face quotto find out nowquot quotwell quot i hesitate quotnot if you dont want toquot the last thing i want is to upset luke hes been so sweet and loving to me since ive been pregnant recently ive had cravings for all sorts of odd combinationslike the other day i had this sudden weird desire for pineapple and a pink cardigan and luke drove me to the shops especially to get them hes about to say something when his mobile phone starts ringing he whips it out of his pocket and the sonographer puts up a hand quotim sorry but you cant use that in herequot quotrightquot luke frowns as he sees the caller display quotits iain id better call him backquot i dont need to ask which iain itll be iain wheeler the chief marketing honcho of the arcodas group luke has his own pr company brandon communications and arcodas is lukes big new client it was a real coup when he won them and its given a fantastic boost to the companyhes already hired more staff and is planning to open loads of new european offices on the back of it so its all wonderful for brandon communications but as usual lukes working himself into the ground ive never seen him so at anyones beck and call before if iain wheeler calls he always always calls him back within five minutes whether hes in another meeting or hes having supper or even if its the middle of the night he says its the service industry and arcodas is his megaclient and thats what theyre paying for all i can say is if iain wheeler calls while im in labor then that phone is going straight out the window quotis there a land line i can use nearbyquot luke is asking the sonographer quotbecky you dont mind quot quotits finequot i wave a hand quotill show youquot the sonographer says getting up quotill be back in a moment mrs brandonquot the two of them disappear out the door which closes with a heavy clunk im alone the computer is still on the ultrasound probe thing is resting next to the monitor i could just reach over and no dont be silly i dont even know how to use an ultrasound and besides it would spoil the magical surprise if luke wants us to wait then well wait i shift on the couch and examine my nails i can wait for things of course i can i can easily oh god no i cant not till december and its all right there in front of me and nobodys about ill just have a teeny peek just really quickly and i wont tell luke well still have the magical surprise at the birthexcept it wont be quite so much of a surprise for me exactly leaning right over i manage to grab the ultrasound stick i apply it to the gel on my stomachand at once the blurry image reappears on the screen i did it now i just have to shift it slightly to get the crucial bit frowning with concentration i move the probe around on my abdomen tilting it this way and that craning my neck to see the screen this is a lot easier than i thought maybe i should become a sonographer im obviously a bit of a natural theres the head wow its huge and that bit must be my hand freezes and i catch my breath ive just spotted it ive seen the sex of our baby its a boy the image isnt quite as good as the sonographersbut even so its unmistakable luke and i are going to have a son quothelloquot i say aloud to the screen my voice cracking slightly quothello little boyquot and now i cant stop the tears rolling down my cheeks were having a gorgeous baby boy i can dress him up in cute overalls and buy him a pedal car and luke can play cricket with him and we can call him oh my god what are we going to call him i wonder if luke would go for birkin then i could get a birkin to be his nappy bag birkin brandon thats quite cool quothi little babyquot i croon gently to the big round head on the screen quotdo you want to be called birkinquot quotwhat are you doing quot the sonographers voice makes me jump shes standing at the door with luke looking appalled quotthats hospital equipment you shouldnt be touching itquot quotim sorryquot i say wiping my eyes quotbut i just had to have another quick look luke im talking to our baby its just amazingquot quotlet me seequot lukes eyes light up and he hurries across the room followed by the sonographer quotwherequot i dont care if luke sees its a boy and the surprise is ruined i have to share this precious moment with him quotlook theres the headquot i point quothello darlingquot quotwheres its facequot luke sounds a bit perturbed quotdunno round the other sidequot i give a little wave quotits mummy and daddy here and we love you veryquot quotmrs brandonquot the sonographer cuts me off quotyoure talking to your bladderquot well how was i supposed to know it was my bladder it looked just like a baby as we walk into the consultant obstetricians room im still feeling rather hot about the cheeks the sonographer gave me this huge great lecture about how i could have done damage to myself or broken the machine and we only managed to get away after luke promised a big donation to the scanner appeal and she said since i hadnt been anywhere near the baby it was very unlikely id seen the sex hmph but as i sit down opposite dr braine our obstetrician i feel myself start to cheer up hes such a reassuring man dr braine hes in his sixties with graying wellgroomed hair and a pinstripe suit and a faint aroma of oldfashioned aftershave and hes delivered thousands of babies including luke to be honest i cant really imagine lukes mother elinor giving birth but i guess it must have happened somehow and as soon as we discovered i was pregnant luke said we had to find out if dr braine was still practicing because he was the best in the country quotdear boyquot he shakes lukes hand warmly quothow are youquot quotvery well indeedquot luke sits down beside me quotand hows davidquot luke went to school with dr braines son and always asks after him when we meet theres silence as dr braine considers the question this is the only thing i find a tad annoying about him he mulls over everything you say as though its of the greatest importance whereas you were actually just making some random remark to keep the conversation going at our last appointment i asked where he had bought his tie and he thought about it for five minutes then phoned his wife to check and it was all a total saga and i didnt even like the stupid tie quotdavids very wellquot he says at last nodding quothe sends his regardsquot theres another pause as he peruses the sheet from the sonographer quotvery goodquot he says eventually quoteverythings in order how are you feeling rebeccaquot quotoh im finequot i say quothappy that the babys all rightquot quotyoure still working fulltime i seequot dr braine glances at my form quotand thats not too demanding for youquot beside me luke gives a muffled snort hes so rude quotits quot i try to think how to put it quotmy jobs not that demandingquot quotbecky works for the lookquot explains luke quotyou know the new department store on oxford streetquot quotaahquot dr braines face drops quoti see quot every time i tell people what i do they look away in embarrassment or change the subject or pretend theyve never heard of the look which is impossible because all the newspapers have been talking about it for weeks yesterday the daily world called it the quotbiggest retail disaster in british historyquot the only plus about working for a failure of a shop is that it means i can take as much time off as i like for doctors appointments and prenatal classes and if i dont hurry back no one even notices 8220i8217m sure things will turn around soon8221 he says encouragingly 8220now did you have any other questions8221 i take a deep breath 8220actually i did have one question dr braine8221 i hesitate 8220now that the scan results are ok would you say it8217s safe to you know 8221 8220absolutely8221 dr braine nods understandingly 8220a lot of couples abstain from intercourse in early pregnancy8221 8220i didn8217t mean sex8221 i say in surprise 8220i meant shopping8221
