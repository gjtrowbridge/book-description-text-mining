 i hate press conferences but i especially hate them when ive been ordered to hide large portions of the truth the order had come from the queen of air and darkness ruler of the dark court of faerie the unseelie are not a power to be crossed even if i was their very own faerie princess i was queen andaiss niece but the family connection had never bought me much i smiled at the nearly solid wall of reporters fighting to keep my thoughts from showing on my face the queen had never allowed this much of the human media inside the unseelies hollow hill our sithen it was our refuge and you dont let the press into your refuge but yesterdays assassination attempt had made allowing the press into our home the lesser evil the theory was that inside the sithen our magic would protect me much better than it had in the airport yesterday where id nearly been shot our court publicist madeline phelps pointed to the first reporter and the questions began princess meredith you had blood on your face yesterday but today the only sign of injury is your arm in a sling what were your injuries yesterday my left arm was in a green cloth sling that matched my suit jacket near perfectly i was dressed in christmas yule red and green cheerful and it was that time of year my hair was a deeper red than my blouse my hair is the most unseelie part of me sidhe scarlet hair for someone who looks good in black not the gold or orangey red of human hair the jacket brought out the green in two out of the three circles of color in my iris the gold circle would flash in the camera light sometimes as if it truly was metallic the eyes were pure seelie sidhe the only part of me that showed that my mother had been of the golden court well at least half i didnt recognize the reporter who had asked the question he was a new face to me maybe new since yesterday since yesterdays assassination attempt had happened in front of the media on camera well wed had to turn away some of the reporters because the big room wouldnt hold more id been doing press conferences since i was a child this was the biggest one id had including the one after my father was assassinated id been taught to use names for reporters when i knew them but to this one i could only smile and say my arm is only sprained i was very lucky yesterday actually my arm hadnt been injured in the assassination attempt that got on film no my arm had been hurt on the second or was that the third attempt on my life yesterday but those attempts had happened inside the sithen where i was supposed to be safe the only reason the queen and my bodyguards thought i was safer here than outside in the human world was that we had arrested or killed the traitors behind the attempts on me and the attempt on the queen wed damned near had a palace coup yesterday and the media didnt have a hint of it one of the old names for the fey is the hidden people weve earned the name princess meredith was it your blood on your face yesterday a woman this time and i did know her name no i said i smiled for real as i watched her face fall when she realized she might be getting just a oneword answer no sheila it wasnt mine she smiled at me all blond and taller than i would ever be may i add to my question princess now now madeline said one question per its okay madeline i said our publicist turned to look at me flipping off the switch at her waist so her microphone would not pick up i took the cue and covered mine with my hand and moved to one side of it madeline leaned in over the table her skirt was long enough that she was in no danger of flashing the reporters down below the dais her skirt was the absolute latest hem length of the moment as was the color part of her job was paying attention to what was in and what was out she was our human representative much more than any ambassador that washington had ever sent if sheila gets to add to her question then they will all do it that will make everything harder for you and for me she was right but tell them that this is an exception then move on she raised perfectly plucked eyebrows at me then said okay she hit the switch on her mike as she turned and smiled at them the princess will let sheila ask another question but after that youll have to keep it to the original rule one question per she pointed to sheila and gave a nod thank you for letting me add on to my question princess meredith youre welcome if it wasnt your blood yesterday then whose was it my guard frosts the cameras flashed to life so that i was blinded but the attention of everyone had moved behind me my guards were lined up along the wall spilling down the edges of the dais to curl on either side of the table and floor they were dressed in everything from designer suits to fullplate body armor to goth club wear the only thing that all the outfits had in common was weaponry yesterday wed tried to be discreet about the weapons a bulge that ruined the line of the jacket but nothing overt today there were guns under jackets or cloaks but there were also guns in plain sight and swords and knives and axes and shields wed also more than doubled the number of guards around me i glanced back at frost the queen had ordered me not to play favorites among the guard shed gone so far as to tell me not to give any long lingering glances to one guard over another id thought it was an odd demand but she was queen and you argued with her at your peril but i glanced back after all hed saved my life didnt that earn him a glance i could always justify it to the queen my aunt that the press would think it strange if i hadnt acknowledged him it was the truth but i looked because i wanted to look his hair was the silver of christmastree tinsel shiny and metallic it fell to his ankles like decoration but i knew that it was soft and alive and felt oh so warm across my body hed put the upper layer of his hair back from his face with a barrette carved from bone the hair glittered and moved around his charcoalgrey armani suit that had been tailored over his broad shoulders and the athletic cut of the rest of him the suit had also been tailored to hide a gun in a shoulder holster and a knife or two it had not been designed to hide a gun under each arm or a short sword at his hip with a leather scabbard strapped tight to his thigh the hilt of a second sword rode over his shoulder peeking through all that shining hair he bristled with knives and frost always had other weapons that you couldnt see no suit was designed to cover that much armament and hold its shape his jacket couldnt be buttoned at all and the guns and sword and one knife glinted in the cameras flash cries of frost frost filled the room while madeline picked a question the man was another one i didnt know nothing like an assassination attempt to attract the media frost how badly were you hurt frost is a little over six feet and since i was sitting down and the microphone was adjusted to my height he had to lean down way down with a weapon of any kind he was graceful but bending low over that mike he was awkward i had a moment to wonder if hed ever been on mike before then his deep voice was answering the question i am not hurt he stood back up and i could see the relief on his face he turned away from the cameras as if he thought hed get off that easily i knew better but wasnt it your blood on the princess his hand was gripping the pommel of his short sword touching his weapons unnecessarily was a sign of nerves he leaned over the mike again and this time he bumped my bad shoulder with his body i doubted the press saw such a small movement but it was too clumsy for words for frost he braced a hand flat against the table steadying himself he turned eyes the grey of a winter sky to me the look asked silently did i hurt you i mouthed no he let out a sigh and leaned back to the microphone yes it was my blood he actually stood back up as if that would satisfy them he should have known better he had been decorative muscle for the queen at enough of these over the years to know that he was being a little too concise at least he didnt try to go back to his spot behind me this time a reporter i did know simon mccracken was next hed covered the faerie courts for years frost if you are not hurt then where did your blood come from and how did it get on the princess he knew how to word the question just right so we couldnt tapdance around it the sidhe dont lie well paint the truth red purple and green and convince you that black is white but we wont actually lie frost leaned over the mike again his hand pressed to the table hed moved minutely closer to me close enough that his pants leg touched my skirt his sword was almost trapped between our bodies that would be bad if he had to draw the weapon i looked at his hand so big and strong on the table and realized his fingertips were mottled he was gripping the table the way you grip a podium when youre nervous i was shot he had to clear his throat sharply to continue i turned my head just enough to see that perfect profile and realized it was more than nerves frost the queens killing frost was afraid afraid of public speaking oh my i have healed my blood covered the princess when i shielded her from harm he started to stand back up but i touched his arm i covered the mike with my hand and leaned in against him so i could whisper against the curve of his ear i took in a deep breath of the scent of his skin and said kneel or sit his breath went out so deep that his shoulders moved with it but he knelt on one knee beside me i moved the microphone a little closer to him i slid my hand under the back of his jacket so that i could lay my hand against the curve of his back just below the side sweep of the big sword sheath when fey are nervous any fey we take comfort from touching one another even the mighty sidhe feel better with a little contact though not all of us will admit it for fear of blurring the line between royalty and commoner i had too much lesser fey blood in my veins to worry about it i could feel the sweat that was beginning to trickle down his spine madeline started to come closer to us i shook my head she gave me a questioning look but didnt argue she picked another question from the throng so you took a bullet to protect princess meredith i leaned into the mike putting my face very close to frosts touching carefully so i didnt get makeup on him the cameras exploded in bursts of white light frost jumped and i knew that was going to be visible to the cameras oh well we were blinded vision blurred in bursts of white and blue spots his muscles tightened but i wouldnt have known it if i hadnt been touching him hi sarah and yes he took a bullet for me i said i think sarah said hi princess back but i couldnt be sure since i still couldnt see well enough and the noise of so many voices was too confusing id learned to use names when i knew them it made everyone feel more friendly and you need all the friendly you can get at a press conference frost were you afraid he relaxed minutely against me into the touch of my hand and my face yes he said afraid to die someone yelled out without being called on frost answered the question anyway no madeline called on someone who asked then what were you afraid of i was afraid meredith would be harmed he licked his lips and tensed again i realized hed used my name without my title a faux pas for a bodyguard but of course he was more than that every guard was technically in the running to be prince to my princess but we were sidhe and we dont marry until were pregnant a nonfertile couple is not allowed to wed so the guards were doing more than just guardingmy body frost would you give your life for the princess he answered without hesitation of course his tone said clearly that that had been a silly question a reporter in back who had a television camera next to him asked the next question frost how did you heal a gunshot wound in less than twentyfour hours frost gave another deep shouldermoving sigh i am a warrior of the sidhe the reporters waited for him to add more but i knew he wouldnt to frost the fact that he was sidhe was all the answer he needed it had been only a through and through bullet wound from a handgun and no special ammunition it would take a great deal more than that to stop a warrior of the sidhe i hid my smile and started to lean into the mike to help explain that to the press when the sweat along his spine suddenly stopped being wet and warm it was as if a line of cold air swept down his back cold enough that i moved my hand away startled i glanced down at his big hand on the table and saw what id feared a white rime of frost was drifting out from his hand
