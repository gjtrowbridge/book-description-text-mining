 id gone out of my way to avoid thinking of amir sexually from the moment i met him eight months before in early june of 2002 it was at a party and i was reeling from my reentry to american life after my first trip to afghanistan normally i love parties but that night i found the effort to make small talk exhausting i told the host that i was leaving although it was barely midnight wait you should meet amir hes from afghanistan meet ann she just got back from mazarisharif last week a powerfully built man with thick black hair a hooked nose and skin the same olive tone as mine was leaning against the kitchen counter that doubled as the bar he looked to be in his late thirties maybe older his clothes couldnt have been more ordinary a blue striped brooks brothers shirt and blue blazer over chinos there was something a little rumpled about him that reminded me of the prep school boys at harvard who wore the same white shirt and blazer theyd had to wear in boarding school but with a defiant dshabill you were to know theyd gone to an elite school but had become too cool for all that that effect would have been completed with a battered pair of topsiders but this man had light tan loafers of cheaplooking leather immigrant shoes livinginqueens shoes amirs slouch though was challenging even arrogant in a familiar american way it was nothing like the body language of the men id met in afghanistan a couple of weeks before they had confounded my expectations of stereotypical mountain warriors proverbial fierce afghans they were quieter and gentler than americans their voices softer their way of holding themselves dignified but never aggressive from the start i responded to amir differently than i would have to a western man id taken the warnings of my friends with more experience in afghanistan to heart no body language that could be construed as flirtation and never offer more physical contact than shaking a mans hand on greeting and leavetaking so i said hello to amir stiffly in dari shma khub asteed amir broke into a smile lots of americans had been going to afghanistan latelyit was all too fashionablebut few bothered to learn afghan persian or dari judging my abilities correctlyid only been studying for a monthhe answered in english im fine how are you there might have been a note of mild parody in his reply i laughed and he continued what were you doing in mazar a friend of mine is friends with general dostum from the early nineties after the taliban fell he wanted to go back and he took me and another american woman with him dostum is a controversial figure the unelected ruler of a good chunk of northern afghanistan american newspapers call him a warlord but his forces were key in defeating the shytaliban and he supports womens education and voting rights amirs warm brown eyes narrowed he should be tried as a war criminal he said i remembered my dinners at dostums table and how his obsidian eyes had gradually opened as he grew comfortable with my presence one night i watched as an afghan woman argued fiercely with him and was amazed at his patience i would never have been the guest of a politician i thought was a war criminal though i knew that dostum like the late ahmed shah massoud bore some responsibility for the destruction of kabul in the early nineties thats ridiculous no politicians hands in afghanistan are clean but and i argued with amir soon i heard myself getting too heated afghanistan was not my country and it was amirs i am known for not backing down from a disagreement but this time i decided to avoid a fullon confrontation i told amir i had to leave and then i did something else i rarely did with a man i asked for amirs card i did it because i wasnt attracted to him because my interest was purely in the afghan connection or so i would have said anything or anyone having to do with afghanistan was fascinating to me in the full flush of my infatuation with the country i read the name of the consulting firm on the card i know your firm i worked at your main competition twenty years ago what a hell job that had been do you like it im an engineer maybe that explained the shoes they have me doing pretty specialized assignments its fine i dont have to travel that much are you still in consulting im a writer ive published a book and i write book reviews pieces on politics i did a new york post oped about my trip but i make my living in business im a headhunter for tax and pension lawyersits an odd little niche listen id like to talk more but im still jetlagged it was nice to meet you amir the next day i carefully entered amirs information in my computer so i could get in touch with him before my next trip to afghanistan i didnt like his politics but even so i had fun talking with him maybe it was that ive never met an afghan who spoke such good english or seemed so westernized even the returned afghan american exiles id met in afghanistan had more rough edgesendearing rough edges to be sure but qualities in their speech and dress and manner that made me think theyd be out of place in my social life no matter how aristocratic their families were in afghanistan in america they registered as immigranty four months later in october i arranged to go back to afghanshyistan for four weekes this time i was going to teach english at the university and buy supplies for some of the pitiful primary schools i visited the first time around i also wanted to broaden my exposure beyond dostums circle and region so i emailed amir and invited him to talk about afghanistan over coffee i promised not to become too vehement his response was eager and friendlymaybe hed forgotten our spat something made me suggest that he come to my house for a coffee but i picked a day when my housekeeper would be there from my experience in afghanistan i figured that amir might be uncomfortable being alone with a woman or assume that i meant to seshyduce him i dressed conservatively and didnt offer him shyalcohol sitting on my livingroom couch and sipping the water hed asked for amir told me about himself his family were wellconnected pashtun landowners from the mixed pashtun and tajik area near herat that made amir the first pashtun id met the region id visited around mazar was largely uzbek in the news coverage of the war against the taliban i was taken with the beauty of the bearded pashtun tribesmen but i also absorbed some of the liberal aamerican prejudice against this ethnic group whod provided the power base for the taliban they had a reputation as socially conservative headstrong and warlike they were towelheads who toted guns and oppressed their women yet amir had gone to princeton i learned and seemed the soul of reason anger crept into his voice only when he talked about how hed been trying to return to afghanistan ever since the fall of the taliban i keep waiting and waiting for my green card id like to go for a long trip maybe ill work for the government they can use americantrained engineers i havent been back since we fled to pakistan in 1982 when i was fourteen so youre thirtyfour i tried to keep the surprise from my voice he looked years older and i liked that he had some character to his face at my age i was unable to see anything but generic youth in many thirtyfouryearold faces yeah im old to be an associate i went to grad school for a year in houston then i started a company with one of my cousins there but it didnt go very well dotcom i thought i was going to be a millionaire but we got caught in the dotcom bust after that i took the first good job i was offered in new york and moved to brooklyn i was lucky to get hired before 911 i looked at the clock and realized i had to leave for a friends reading somehow an hour and a half had gone by and wed never even talked politics wed have to do something about that but when amir returned a few days later this time without the housekeeper present we never got to politics in fact after he left i couldnt remember much of what we talked about at allonly a sense of pleasure
