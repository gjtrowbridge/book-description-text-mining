 chapter one the intervention it was one of those utterances that sparkled the very daring could you see us canoe shrugged to be expected after all canoe was our local recovering it was she who left those pamphlets in the clubhouse next to the mens nineteenth hole still the very daring intervention canoe cracked her knuckles lit a cigarette we sat by her swimming pool absentmindedly pulling weeds from around the flagstones the ice of our iced tea had already melted into water and it was too cold to swim besides its obvious canoe said blowing hes going to kill himself in less than a month i dont want that blood on my hands who would he was someone we loved someone we could not help but love a colleague of our exhusbands a past encounter we had known him since before we were we from our first weeks in this town early summers we loved his hair golden the color of that movie actors hair the famous one sometimes we caught just the gleam of it through the windshield of his bmw as he drove by sporty waving green metallic leather interior some sort of monogram on the wheel youve seen the license plate sold a realtor but never desperate yes he sold our mimi klondikes tudor on twelve oaks lane with full knowledge of her rotting foundation but desperate no just thirsty intervention barbara repeated canoe flexed her toes as if she had invented the word this a late summer day a fallish day ricardo the pool boy swept maple leaves from the pool water in this light a dull sickly yellow we watched him we couldnt take our eyes off canoe interrupted actually i shouldnt be the one explaining theres someone from the group whos our expert pips phelp actually pips phelp the lawyer pips phelp we spoke in whispers who knew who lived in trees besides he might drive up any minute he often did youd hear the crunch of his tires on the gravel see the flash of blond hair behind the windshield these times youd dry your hands on your shirtfront check your face in the toaster you wouldnt want to be caught what alone you let him in hed ask you to he would stand at your door behind your screen wondering if he could of course youd say though you looked a mess if you were unlucky the dishwasher ran one of the louder cycles if you were lucky all was still the house in magical order spotless clean he surveyed this was his job you never knew he told you when he might be needed you shivered him a handsome man a man with the habit of standing close his smell animal rooty your hands after gardening his straight teeth were white though he didnt smile that way his was a better smile toothless brief as if he understood he had caught you with more than a wet shirtfront you obliged the suspicion you were always guilty of something still you showed him what you had done were attempting recent renovations whatnot a fabric swatch laid on the back of your couch a roll of discount wallpaper for the powder room shells of some sort youd been trying youd explain to fix the place up but things had gotten behind the contractors attentions divided et cetera et cetera he nodded or did not his was a serious business assessing value worth ricardo the pool boy served sandwiches we had spent a few days per canoes instruction contemplating the responsibility of our action the absolute commitment the difficulty the discipline the sacrifice esther curran now sat among us someone had invited her she was speaking of how he had shown her a cape near grendale knoll after walters death when she had believed she couldnt bear it the house the reminders and how she esther was no longer a beautiful woman here esther peeled the crust off her sandwich and looked away we sat around her in canoes wroughtiron it was too cold to lounge the weather had suddenly turned and the reason we sat around the pool at all was beyond us unless it had something to do with ricardo we watched him receding toward the pool house then turned back to esther this was the point esther was saying though we may have lost it he had taken her hand he had stroked it he had told her of the possibilities there wasnt much to be done the demolition of the florida room a few shingles rehung refurbishing the kitchen think of it he had told her we watched esther with looks on our faces we had never understood her rich as croesus she drove a dodge and compared prices at the safeway her husband walter had died years ago but she still referred to him as if he had run downtown for milk and would be back any minute she allowed her hair to gray her nails to go ragged true she had always been our eccentric an artist she kept chameleons in her living room draperies and would often arrive at parties with paint on her hands but more than once in recent years we understood she had been escorted in the early hours of the morning found wandering in robe and slippers on the old route 32 luckily rarely traveled for she could have been struck down as easily as a stray dog now here she was among us intervention she said is not a word of which i am particularly fond esther cut her crustless sandwich into nine even squares walter and i are of the liveandletlive philosophy she continued but in certain unavoidable circumstances such as the one we confront here today i say yes i say intervene she picked up a square and we waited thinking esther might have more to add but she simply smiled and popped it whole into her mouth frankly canoe said this to pips phelp who had convened the meeting and sat at the edge of us in a deck chair i dont want to hear about him wrapped around a telephone pole i wouldnt be able to live with myself pips phelp nodded we knew him from the club one of a number of men who zipped by in a cart heading elsewhere gloved hand guiding the wheel he seemed to have little to say too quiet for an interventionist though canoe insisted he was skilled in these matters and we had read in the literature that we needed him a leader a discussion initiator understood he said we agreed to meet the next day in the safeway parking lot for a runthrough pips phelp would play his part did we understand fully pips had explained that this would be tantamount to ambush there would be little time he said he will fight you he will want to flee he will deny your accusations you will have to talk quickly under absolutely no circumstance can you allow him to leave the vehicle we had decided that this would be the place wed find him when it is over one of you will get behind the wheel and drive him to the center you will check him in it has been arranged pips phelp now sat in his buick the motor running we saw him clearly though we pretended not to this was part of the plan we pulled in in vivs suburban and got out one at a time no one saying a word canoe gave a short whistle and we circled the buick feeling the rush of the boardingschool escapade what were we doing was anyone watching pips phelp pretended not to notice he was a poor substitute for him truth be told he sat there in a guthold against the wheel his fingers strumming he smelled of gum or mints of pretzels of efforts to stave off tobacco we knew him as a weak man we knew him as a man who could be trusted his wife eleanor carried the look of the perpetually bored his children were overachievers you can only guess at the goodcheer stickers on the bumper of his buick he was a hedge trimmer a leaf raker a modelboat builder he was a man who never thought of selling every spring along the borders of the driveway to his house a ranch just past the ko cemetery he planted red and pink impatiens pips this from canoe acting surprised our signal to converge pips looked up turned off the engine canoe he said our signal to open his doors canoe had already slid in the passenger side yanked the keys from the ignition our hearts beat too loud drumlike we were not used to intervening what is this pips said whats everybody doing here his talent was not for acting he sounded like a commercial you might see on latenight television were here because we love you canoe said were here because we care about your life we flushed who wouldnt we didnt care for pipss life we wanted him we wanted his smooth leather shoes his argyle socks his blue cashmere doublebreasted coat we wanted his promise of future appreciation what are you talking about pips said shifting around to look at those of us in the backseat some couldnt fit and leaned on the windows whats the big idea we laughed we couldnt help it please pips viv said to clue him in hed never say big idea pips gave us a look and turned back toward the windshield he composed himself a man of infinite patience then shifted around again whats the meaning of this he said the meaning said viv is concern you are a sick person its not your fault you cant help yourself its genetic you need help were here to help you some of us bit our fingernails pips laughed like bela lugosi sick me what do you mean by these unfounded accusations ive never felt better i think youre sick i think you are all suffering from a serious mental health problem this was going all wrong no one sounded like a real person what were trying to say said judy sawyer but she didnt know what then came a long and awkward pause canoe sighed audibly come on ladies she said weve gotten off on the wrong foot then she opened the passenger side and got out signaling for us to do the same we did as pips phelp waited pretending once again that he had just driven up know that we are a closeknit community weve lived here for years which is not to say that our ancestors are buried here simply this is the place we have all ended up we were married in 1953 divorced in 1976 our grown daughters pity us our grown sons forget us we have grandchildren we visit from time to time but their manners agitate so we return nervous thankful to view them at a distance most of us excel at racquet sports it is not in our makeup to intervene this goes against the grain is entirely out of our character we allow for differences but strive not to show them ours are calm waters smooth sailing yes some among us visit therapists but quite frankly we believe this is a passing phase like our former passion for fondue or our semester learning decoupage weve seen a lot weve seen the murdersuicide of the clifford jacksons tate kieley jailed for embezzlement dorothy schoenbacher in nothing but a mink coat in august dive from the roof of the cookes inn weve seen dick morehead arrested in the ladies dressing room at lord taylor attempting to squeeze into a petite teddy weve seen francis stoney gone mad brenda nelson take to cocaine weve seen the blackballing of the stewart collisters weve seen more than our share of liars and cheats thieves drunks we couldnt count still hes someone we love and in truth we love few early the morning after our practice run we met again at the safeway canoe brought a thermos of coffee and we stood drinking from our styrofoam cups in the early cold as if at a tailgate it did seem a game the weather football weather changeable ominous geese honking overhead flying elsewhere a strong wind set loose shopping carts in random directions as if they were being pushed by the ghosts of shoppers past coupon offers and flyers of various sorts blew about as well canoe suggested coffee cake but we declined we were on the whole nervous we enjoyed our weekly stocking up at the safeway we kept lists but to linger in its parking lot felt just shy of delinquency and a long way from canoes swimming pool and ricardos languid strokes when we finally spotted pips phelps buick turning in our spirits had undeniably flagged pips didnt seem to notice ladies he said slamming the door getting out top of the morning was this man always working from some sort of script why the long faces he said theyll get over it canoe said she dropped her styrofoam cup to the asphalt and crushed it twisting her flat as if to stub out a cigarette butt we watched riveted you do not need to tell us we were stalling canoe got into her jeep and rolled down the window understand she told him theyre not used to unpleasantness we have seen a lot its true but know so little how were we to learn years ago we were led down the primrose lane then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond suffice it to say there is little nourishment here and the carp have grown strange cancers when we look in their pond we see them beneath our own watery faces but think of the consequence his disappearance we piled in as instructed we buckled our safety belts we turned to pips phelp who stood in salute and waved canoe gunned the jeep hiho silver she said and we were off the plan to find him come hell or high water to drive to the limits of our town to cover his turf we watched pips phelp trail us in his buick his flaccid pink face in the rearview we werent nice we made fun we said how ordinary was pips how completely known we said how he could flatten pips phelp with one fist kaboom barbara shouted and she meant it kaboom kaboom she raised her fist and punched the air why the anger mimi klondike asked as if intervention were catching barbara shrugged felt like it she said esther we noticed didnt speak she wasnt often of late among us and now she might as well not have been she sat in the back of the jeep staring out the window some kind of smock we wouldnt be caught dead in spread over her legs she had letters in her pockets to people we had never met her hair seemed unwashed esther mimi klondike said why the long face barbara smirked but esther simply turned toward us she might have been smiling or this might have been her natural expression beyond her our country changing maples stone walls gravel drives newly washed automobiles children horses dogs passed but we were looking at esther i was thinking how strange she finally said i was thinking how strange to be alive then she turned away we drove in silence what else was there to do time passed and we thought our thoughts we thought of him how he held a flashlight to our souls our basements how he checked for dry rot carpenter ants the carcasses of flying insects in the darkness we saw him searching and we yelled down do you need a hand bingo canoe shouted she slammed the jeep brake bingo bango we leaned in looking what we said him yes there pinned to louise coopers chemicled lawn the sign sold realtors freshly hammered into the ground beside it his bmw forest green buffed as his nails stood idle in louises drive arriving or leaving impossible to say henry cooper on early retirement had recently dropped dead putting the eighteenth green we knew louise had thoughts of moving to captiva still we felt the jealousy of his transferred affections louise we thought her keep calm canoe shouted veering in our hands were in our laps our feet pushed against the carpeted floor braking mimi and barbara ducked on impulse the rest of us sat stockstill we knew the plan pips phelp would stay behind at a distance there if needed ready to follow in his car to the center to do the necessary paperwork to check him in the approvals had been given the gears were in motion canoe parked the jeep jerked the emergency brake this a stroke of luck really we might have found him nowhere we might have been too late now here we were sitting and listening to the ticking engine watching the steam rise off the hood the day seemed warmer the gray breaking into blue the sun a sudden glare it shone off the chrome of his bmw flashed in our eyes as if a badge he held up for protection was he there did we see him canoe got out she slammed the front door and sauntered over she strode canoe the toughest among us we kept quiet we waited for the signal two coughs followed by a hand clap this would mean he was in the vehicle and we should proceed as rehearsed mimi still ducking rolled down her window so we could hear better but what we heard was an ordinary day a dog barking crickets a siren at the far edge of town in it canoes boots crunched gravel canoe knocked it should be said that in recent months he had acquired a new bmw the latest model understand him as a leaser in his profession the importance of the vehicle is not to be underestimated every year he trades up still the license plate remains sold the color forest green this one however has been slightly altered the windows blackened as if a rebuke to our constant attentions but he cannot escape us we know his comings and goings his ring size we know at the stone barn he orders manhattan clam chowder a cup and a grilled cheese for lunch we know his difficulty with languages his general insecurity in all things pertaining to math we know as a boy he watched the mayor hide the golden easter egg then blatantly pretended to find it we know he dreams of killing we know he scratches himself in ugly places and picks his nose that his breath is rank in the morning and he scissors black hairs from his ears and plucks his eyebrows we know this and more his bad back his quenchless thirst he is our faithless husband our poor father he is our bad son our schemer our rogue he is our coward in the conflict our liar he has betrayed all he has promised still we love him must be in the house canoe shouts back to us come on we go we fan out our hearts taut drums our feet heavy canoe crouches ahead then rounds the bend breaking away from the culdesac we run after her and line up on either side barbara at the far end mimi the near we cross our arms over our chests and wait canoe tries the front door its open she pushes through it is louise coopers house but it may as well be our own the powder room off the foyer louises monogrammed hand towels theres ivory soap in the shape of shells dirtied from her gardeners hands theres a chandelier thats dusty unused unpaid bills on the secretary a needlepoint giraffe weighted with sand holds the den door open here wed find louises real life her tv guides her tarnished tennis trophies framed photographs of her children with outdated hairstyles but were not going there we pause instead in the empty foyer what are we listening for what do we want and then we hear him he is speaking in a low voice a whisper it is a sound wed recognize anywhere the sound of him prospecting a cold call like the slap of waves in our ocean like a salt cure he wants something he is asking to all of us he has spoken in such a manner kissed our fingers he has guided us through our living rooms his hand on the small of our backs shhhhh canoe says as if someone has spoken but no one has said a word we simply stand at the bottom of louise coopers staircase like bridesmaids waiting to catch the bouquet but we are not bridesmaids we are women near the end of our lives we look up at nothing the hallway the bedroom doors still his voice is everywhere which room which direction canoe climbs we follow at the top of the stairs we pause waiting nothing no sound at all but something just below the surface quiet what something so familiar a woman weeping our louise we walk down the hallway pushing at doors there are so many empty bedrooms this one simply light from the nowblue sky shining through its open windows onto the poplin spread pulled taut pillows fluffed as if louise is expecting guests the next one the same we move quickly we hurry we push on doors we open closets we do not find her until the maids room she sits on a narrow cot among little artifacts a wirecage mannequin a yellowpainted dresser a childrens mirror on the floor there is no rug if we were barefoot we would be splintered but we are not we are shoed and zipped buttoned and covered this we notice because louise is not she is without a stitch of clothing entirely nude she covers herself when we burst in drawing her legs up and arms around to cinch them she is a ball of flesh louise cooper leaking from the eyes she does not need to ask to know our mission she points weakly in the direction of a narrow staircase the back way esther takes the lead and we hurry pellmell reckless we sense there is little time and so we tumble down the stairs our flats nicking the soft wood our hands slapping cold walls released near the back door into the open the sudden fresh air the sudden light we run we tear we might spread our arms fly we head out so fast our flats flapped off some way back seven pair abandoned like fourteen blackbirds in a jagged line our soft soles hopscotching gravel rock then the grassy stubble in the field behind the coopers esther ripping the justred stalks from their roots barbara and mimi holding hands running viv and judy behind canoe in the lead we must find him we know we must intervene we do not want him wrapped around a telephone pole we do not want that blood on our hands we must save him mustnt we we must save him quick but first no first we must save ourselves
