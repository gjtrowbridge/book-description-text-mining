 8220we8217re going to have to stand and fight they8217re right on top of us8221 horrocks said he gorged the thrusters with power looted from the ship8217s secondary demands his wife toggled through the viewscreens the perimeter cameras tracked pursuit ships as they weaved through the background 8220there8217s at least twenty8221 she said 8220closer to thirty two dead aft8221 8220what about the spot drive8221 horrocks said 8220it8217s still cold from the last jump8221 8220put your belt on8221 horrocks said 8220i hate wearing the belt8221 8220sari put the fucking belt on8221 horrocks said sari reached up to the head of her chair and pulled down the yshaped harness horrocks was already wearing his the ship lurched upward briefly then shot backward as horrocks switched to the rear thrusters sari8217s hair flew forward and she cried out the moondrunk rattled as the twin ships directly behind her broke over her back silver and black debris tumbled past the forward viewscreen 8220my stomach8221 sari said horrocks brought the ship up in a tight arc trying to flee the cadre of aggressors the moondrunk rattled again 8220that wasn8217t debris we just hit8221 horrocks said 8220we were rammed check the screens come on sari check the screens where are they8221 the moondrunk snapped to a halt that nearly dislocated both command chairs from their floor sockets 8220they8217ve got hold of us8221 horrocks said the ship was being forced down horrocks applied more pressure to the forward thrusters but couldn8217t arrest the moondrunk 8217s descent two more tethers punctured the moondrunk 8217s hull 8220must be hooked to a winch8221 horrocks said he locked the thrusters on high reached down to his seat and unlocked the harness 8220get into the bunker take the dogs8221 8220i can8217t move my arms i can8217t get out of the chair8221 sari said horrocks leaned over to unstrap her 8220you8217re wasting fuel8221 she said 8220should have let me fly we8217re still going down may as well turn it off8221 horrocks nodded sari shut the engine the moondrunk descended quickly and collided with the other ship horrocks fell across his wife her shoulder hit him in the cheek 8220sorry8221 horrocks said and stood up straight he helped sari to her feet and guided her down the hallway outside the cockpit 8220is it the bastards8221 she asked 8220i8217m sure it is get into the bunker and stay there8221 they both stopped when they heard the magnetic umbilical latch onto their ship the light above the exit hatch shone green the locks on the outer door were easily tripped two large men stepped inside a third stayed on the lip of the umbilical he aimed a rifle at horrocks 8220tinton wants to see you8221 the man said he swiveled the rifle and aimed it at sari the two large intruders lifted their hands to show they were unarmed as they moved toward horrocks and sari sari spat in the face of the nearest one he slugged her in the arm and she fell back against the wall horrocks sprang forward the man removed a steel rod from his pocket and struck horrocks across the face horrocks staggered but managed to get in front of his wife the intruder wiped sari8217s spittle from his nose and lashed out at horrocks again horrocks grabbed the arm and cracked it over his knee 8220my elbow8221 he said and doubled over horrocks lifted the arm like a crank and threw the goon into his partner the man with the rifle stepped through the portal onto the moondrunk 8220i hate coming all the way through8221 he said and pointed his rifle at sari again 8220sweetheart8221 he said then to one of the goons 8220this ain8217t no peepshow loome help your brother up and get these two married cretins under control8221 8220calder my arm8221 8220do something and you8221 calder said to horrocks 8220you8217ll let them that8217s how this works because if it doesn8217t work i8217ll be forced to use my new gun and i8217d rather not then i8217ll be forced to fly your ship so do what i say8221 calder was in his midthirties his beard was as thin as the hair on his crown he had two black plums for nostrils 8220are you a bastard too8221 horrocks asked 8220not the king8217s8221 calder said he licked the corner of his mouth and motioned toward the door with his gun 8220don8217t want to keep tinton waiting8221 the uninjured goon shoved horrocks and sari forward the other one was propped against a wall eyes closed his bad arm held against his stomach like a jumble of frail twigs horrocks noticed that the men were wearing oversized miners8217 jackets 8220you8217re not miners8221 horrocks said 8220and you8217re not a hero not anymore not to me8221 calder said horrocks and sari walked through the umbilical their footsteps echoed off the gravity generators in the floorboards 8220mind your step at the end there8221 calder said from behind them 8220there8217s a bit of a ridge you8217ll trip if you8217re not careful8221 82208217cause you care8221 horrocks said 8220just being hospitable that8217s how i am8221 calder said and gave sari a hard push horrocks stepped over the ridge and onto the ship sari came in behind him 8220to the right down the alleyway8221 calder said the floor was carpeted in blue shag horrocks couldn8217t remember the last time he8217d seen a carpeted ship the air was overly humid and in need of recycling it smelled of fried food and cinnamon beer 8220another right8221 calder said 8220that8217s it big as an auditorium isn8217t it8221 four long tables had been pushed to the walls twenty men and women surrounded a raised chair set threequarters of the way into the room there was a man in the chair his hair reached past his shoulders and was exceptionally fine much finer than the king8217s horrocks thought the back of the man8217s head was reflected in the sloping window behind him his bald spot gleamed on the surface of the glass like a pink coin the rest of the window was tenanted with stars that shifted counterclockwise jupiter while absent from view was present in a haze that colored the stars orange the man in the chair pushed the sleeves of his suit past his elbows and eased himself forward one leg crooked behind the other 8220horrocks8221 the man said 8220tinton8221 tinton tried to stifle it but a smile took the reins of his face 8220didn8217t think you8217d remember me me a worthless bastard8221 8220i remember8221 horrocks said 8220and your wife8221 tinton said 8220of course i82128221 8220i don8217t remember you8221 sari said she held her arm where the goon had struck her 8220welcome to the res nullius i had to talk to you both face to face someone check them for weapons8221 four bastards strode toward the couple and patted them down 8220be careful where you touch me8221 sari told one of the bastards as his hands worked up past her ribcage the bastard said 8220i wouldn8217t82128221 8220just you mind her delicate areas8221 horrocks said tinton turned to the people milling around his chair 8220get back give me some room to breathe you8217re leeching the air all of you8221 the crowd detached themselves from the throne and loitered by the tables some of the bastards were in their thirties a few were in their twenties and one was no older than eight they all shared similar features light eyebrows a slender nose sharp green eyes weak cheekbones long limbs all of them had gray in their hair even the youngest tinton turned back to horrocks with an apologetic look on his face 8220the king is dead you know that8221 he said 8220i know two days ago someone tried to kill him but they got one of his sons instead8221 horrocks said he took a step toward tinton but his shirt was caught by a guard standing behind him 8220one of his real sons the king only had three now two of them are dead8221 8220we8217re his sons8221 tinton said he sat back in mock relaxation then inched forward again 8220we8217re all of us his sons and daughters the king has an enormous supply of children if he8217d only acknowledge us8221 8220he never will8221 sari said tinton sighed through his nose and folded his arms in his lap 8220he8217s dead8221 8220you need him to be dead that8217s the only way you8217ve a claim on his kingdom if he8217s dead8221 horrocks said tinton8217s mouth became hard 8220he might be alive though i doubt it if he is alive he will acknowledge us as his own we8217ll make him see it our way no father could turn his back on a family so earnestly seeking his favor bring out the doctor8221 a short man with white hair was escorted to tinton8217s chair there was a deep shadowy crease down the center of the man8217s forehead a baldric of surgical tools hung across his white smock his left hand was bandaged he bowed curtly and shuffled backward the crowd swallowed him whole 8220you kidnapped him8221 horrocks said 8220he came to me8221 tinton said 8220he knows the king will need immediate care if he8217s found and he knows we have the best chance of finding him8221 8220how8221 horrocks said 8220if he8217s alive i8217m the one who8217s going to find him i know him best i have the experience8221 horrocks tried to take another step forward and was again checked by the guard behind him 8220i know about your experience during the push everybody knows i8217m not the one who8217ll be looking that would be unseemly we8217ve hired guilfoyle8221 8220guilfoyle that fucking grave robber8221 horrocks said 8220say what you want about guilfoyle but he never quits8221 horrocks looked at tinton in disgust 8220guilfoyle8221 8220i hear you saved his life8221 tinton said 8220during the push8221 horrocks said 8220i understand he8217s never forgiven you8221 horrocks didn8217t respond 8220i know the queen engaged you to find the king8221 tinton said 8220you need to find him more than we do if you do find him hand him over it8217ll make for a smoother transition8221 8220nothing8217s going to be smooth about this transition8221 sari said 8220you need to find him you have more to gain8221 tinton said 8220that8217s not why we8217re here i have nothing to gain8221 horrocks said 8220so much to lose then your furnace your insignificant furnace mine that relies on the king8217s protection without the king you8217re naked we all know what happens to a kingdom without a king first it goes to shit then it goes to the strongest person out there that8217s me i8217ll rape that mine of yours8221 horrocks rushed forward and was met by a tide of bastards 8220you don8217t know a thing you brat8221 horrocks yelled tinton rose out of his chair and shouted horrocks down 8220i know what you paid for that mine you will lose it to me8221 the bastards pushed horrocks back sari whispered into his ear tinton sat down 8220the queen8221 horrocks said 8220the queen is hiding8221 tinton said 8220she has no power no support tell her to stay hidden because when she comes up for air we8217ll choke her8221 he picked at the armrests one of them came loose and he jiggled it with his fingertips 8220stay hidden it suits her and her weak boy i am the king8217s oldest living son8221 8220you8217re an illegitimate hopeful8221 horrocks said 8220my mother was a furnace whore she serviced the miners8221 tinton said 8220all of us here have proof the king is our father if we8217re hopeful it8217s only for what8217s ours acknowledgement and the inheritance of the kingdom8221 sari squeezed horrocks8217 hand she knew he was out of breath he could try and hide it but she could always tell it happened so often a few bastards by the tables were shoving each other a portion of jupiter rolled into view a bright crescent framed in the window behind tinton the planet always reminded sari of a child8217s arts and crafts assignment a glass globe filled with layers of colored sand somewhere around jupiter would be his numerous moons but the windowpane was cheap and made distinction impossible calder came into the room his rifle was gone he held a rectangular gray box in both hands a confusing array of capped wires sagged from the lid tinton got off his seat took the box from calder and walked toward horrocks 8220your spot drive8221 tinton said he gripped the wires like a lock of hair and pulled them out tinton cocked his head to the side and studied horrocks8217 face then lifted the impotent spot drive over his head and dashed it to the floor 8220i hope you weren8217t planning on getting anywhere in a hurry8221
