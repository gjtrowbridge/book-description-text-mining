 chapter one england 1806 my dear miss march i pray youll forgive me for being presumptuous enough to contact you in this rather unconventional manner so tell me miss wickersham have you any experience from somewhere deep in the sprawling jacobean mansion a tremendous crash sounded although the portly butler who was conducting the interview visibly flinched and the housekeeper standing at rigid attention beside the tea table let out an audible squeak samantha refused to so much as blink instead she drew a neat packet of papers from the side pocket of the battered leather portmanteau resting at her feet and held them out im sure youll find my letters of reference are in order mr beckwith although it was midday the light in the modest breakfast parlor was abysmal shafts of sunlight bled through the cracks in the heavy velvet drapes striping the rich ruby weave of the turkish carpet the wax candles scattered across the occasional tables filled the corners with flickering shadows the room smelled musty and close as if it had gone unaired for ages if not for the absence of black swags over the windows and mirrors samantha would have sworn someone very dear to the household had recently died the butler took the papers from her whitegloved hand and unfolded them as the housekeeper craned her long neck to peer over his shoulder samantha could only pray the dim light would work to her advantage preventing them from studying the scrawled signatures too closely mrs philpot was a handsome woman of indeterminate age as sleek and narrow as the butler was round although her face was unlined silver frosted the black chignon anchored at her nape as you can see i served two years as governess for lord and lady carstairs samantha informed mr beckwith as he gave the papers a cursory thumbingthrough once the war resumed i joined several other governesses in volunteering to treat sailors and soldiers who returned from sea or the front with debilitating wounds the housekeeper could not quite hide the faint tightening of her lips samantha knew there were still those in society who believed women who nursed soldiers to be little more than glorified camp followers immodest creatures who wouldnt even blush to look upon a strange mans nakedness feeling heat rise to her own cheeks samantha lifted her chin another notch mr beckwith examined her over the top of his wirerimmed spectacles i must confess miss wickersham that youre a trifle bit younger than what we had in mind such strenuous duty might require a woman of more ma turity perhaps one of the other applicants at samanthas arch look he trailed off i dont see any other applicants mrbeckwith she pointed out sliding her own illfitting spectacles up her nose with one finger given the generous even extravagant wages you offered in your advertisement i fully expected to find them lined up outside your gates another crash came this one even closer than the last it sounded as if some sort of massive beast were lumbering toward its den mrs philpot hastened around the chair her starched petticoats rustling would you care for some more tea my dear as she poured from the porcelain pot her hand trembled so violently that tea splashed over the rim of samanthas saucer and into her lap thank you samantha murmured surreptitiously dabbing at the spreading stain with her glove the floor beneath their feet visibly shuddered as did mrs philpot the muffled roar that followed was peppered by a string of mercifully unintelligible oaths there could no longer be any denying it someone or something was approaching casting a panicked look at the gilded double door that led to the next chamber mr beckwith lurched to his feet his prominent brow glistening with sweat perhaps this isnt the most opportune time as he shoved the letters of reference back at samantha mrs philpot whisked the cup and saucer out of her other hand and deposited them back on the tea cart with a noisy rattle beckwith is right my dear youll have to forgive us we may have been entirely too hasty the woman pulled samantha to her feet and began to tug her away from the door and toward the heavily curtained french windows that led to the terrace but my bag samantha protested casting the portmanteau a helpless glance over her shoulder dont worry child mrs philpot assured her gritting her teeth in a kindly smile well have one of the footmen bring it out to your hack as the thunderous crashing and cursing swelled the woman dug her nails into the sturdy brown wool of samanthas sleeve and yanked her into motion mr beckwith dashed around them and whipped open one of the floortoceiling windows flooding the gloom with bright april sunshine but before mrs philpot could urge samantha through it the mysterious racket ceased the three of them turned as one to gaze at the gilded doors on the opposite side of the room for a moment there was no sound at all except for the delicate ticking of the french gilt clock on the mantel then came a most curious noise as if something were fumbling or perhaps even scratching at the doors something large and angry samantha took an involuntary step backward the housekeeper and butler exchanged an apprehensive glance the doors came flying open striking the opposite walls with a mighty crash framed by their wings was not a beast but a man or what was left of one after all the genteel veneer of society had been stripped away his tawny hair shaggy from neglect hung well past his shoulders shoulders that came close to filling the breadth of the doorway a pair of buckskin pantaloons clung to his lean hips and hugged every curve of his muscular calves and thighs several days growth of beard shadowed his jaw lending his visage a piratical aspect
