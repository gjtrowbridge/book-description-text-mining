 one copenhagen denmark thursday june 22 the present 250 pm cotton malone spotted the knife at the same time he saw stephanie nelle he was sitting at a table outside the caf233 nikolaj comfortable in a white lattice chair the sunny afternoon was pleasant and h248jbro plads the popular danish square that spanned out before him bristled with people the caf233 was doing its usual brisk business8212the mood feverish8212and for the past half hour he8217d been waiting for stephanie she was a petite woman in her sixties though she never confirmed her age and the justice department personnel records that malone once saw contained only a winking na in the space reserved for date of birth her dark hair was streaked with waves of silver and her brown eyes offered both the compassionate look of a liberal and the fiery glint of a prosecutor two presidents had tried to make her attorney general but she8217d turned both offers down one attorney general had lobbied hard to fire her8212especially after she was enlisted by the fbi to investigate him8212but the white house nixed the idea since among other things stephanie nelle was scrupulously honest in contrast the man with the knife was short and stout with narrow features and brushcut hair something haunted loomed on his east european face8212a forlornness that worried malone more than the glistening blade8212and he was dressed casually in denim pants and a bloodred jacket malone rose from his seat but kept his eyes trained on stephanie he thought of shouting a warning but she was too far away and there was too much noise between them his view of her was mo mentarily blocked by one of the modernistic sculptures that dotted h248jbro plads8212this one of an obscenely obese woman lying naked on her belly her obtrusive buttocks rounded like windswept mountains when stephanie appeared from the other side of the cast bronze the man with the knife had moved closer and malone watched as he severed a strap that draped her left shoulder jerked a leather bag free then shoved stephanie to the flagstones a woman screamed and commotion erupted at the sight of a purse snatcher brandishing a knife red jacket rushed ahead stephanie8217s bag in hand and shouldered people out of his way a few pushed back the thief angled left around another of the bronzed sculptures and finally broke into a run his route seemed aimed at k248bmagergade a pedestrianonly lane that twisted north out of h248jbro plads deeper into the city8217s shopping district malone bounded from the table determined to cut off the assailant before he could turn the corner but a cluster of bicycles blocked his way he circled the cycles and sprinted forward partially orbiting a fountain before tackling his prey they slammed into hard stone red jacket taking most of the impact and malone immediately noticed that his opponent was muscular red jacket undaunted by the attack rolled once then brought a knee into malone8217s stomach the breath left him in a rush and his guts churned red jacket sprang to his feet and raced up k248bmagergade malone stood but instantly crouched over and sucked a couple of shallow breaths damn he was out of practice he caught hold of himself and resumed pursuit his quarry now possessing a fiftyfoot head start malone had not seen the knife during their struggle but as he plowed up the street between shops he saw that the man still grasped the leather bag his chest burned but he was closing the gap red jacket wrenched a flower cart away from a scraggly old man one of many carts that lined both h248jbro plads and k248bmagergade malone hated the vendors who enjoyed blocking his bookshop especially on saturdays red jacket flung the cart down the cobbles in malone8217s direction he could not let the cart run free8212too many people on the street including children8212so he darted right grasped hold and twisted it to a stop he glanced back and saw stephanie round the corner onto k248bmagergade along with a policeman they were half a football field away and he had no time to wait malone dashed ahead wondering where the man was heading perhaps he8217d left a vehicle or a driver was waiting where k248bmagergade emptied into another of copenhagen8217s busy squares hauser plads he hoped not that place was a nightmare of congestion beyond the web of peopleonly lanes that formed the shoppers8217 mecca known as str248get his thighs ached from the unexpected workout the muscles barely recalling his days with the navy and the justice department after a year of voluntary retirement his exercise regimen would not impress his former employer ahead loomed the round tower nestled firmly against the trinity church like a thermos bound to a lunch pail the burly cylindrical structure rose nine stories denmark8217s christian iv had erected it in 1642 and the symbol of his reign8212a gilded 4 embraced by a c8212 glistened on its somber brick edifice five streets intersected where the round tower stood and red jacket could choose any one of them for his escape police cars appeared one screeched to a stop on the south side of the round tower another came from farther down k248bmagergade blocking any escape to the north red jacket was now contained in the plaza that encircled the round tower his quarry hesitated seeming to appraise the situation then scampered right and disappeared inside the round tower what was the fool doing there was no way out besides the groundfloor portal but maybe red jacket didn8217t know that malone ran to the entrance he knew the man in the ticket booth the norwegian spent many hours in malone8217s bookshop english literature his passion 8220arne where did that man go8221 he asked in danish catching his wind 8220ran right by without paying8221 8220anybody up there8221 8220an older couple went up a little while ago8221 no elevator or stairs led to the top instead a spiral causeway wound a path straight to the summit originally installed so that bulky seventeenthcentury astronomical instruments could be wheeled up the story local tour guides liked to tell was of how russia8217s peter the great once rode up on horseback while his empress followed in a carriage malone could hear footfalls echoing from the flooring above he shook his head at what he knew awaited him 8220tell the police we8217re up there8221 he started to run halfway up the spiraling incline he passed a door leading into the large hall the glassed entrance was locked the lights off ornamented double windows lined the tower8217s outer walls but each was ironbarred he listened again and could still hear running from above he continued ahead his breathing growing thick and hampered he slowed his pace when he passed a medieval planet plotter affixed high on the wall he knew the exit onto the roof platform was just a few feet away around the ramp8217s final bend he heard no more footsteps he crept forward and stepped through the archway an octago nal observatory8212not from christian iv8217s time but a more recent incarnation8212rose in the center with a wide terrace encircling to his left a decorative iron fence surrounded the observatory its only entrance chained shut on his right intricate wroughtiron latticework lined the tower8217s outer edge beyond the low railing loomed the city8217s redtiled rooftops and green spires he rounded the platform and found an elderly man lying prone behind the body red jacket stood with a knife to an older woman8217s throat his arm encasing her chest she seemed to want to scream but fear quelled her voice 8220keep still8221 malone said to her in danish he studied red jacket the haunted look was still there in the dark almost mournful eyes beads of sweat glistened in the bright sun everything signaled that malone should not step any closer footfalls from below signaled that the police would arrive in a few moments 8220how about you cool down8221 he asked trying english he could see the man understood him but the knife stayed in place red jacket8217s gaze kept darting away off to the sky then back he seemed unsure of himself and that concerned malone even more desperate people always did desperate things 8220put the knife down the police are coming there8217s no way out8221 red jacket looked to the sky again then refocused on malone indecision stared back at him what was this a purse snatcher who flees to the top of a hundredfoot tower with nowhere to go footfalls from below grew louder 8220the police are here8221 red jacket backed closer to the iron railing but kept his grip tight on the elderly woman malone sensed the steeliness of an ultimatum forcing some choice so he made clear again 8220there8217s no way out8221 red jacket tightened his grip on the woman8217s chest then he staggered back now firmly against the waisthigh outer railing nothing beyond him and his hostage but air the eyes lost their panic and a sudden calm swept over the man he shoved the old woman forward and malone caught her before she lost her balance red jacket made the sign of the cross and with stephanie8217s bag in hand pivoted out over the railing screamed one word82128220beauseant82218212then slashed the knife across his throat as his body plunged to the street the woman howled as the police emerged from the portal malone let her go and rushed to the rail red jacket lay sprawled on the cobbles one hundred feet below he turned and looked back to the sky past the flagpole atop the observatory the danish dannebrog8212a white cross upon a red banner8212limp in the still air what had the man been looking at and why did he jump he gazed back down and saw stephanie elbowing her way through the growing crowd her leather bag lay a few feet from the dead man and he watched as she yanked it from the cobbles then dissolved back into the spectators he followed her with his gaze as she plowed through the people and scuttled away down one of the streets that led from the round tower deeper into the busy str248get never looking back he shook his head at her hasty retreat and muttered 8220what the hell8221
