 the telephone call that set in motion the events that would eventually end my intelligence career came as i was preparing for bed saturday june 17 1972 quotdick are you still upquot quotyes howardquot it was a familiar voice at this time of night howard osborn the cia chief of security did not need to identify himself quotive just learned that the district police have picked up five men in a breakin at the democratic party national headquarters at the watergatequot quotyesquot osborn was not given to idle chatter he obviously had a brick to drop quotfour cubans and jim mccordquot quotmccord retired out of your shopquot osborn drew a deep breath quottwo years agoquot i remembered james mccord as a serious straitlaced staff security and counteraudio specialist he had retired with a good record i was baffled quotwhat about the cubansmiami or havanaquot quotmiamiquot osborn said quickly quotflorida exiles theyve been in this country for some time nowquot quotdo we know themquot quotas of now i cant sayquot quotget hold of the operations people first thing have them get on to miami check every record here and in miamiquot quotokay first thing tomorrowquot quotis that all of itquot quotno not halfquot osborn said heavily quothoward hunt also seems to be involved in some wayquot it was my turn for a deep breath i knew that hunt a former cia officer was also retired marine lieutenant general robert e cushman my deputy had mentioned a year or so previously that hed been told hunt was employed at the white house as a security consultant and involved with the special investigations group responsible for looking into security leaks this was the outfit that became known as the quotplumbersquot while with cia hunt had worked in latin america mexico and europe before his retirement he served with the task force responsible for the bay of pigs operation quotwhat in hell were they doing in the democratic party officesquot osborn paused almost as if he couldnt quite believe what he was about to say quotim not sure what they were doing but as of now it looks as if they might have been trying to tap the phones and bug the placequot it was a moment before i could say quotis there any indication that we could be involved in thisquot quotnone whatsoeverquot osborn replied quotstay on top of itquot i said quotand see me before the staff meeting monday morningquot despite occasional taunts from congressional members and the press cia was a highly disciplined organization before admiral rufus taylor gave up his assignment as cia deputy director to return to the navy he remarked that the agency was quotthe most disciplined organizationquot in which he had ever served quotincluding the us navyquot the notion that the agency or anyone in it would undertake a caper as bizarre as the breakin and attempted bugging of a national political party was quite simply preposterous still sitting on the edge of the bed i decided to telephone patrick gray who was acting fbi director while waiting for senate approval hed not had time to gain much knowledge of the internal white house workings and i wanted to be sure he was in the picture it took a few more minutes than usual for the everefficient white house switchboard to locate gray in a los angeles hotel room gray said that he had been informed of the breakin but had no details i filled him in as much as i could and assured him that despite the background of the apparent perpetrators cia had nothing to do with the breakin i added that i couldnt imagine what anyone could hope to gain by breaking into those offices gray listened politely but had little to say quotyou might want to look into the relationship of john ehrlichman the presidents domestic policy advisor with mccord and huntquot i said quothell be familiar with the circumstances in which howard hunt was hired for work at the white house and with mccords job on the committee to reelect the president as wellquot gray remained unresponsive after repeating my assurance that cia was not involved with any of the breakin group i put the phone down when i first heard that hunt was working as a security consultant at the white house it struck me as peculiar that no one there had called to verify with me or the agency his career and reputation as a matter of common practice someone would have checked with usofficially or quietlybefore hiring any former employee for a sensitive white house job the first time the agency heard from hunt in his new job was in july 1971 when ehrlichman telephoned my deputy general cushman to tell him that hunt would be coming to see him for assistance hunt arrived a few days later and asked the general to supply some operational geara disguise wig a voicealtering device and false personalidentification documents cushman did so and requested that the gear be returned after use the decision to supply the equipment might be interpreted as falling within the deputy director of central intelligences area of responsibility but it was a very close call as bob later remarked he wished he had at the outset left the baby at my doorstep by the time the breakin scandal was in full flower it was too late for any mondaymorning quarterbacking on my part the gear was not returned and hunts requests for operational material continued to escalate until he asked that his former secretary be detached from her job in paris to work in his white house office at this point general cushman informed me of hunts various demands the petition for a secretary was of course refused as were subsequent requests for telephone answering services cover for notional offices and such now after almost a year of silence we thought we had heard the last of hunt by the time of my mondaymorning staff meeting the washington media were aboil with the news of the breakin it was confirmed that mccord had been arrested at the scene but neither the washington post nor the new york times mentioned hunt it was all too clear that although the problem apparently rested with the white house the arrest of a retired agency officer the possible involvement of another and the ties the cubanamericans had to the agency would have an explosive impact on the press after a general discussion i went around the conference table asking each of the senior officers if he knew of any possible cia involvement in the watergate breakin none did and it seemed obvious to us all that the most cia could do was quickly to establish rocksolid proof that despite its previous relations with the burglars the agency had nothing to do with the breakin and then to distance itself from the incident my instructions in effect were quotkeep cool do not get lured into any speculation dont volunteer any information and just stay the hell away from the whole damned messquot it was not long before the notion of quotdistancingquot became a lame joke our exhaustive records search confirmed that the cubanamericans arrested at the watergate had formerly been listed as agency contacts in the miami area and that one was still on a 100amonth retainer press reports that hunt was deeply involved spread quickly across the front pages and tv screens a check signed by hunt was found in the hotel room used as a makeshift observation point and notebooks with his name and telephone number were taken from the burglars pockets hunts bizarre involvement was a major embarrassment in most circumstances it is difficult enough to prove a negative it is all but out of the question to do so in secret operations we were soon to learn that it is impossible to prove anything to an inflamed national press corps already in full cry although we repeatedly denied the accusations what seemed to be daily leaks to the press kept pointing at cia this was not the first time the agency had been pilloried by selfserving washington sources but these incidents had been shortlived and our denials were accepted by other agencies and in time by wellinformed reporters in this instance we got no support from the administration or congress and the leaks continued relentlessly cia cooperation with the fbi was correct but seemed unavailing one question arose repeatedly were the leaks coming from the fbi in j edgar hoovers day this would not have been the case but what about the new bureau administration was discipline as strong as it had been we did not know today after the hours of sworn testimonythe fbi file is said to contain 16000 pagespublication of thousands of pages of memoirs and the raw evidence exposed in the white house tapes it seems incredible that at the time the probability that the leaks were coming directly from the white house did not occur to me or to anyone on my staff later when evidence began to emerge showing clearly that the most senior members of the white house staff were involved in this featherbrained crime none of us realized that from the moment the news of the arrests reached the white house president nixon was personally manipulating the administrations effort to contain the scandal the day after the first newsbreak i went to the capitol for routine testimony before the senate foreign relations committee as i entered the hearing room the committee chairman senator william fulbright took me to one side and in a low voice asked quothave you read about the breakin at the democratic national committeequot quotoh yesquot i said quotyes indeedquot quotwhat on earth could they have been trying to findquot quotive no ideaquot i answered shaking my head quotits as nutty an episode as i can recallquot i waited a moment before saying quottheres one thing i can tell you mr chairmanquot senator fulbright moved a bit closer quotdespite all the allegations we didnt have a damned thing to do with itquot quotit doesnt read like one of your operationsquot he said quotbut you understand i felt i had to askquot he smiled and took my arm as we moved to take our places this was the only time the breakin was mentioned at the hearing press reports soon indicated that hunt and mccord and their confederates were attempting to photograph files bug the telephones and arrange electronic monitoring of the democratic committee i could not understand why anyone would think there was anything to be gained from such a halfbaked and technically difficult operation that would possibly warrant the risks involved on june 23 general vernon quotdickquot walters who had replaced general cushman with seven weeks on the job and i were summoned to the white house for a meeting with john ehrlichman this was the only time i can recall having been directed to bring my deputy with me to a white house meeting because the tone was that of a command rather than an invitation i suggested that general walters and i have lunch in a downtown hotel and arrive at the meeting together it did not take a great gift of imagination to guess what the meeting would be about and it seemed unfair to risk letting any of the white house heavy hitters catch dick walters alone he agreed with alacrity to my knowledge general walterss military history is unique not only did he rise from private to retire as a lieutenant general but his entire career as an officer was spent in intelligencerelated assignments dick walters was heavyset with a genial manner a hearty laugh and the ability to speak rapidly and eloquently in actual sentencessomething of a rarity in the bureaucracy he was a gifted raconteur and apparently never forgot a good story when he repeated an anecdote it was always in exactly the same manner and in the identical words i often wondered if this trick of memory contributed to his extraordinary linguistic ability walters was fluent in a number of languages and i suspect could make his way in a great many more as an interpreter he had the admirable knack of conveying not only the words he was translating but also the sense of the message when walters came into the agency averell harriman former ambassador to the ussr and governor of new york told me that although their political views were quite different he had found walters thoroughly reliable in carrying out instructions at the time of ehrlichmans summons the agencys line into the white house was through henry kissinger who was then nixons national security advisor in kissingers absence we worked with his deputy alexander haig and had had very little contact with any other white house staffers a graduate student might write a dissertation on the geography and decor of the rabbit warren of white house offices and how the frequent reallocation of space and redecoration mark the changing fortunes of the staff proximity to the presidents offices is the ultimate goal of every ambitiousthat is to say everywhite house aide close on the heels of proximity as a mark of favor come the size and aspect of the office space the bigger the better a view of anything not a wall or parking lot is next best but if a visitor has not been around for a couple of months and if a crisis has intervened everything is likely to have changed office space will have been reallocated and temporary partitions shifted we parked in the visitors lot beside the west wing and made our way through a basement entrance to an elevator the size of a telephone booth on the second floor we were escorted to what looked like an anteroom but turned out to be john ehrlichmans conference chamber i am tall even in those days dick walters had a certain bulk and ehrlichmans mere presence took up some space we had scarcely wedged ourselves onto the straightbacked chairs around the conference table when h r quotbobquot haldeman the white house chief of staff marched into the room and took over the meeting after a few general observations about the serious nature of the allegations involving important people in the presidents election campaign he turned to me and asked very formally what connection cia might have with the watergate breakin quotthe cia had no connection whatever with watergatequot i said haldeman ignored this and went on to say that the fbi investigation of certain mexican leads might jeopardize agency activity there his tone stiffened as he added quotit has been decided to have general walters go to see pat gray and tell him that further investigation in mexico could lead to the exposure of certain agency assets and channels for handling moneyquot quotjust yesterdayquot i said quoti told pat gray again that the agency was not involved and that none of the suspects had worked for us in the past two yearsquot it seemed unlikely that haldeman could possibly know more about cia equities and funding channels than i did but i decided to wait and hear what else he had in mind
