 resurrecting childhood joy what is the passion of your soul do you know have you lost your raw child energy we cannot all build careers around passion such as many artists are able to do but we can all stay connected to that early joy i love riding horses and i rode often until i was in my midtwenties throughout my life i dreamed of owning a horse ranch in tucson arizona where my family vacationed throughout my childhood and where my brother greg now lives whether that ever happens and i still hold on to the hope that it will i can still ride horses in my home state of maryland i can still live part of my dream i recently got on a horse again after a twodecade break at my friend marian shaws 190acre farm off the chester river in eastern maryland as she was adjusting my stirrups on a mare named iris of all names i put my head on the horses red mane stroked her sinewy neck and the smell of sweat and hay shot me back to my horse chico from girlhood and the tobaccochewing cowboys who led us on trails through the arizona desert cowboy frank is an indelible memory he wore tight jeans and smoked camel nonfilters and he made the best scrambled eggs fried in bacon grease on breakfast rides this while drinking a coors beer from the can with tears streaming through the dust on my cheeks i took off with marian next to fields of soybeans and new emerald green wheat everything good and right about riding came rushing back to me loping against the wind my muscles molded onto the horses muscles moving as one like a sexy slow dance as we eased to a halt i let a hot and glisteny iris chomp on some bushes then put my hands on the horn of the western saddle and threw my head back under a blinding october sun and surging with history my whole self opened how could i have left horses the sport of my soul i ride as often as i can these days and will never stop that was a huge mistake what are you hankering to do that you stopped doing as parents we are delegated to the sidelines to watch as our children exalt in tackling new sports and activities while we are proud audience members as they learn to horsebackride score goals in soccer excel at ballet and get up on water skis all this can make us want to dig in ourselves pushing ourselves to get off the observation deck and back into the game can make anyone feel giddy like a grownup who is still growing not someone edging over the hill grab your old skateboard or guitar pick up on writing the novel you started in college go back to something you once loved but left you too will feel as if youve unlocked a precious piece of yourself that got buried with time and responsibility
