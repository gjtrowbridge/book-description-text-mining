 blake checked his watch8212thirtysix minutes8212and sighed he tried walking backwards now tapping the books in reverse order to see if this would help pass the time a series of sternlooking portraits glared down at him from the walls like magicians they were dressed in dark capes and had sharp pointy beards elaborate ruffs like squashed chrysanthemums burst from their collars the older men had jaded eyes and tortoiselike skin but there were also a few palefaced boys like himself he glanced at their nameplates thomas sternhold 158782111608 jeremiah wood 153482111609 isaac wilkes 1616821137 lucius st boniface de la croix 159982111666 each man was holding a small book and pointing to a relevant passage with a forefinger as though reminding future generations to remain studious and wellbehaved blake disregarded their frowns of disapproval and continued running his fingers along the books rapping the spines with the back of his knuckles all of a sudden he stopped one of the volumes had struck him back like a cat it had taken a playful swipe at his fingers and ducked back into hiding he whisked his hand away as though stung he looked at his fingers but couldn8217t see anything unusual they were smeared with dust but there was no obvious mark or injury on his skin then he looked at the books to see which one had leaped out at him but they all seemed pretty ordinary too just row upon row of crumbly old volumes like toy soldiers in leather uniforms standing to attention8212except that one of them had tried to force its way into his hand he sucked on his finger thoughtfully a thin trail of blood like a paper cut was forming where the book had nicked his knuckle all around him the library was sleeping in the hot still afternoon shafts of sunlight hung in the air like dusty curtains and a clock ticked somewhere in the distance a ponderous sound that seemed to slow down time small footsteps crept along the floorboards above that was probably his sister duck investigating upstairs but no one else was around only mephistopheles the college cat a sinewy black shadow with claws as sharp as pins was sunbathing on a strip of carpet near the window and he only cared about one thing himself as far as blake could tell he was entirely alone apart that is from whatever was lurking on the shelf
