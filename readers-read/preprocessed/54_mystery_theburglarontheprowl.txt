 chapter one the man said my friend marty gilmartin is an absolute a complete an utter and total he held out his hands shook his head and sighed words fail me apparently i agreed nouns anyway adjectives seem to be supporting you well enough but nouns help me out bernard he said who is more qualified to supply le mot juste words after all are your m233tier they are books are your stockintrade he said and what is a book paper and ink and cloth and glue to be sure but if a book were nothing more than those mundane components no one would want to own more than one of them no its the words that constitute a book sixty or eighty or a hundred thousand of them or two hundred thousand or even three id read grub street recently and was thinking about the lessthaneminent victorians george gissing wrote about forced by their publishers to grind out interminable threevolume novels for a body of readers who clearly had far too much time on their hands thats more words than i require marty said just one bernie to sum up he glanced around the room lowered his voice no to impale crandall rountree mapes like an insect upon a pin an insect i suggested far too mild a worm a rat he was shaking his head so i shifted gears and exited the animal kingdoma bounder thats closer bernie by god he is a bounder but hes much worse than that a cad better but i frowned trying to conjure up a thesaurus spread open before me a bounder a cad a rotter oh that comes close he saidwell settle for that if we cant do any better its just archaic enough isnt it and its better than bounder or cad because its clearly not a temporary condition the corruption is permanent the man is putrid to the core he picked up his glass breathed in the bouquet of aged cognac rotter comes very close indeed to conveying just what a thoroughgoing shitheel goes by the name of crandall rountree mapes i started to say something but he held up a hand to stop me bernie he said wideeyed with wonderdid you hear what i just said shitheel precisely thats perfect the quintessential summation of the man and where do you suppose the word came from not its derivation that would seem clear enough but how did it get into our conversation no one says shitheel anymore you just did i did and i couldnt guess the last time i uttered it he beamed i must have been inspired he said and rewarded himself with a small sip of the venerable brandy i couldnt think of anything id done to merit a reward but i had a sip from my own glass just the same it filled the mouth like liquid gold slid down the gullet like honey and warmed every cell of the body even as it exalted the spirit i wasnt going to drive or operate machinery so what the hell i had another sip we were in the dining room of the pretenders a private club on gramercy park every bit as venerable as the cognac the membership ran to actors and writers men in or on the fringes of the arts but there was a membership category called patron of the theater and it was through that door that martin gilmartin had entered we need members hed told me onceand the main criterion for membership at this point is the possession of a pulse and a checkbook though to look around you you might suspect that some of our members have neither would you like to become a member bernie did you ever see cats if you loved it you can join as a patron of the theater if you hated it you can come in as a critic id passed up the chance to join figuring they might draw the line at prospective members with criminal records but i rarely turned down an invitation to join marty there for lunch the food was passable the drink firstrate and the service impeccable but the halfmile walk from barnegat books led me past eight or ten restaurants that could say the same what they couldnt provide was the rich atmosphere of the nineteenthcentury mansion that housed the pretenders and the aura of history and tradition that permeated the place and then there was martys good company which id be glad of in any surroundings hes an older gentleman and hes what fellows who read esquire want to be when they grow up tall and slender with a yearround tan and a full head of hair the color of old silver hes always well groomed and freshly barbered his mustache trimmed his attire quietly elegant but never foppish while enjoying a comfortable retirement he keeps busy managing his investments and dipping a toe in the water when an attractive business venture comes his way and of course hes a patron of the theater as such he goes to quite a few shows both on and off broadway and occasionally invests a few dollars in a production that strikes his fancy more to the point his theatrical patronage has consisted in large part of underwriting the careers of a succession of theatrical ing233nues some of whom have actually demonstrated a certain modicum of talent dramatic talent that is to say their talent in another more private realm is something upon which only marty could comment and he wouldnt the man is discretion personified we met i would have to say in highly unlikely circumstances
