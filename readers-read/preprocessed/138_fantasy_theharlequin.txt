 malcolm the head of the church of eternal life the vampire church sat across from me hed never been in my office before in fact the last time id seen him hed accused me of doing black magic and being a whore id also killed one of his congregation members on church grounds in front of him and the rest of his congregation the dead vamp had been a serial killer id had a court order of execution but still it hadnt made malcolm and me buddies i sat behind my desk sipping coffee from my newest christmas themed mug a little girl sat on santas lap saying define good i worked hard every year to find the most offensive mug i could so that bert our business manager could throw a fit it had become one of my holiday traditions id at least dressed for the season in red skirt and jacket the shirt was blue instead of green but it was still very festive for me i had a new gun in my shoulder holster a friend of mine had finally persuaded me to give up my browning hipower for something that fit my hand a little better the browning was at home in the gun safe and the heckler and koch p200 was in the holster i felt like i was cheating once upon a time id thought malcolm handsome but that had been when his vampire tricks worked on me without vampire wiles to cloud my perception malcolm was good looking in a way but not handsome his bone structure was too rough almost as if it hadnt quite gotten smoothed out before they put that pale skin on it his hair was cut short and had a little curl to it because to take the curl out of it hed had to have shave it the hair was a bright bright canary yellow its what blond hair does if you take it out of the sun for a few hundred years he looked at me with his blue eyes and smiled and the smile filled his face with personality that same personality that made his sunday morning television program such a hit it wasnt magic it was just him charisma for lack of a better word there was force to malcolm that had nothing to do with vampire powers and everything to do with who he was not what he was hed have been a leader and a mover of men even if hed been alive the smile softened his features filled his face with that zeal that was both compelling and frightening he was a true believer head of a church of true believers the whole idea of a vampire church still creeped me out but it was the fastest growing denomination in the country i was surprised to see your name on my appointment book malcolm i said finally i understand that ms blake i am almost equally surprised to be here fine were both surprised why are you here i suspect you have or will soon have a warrant of execution for a member of my church i managed to keep my face blank but felt the stiffness in my shoulders hed see the reaction and hed know what it meant master vampires dont miss much you have a lot of members malcolm could you narrow it down a little who exactly are we talking about dont be coy ms blake im not being coy youre trying to insinuate that you have a warrant for more than one of my vampires i do not believe it and neither do you i should have felt insulted because i wasnt lying two of his upstanding vamps had been very naughty if your vampires were fully bloodoathed to you youd know i was telling the truth because youd be able to enforce your moral code in entirely new ways a bloodoath was what a vamp did when he joined a new vampire group a new kiss he literally took blood from the master of the city it meant the master had a lot more control over them and the lesser vamps gained in power too if their master was powerful enough a weak master wasnt much help but jeanclaude st louiss master of the city and my sweetie wasnt weak of course the master gained power from the oath as well the more powerful vamp they could oath the more they gained like so many vampire powers it was a two way street i do not want to enforce my moral code i want my people to choose to be good people malcolm said until your congregation is bloodoathed to some master vampire they are loose cannons malcolm you control them by force of personality and morality vampires only understand fear and power how can you say that you are the lover of at least two vampires ms blake how can you say that and mean it i shrugged maybe because i am dating two vampires if that is what being jeanclaudes human servant has taught you ms blake then it is sad things he is teaching you he is the master of the city of st louis malcolm not you you and your church go unmolested by his tolerance i go unmolested because the church grew powerful under the previous master of the city and by the time jeanclaude rose to power we were hundreds he did not have the power to bring me and my people to heel i sipped coffee and thought about my next answer because i couldnt argue with him he was probably right regardless of how we got where we are malcolm you have several hundred vampires in this city jeanclaude let you have them because he thought you were bloodoathing them we learned in october that you arent which means that the vamps with you are cut off from an awful lot of their potential power im okay with that i guess their choice if they understand that it is a choice but no bloodoath means that they are not mystically tied to anyone but the vamp that made them you im told do the deed most of the time though the church deacons do recruit sometimes how our church is organized is not your concern yes i said it is do you serve jeanclaude now when you say that or is it as a federal marshal that you criticize me he narrowed those blue eyes i do not think the federal government knows or understands enough of vampires to care whether i bloodoath my people bloodoathing makes sure the vamps dont do things behind the back for the master bloodoathing takes away their free will ms blake maybe but ive seen the damage they can do with their free will a good master of the city can guarantee that there is no crime among his people they are his slaves malcolm said i shrugged and sat back in my chair are you here to talk about the warrant or to talk about the deadline jeanclaude gave your church both jeanclaude has given you and your church members their choices malcolm either you blood oath them or jeanclaude does or they can move to another city to be blood oathed there but it has to be done it is a choice of who they would be slaves to ms blake it is no choice at all jeanclaude was generous malcolm by vampire law he could have just killed you and your entire congregation and how would the law how would you as a federal marshal have felt about such slaughter are you saying that my being a federal marshal limits jeanclaudes options he values your love anita and you would not love a man that could slaughter my followers you dont add yourself to that list why you are a legal vampire executioner anita if i broke human law you would kill me yourself you would not fault jeanclaude for doing the same if i broke vampiric law you think id just let him kill you i think you would kill me for him if you felt justified a small part of me wanted to argue but he was right id been grandfathered in like most of the vamp executioners that had two or more years on the job and could pass the firearms test the idea was making us federal marshals was the quickest way to grant us the ability to cross state lines and to control us more the crossing state lines and having a badge was great i wasnt sure how controlled we were of course i was the only vampire hunter that was also dating their master of the city most saw it as a conflict of interest frankly so did i but there wasnt much i could do about it you do not argue with me malcolm said i cant decide if you think im a civilizing influence on jeanclaude or a bad one i saw you once as his victim anita now i am no longer certain who is the victim and who the victimizer should i be offended he just looked at me the last time i was in your church you called me evil and accused me of black magic you called jeanclaude immoral and me his whore or something like that you were trying to take away one of my people to be killed with no trail you shot him to death on the church grounds he was a serial killer i had an order of execution for everyone involved in those crimes all the vampires you mean are you implying that humans or shapeshifters were involved no but if they had been you would never have been allowed to shoot them to death with the police helping you do it ive had warrants for shapeshifters before but those are rare anita and there are no orders of execution for humans the death penalty still exists malcolm after a trial and years of appeals if you are human what do you want from me malcolm i want justice the law isnt about justice malcolm its about the law she did not do the crime she is accused of as our wandering brother avery seabrook was innocent of the crime you sought him for he called any of his church group that joined jeanclaude wanderers the fact that avery the vampire had a last name meant he was very recently dead and that he was an american vampire vampires only had one name like madonna or cher and only one vamp per country could have that name duels were fought over the right to use names until now until america we had vampires with last names unheard of i cleared avery legally i didnt have to no you could have shot him dead found out your mistake later and suffered nothing under the law i did not write this law malcolm i just carry it out vampires did not write this law either anita thats true but no human could have mesmerized other humans so that they helped in their own kidnappings humans couldnt fly off with their victims in their arms and that justifies slaughtering us i shrugged again i was going to leave this argument alone because id begun to not like that part of my job i didnt think vampires were monsters anymore it made killing them harder it made executing them when they couldnt fight back monstrous with me as the monster what do you want me to do malcolm sally hunters has a warrant with her name on it witnesses saw her leave the dead womans apartment the woman died by vampire attack i know it wasnt any of jeanclaudes vampires that leaves yours hell i had her drivers liscene picture in the file with the warrant i have to admit that having a picture to go with it made me feel more like an assassin a picture so id get the right one are you so certain of that i blinked at him the slow blink that gave me time to think but didnt look like i was thinking furiously what are you trying to say malcolm im not good at subtle just tell me what you came to say something powerful someone powerful came to my church last week they hid themselves i could not find them in the new faces of my congregation but i know that someone powerful immensely powerful was there he leaned forward his calm exterior cracking round the edges do you understand how powerful they would have to be for me to sense them use all my powers to search the room for them yet not be able to find them i thought about it malcolm was no master of the city but he was probably in the top five of the most powerful vampires in town maybe higher if he wasnt so terribly moral it limited him in some ways i licked my lips careful of the lipstick and nodded did they want you to know they were there or was that part an accident he actually showed surprise for a moment before he got control of his face he played human too much for the media he was beginning to loose that stillness of features that the old ones have i dont know and even his voice was no longer smooth did the vamp do it to taunt you or was it arrogance he shook his head i do not know i had a moment of revelation you came here because you think jeanclaude should know but you cant let your congregation see you going to the master of the city it would undermine your whole free will thing he settled back into his chair fighting to keep the anger off his face and failing he was even more scared than i thought for him to be loosing it this badly in front of someone he disliked hell hed come to me for help he was desperate but you can come to me as a federal marshal and tell me because you know ill tell jeanclaude think what you like ms blake we werent on first name basis anymore id hit it on the head a big bad vamp checks your church out you arent vampire enough to smoke him out and you come to me to jeanclaude and all his immoral power structure you come to the very people you say you hate he stood up the crime that sally is accused of happened less than twentyfour hours after he it they came to my church i do not think that is a coincidence im not lying about the second order of execution malcolm its in my desk drawer right now with a drivers liscene picture of the vampire in question he sat back down what name is one it why so you can warn them id almost said she because it was another female vamp my people are not perfect ms blake but i believe that another vampire has come to town and is framing them why why would someone do that i dont know no one has bothered jeanclaude or his people i know malcolm said without a true master a true bloodoathed mystically connected master your congregation are just sheep waiting for the wolves to come get them jeanclaude said as much a month ago yeah he did i thought at first that it was one of the new vampires that has joined jeanclaude one of the ones from europe but it is not it is something more powerful than that or it is a group of vampires combining their powers through their masters marks i have felt such power only once before when i asked he shook his head we are forbidden to speak of it on penalty of death only if they contact us directly can we break this silence it sounds like youve already been contacted i said he shook his head again they are tampering with me and my people because technically i am outside normal vampire law did jeanclaude report to the council that my church had not blood oathed any of its followers i nodded yes he did he put his big hands over his face and leaned over his knees almost as if he was faint he whispered i feared as much okay malcolm youre moving too fast for me here what does jeanclaude reporting to the council have to do with some group of powerful vamps messing with your church he looked at me but his eyes had gone gray with worry tell him what i have told you he will understand but i dont i have until new years day to give jeanclaude my answer about the bloodoathing he has been generous and patient but there are those among the council that are neither of those things i had hoped they would be proud of what i had accomplished i thought it would please them but i fear now that the council is not ready to see my brave new world of free will free will is for humans malcolm the preternatural community is about control he stood again you have almost complete discretion on how the warrant is executed anita will you use some of that discretion to find the truth before you kill my followers i stood up i cant guarantee anything i would not ask that i ask only that you look for the truth before it is too late for sally and my other follower whose name you will not even give me he sighed i have not sent sally running out of town why would i warn the other you came through the door knowing sally was in trouble im not helping you figure the other bad guy out it is a man then i just looked at him glad that i could give full eye contact it had always been so hard to do the tough stare back when i couldnt look a vamp in the eyes he straightened his shoulders as if only now aware that he was slumping you wont even give me that will you please tell jeanclaude what i have told you i should have come to you immediately i thought morals kept me from running to the very power structure i despise but it wasnt morals it was sin the sin of pride i hope that my pride has not cost more of my followers their lives he went for the door i called after him malcolm he turned how big an emergency is this big will a couple of hours make a difference he thought about it perhaps why do you ask i wont be seeing jeanclaude tonight i just wanted to know if i should call him give him a heads up yes by all means give him his heads up he frowned at me why would you not see your master tonight anita arent you living with him actually no i stay over at his place about half the week but ive got my own place still will you be killing more of my kindred tonight i shook my head then you will raise my other colder brethren whos blissful death will you disturb tonight anita whos zombie will you raise so some human can get their inheritance or a wife can be consoled no zombies tonight i said i was too puzzled by his attitude on the zombies to be insulted id never heard a vampire claim any kinship with zombies or ghouls or anything but other vamps then what will keep you from your masters arms ive got a date not that its any of your business but not a date with jeanclaude or asher i shook my head your wolf king then richard i shook my head again who would you abandon those three for anita ah your leopard king micah wrong again i am amazed that you are answering my questions so am i actually i think its because you keep calling me a whore and i think i want to rub your face in it what the fact that you are a whore his face showed nothing when he said it i knew you couldnt do it i said do what ms blake i knew you couldnt play nice long enough to get my help i knew if i kept at you youd get snotty and mean he gave a small bow just from the neck i told you ms blake my sin is pride and whats my sin malcolm do you want me to insult you ms blake i just want to hear you say it why why not i said very well your sin is lust ms blake as it is the sin of your master and all his vampires i shook my head and felt that unpleasant smile curl my lips the smile that left my eyes cold and usually meant i was well and truly pissed thats not my sin malcolm not the one nearest and dearest to my heart and what would your sin be ms blake wrath malcolm its wrath are you saying ive made you angry im always angry malcolm you just gave me a target to focus it on do you envy anyone ms blake i thought about it then shook my head not really no i will not ask about sloth you work entirely too hard for that to be an issue you are not greedy nor a glutton are you prideful sometimes i said wrath lust and pride then i nodded i guess if were keeping score oh someone is keeping score ms blake never doubt that im christian too malcolm do you worry about getting into heaven ms blake it was such an odd question that i answered it i did for awhile but my faith still makes my cross glow my prayers still have the power to chase the evil things away god hasnt forsaken me just all the right wing fundamentalist christians want to believe he has ive seen evil malcolm real evil and you arent that he smiled and it was gentle and almost embarrassed have i come to you for absolution ms blake i dont think im the one to give you absolution i would like a priest to hear my sins before i die ms blake but none will come near me they are holy and the very trappings of their calling will burst into flames at my presence not true the holy items only go off if the true believer panics or if you try vampire powers on them he blinked at me and i realized his eyes held unshed tears shimmering in the over head lights is this true ms blake i promise it is his attitude was beginning to make me afraid for him i didnt want to be afraid for malcolm i had enough people in my life that i cared for enough to worry about i did not need to add the undead billy graham to my list do you know any priests that might be willing to hear a very long confession i might though i dont know if theyre allowed to give you absolution since technically in the eyes of the church youre already dead you have ties to a lot of the religious community malcolm surely one of the other leaders would be willing i do not want to ask them anita i do not want them to know my sins i would rather he hesitated then spoke but i was pretty sure it wasnt the sentence he started to use quietly i would rather it be done quietly why the sudden need for confession and absolution i am still a believer ms blake being a vampire has not changed that i wish to die absolved of my sins why are you expecting to die tell jeanclaude what i have told you about the stranger or strangers in my church tell him about my desire for a priest to hear my confession he will understand malcolm he kept walking but stopped with his hand on the door i take back what i said ms blake i am not sorry i came i am only sorry i did not come days ago with that he walked out and closed the door softly behind him i sat down at my desk and called jeanclaude i had no idea what was going on but something was up something big something bad
