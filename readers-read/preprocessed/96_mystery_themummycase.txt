 i never meant to marry in my opinion a woman born in the last half of the nineteenth century of the christian era suffered from enough disadvantages without willfully embracing another that is not to say that i did not occasionally indulge in daydreams of romantic encounters for i was as sensible as any other female of the visible attractions of the opposite sex but i never expected to meet a man who was my match and i had no more desire to dominate a spouse than to be ruled by him marriage in my view should be a balanced stalemate between equal adversaries i had resigned myself to a life of spinsterhood when at a somewhat advanced age i met radcliffe emerson our first encounter was not romantic never will i forget my initial sight of emerson as we stood face to face in that dismal hall of the boulaq museum his black beard bristling his blue eyes blazing his fists clenched his deep baritone voice bellowing invectives at me for dusting off the antiquities yet even as i answered his criticism in kind i knew in my heart that our lives would be intertwined i had several logical sensible reasons for accepting emersons offer of marriage emerson was an egyptologist and my first visit to the realm of the pharaohs planted seeds of affection for that antique land that were soon to blossom into luxuriant flower emersons keen intelligence and acerbic tongue which had won him the title father of curses from his devoted egyptian workmen made him a foeman worthy of my steel and yet dear reader these were not my real reasons for yielding to emersons suit i deplore clich233s but in this case i must resort to one emerson swept me off my feet i am determined to be completely candid as i pen these pages for i have made certain they will not be published at least during my lifetime they began as a personal journal perused only by a critic whose intimate relationship gave him access to my private thoughts so he claimed at any rate as his remarks on style and content of my writing became more critical i decided to disallow the claim and lock up my journals they are therefore mine alone and unless my heirs decide that the scholarly world should not be deprived of the insights contained therein which may well occur no eyes but mine will read these words why then the gentle reader will ask do i infer his or her existence by addressing her or him the answer should be obvious art cannot exist in a vacuum the creative spirit must possess an audience it is impossible for a writer to do herself justice if she is only talking to herself having established this important point i return to my narrative not only did emerson sweep me off my feet i swept him off his i speak figuratively of course by current standards i am not beautiful fortunately for me emersons tastes in this area as in most others are highly original my complexion which others find sallow and dark he described on one memorable occasion as resembling the honey of hymettus my coarse jetblack hair which refuses to remain confined in braids buns or nets arouses in him a peculiar variety of tactile enjoyment and his remarks about my figure which is unfashionably slender in some areas and overly endowed in others cannot be reproduced even here by any standards emerson is a remarkably finelooking man he stands over six feet tall and his stalwart frame possesses the elasticity and muscular development of youth thanks to a vigorous outdoor life under the rays of the benevolent egyptian sun his brawny arms and rugged face turn goldenbrown forming a striking setting for the sapphire brilliance of his eyes the removal of his beard at my urgent request uncovered a particularly attractive dimple in his chin emerson prefers to call it a cleft when he refers to the feature at all but it is a dimple his hair is sable thick and soft shining with titian gleams in the sunlight but enough of that suffice it to say that the wedded state proved highly agreeable and the first years of our marriage were fully as pleasant as i had expected we spent the winter in egypt excavating by day and sharing the delightful privacy of an otherwise unoccupied tomb by night and the summer in england with emersons brother walter a distinguished philologist and the husband of my dear friend evelyn it was a thoroughly satisfactory existence i cannot imagine why i who am normally as farsighted and practical as a woman can be did not realize that the matrimonial state quite often leads to another related state i refer of course to motherhood when the possibility of this interesting condition first manifested itself i was not excessively put out according to my calculations the child would be born in the summer enabling me to finish the seasons work and get the business over and done with before returning to the dig in the autumn this proved to be the case and we left the infant a boy named after his uncle walter in the care of that gentleman and his wife when we set out for egypt in october what ensued was not entirely the childs fault i had not anticipated that emersons next view of his son the following spring would induce a doting idiocy that manifested itself in baby talk and in a reluctance to be parted from the creature ramses as the child came to be called merited his nickname he was as imperious in his demands and as pervasive in his presence as that most arrogant of ancient egyptian godkings must have been he was also alarmingly precocious a lady of my acquaintance used that term to me after ramses aged four had treated her to a lecture on the proper method of excavating a compost heap hers in point of fact
