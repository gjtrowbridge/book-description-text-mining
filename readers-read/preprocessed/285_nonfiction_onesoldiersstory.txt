 chapter excerpt chapter one what a life he looked so young just a boy really not much more than twentyone years of age it wasnt fair that hed already experienced so much pain and misery in his short lifetime it wasnt right that his lofty hopes and dreams for the future had been snuffed out by one blast from an enemy explosive device but there he was in the intensive care unit at the walter reed army medical center in washington dc fighting for his life my wife elizabeth and i often visit wounded soldiers at walter reed but this occasion was different it was christmas day 2004 and i was about to be discharged from the hospital myself i had recently undergone surgery in new york and had been transferred to the medical center in washington to recuperate we were in the dining room shortly before two oclock visiting with several young soldiers who had been wounded in the iraq war when a mother and daughter spied us they approached us and introduced themselves as distant relatives of my family the mother then told us about her son craig nelson the young man in whose room i now stood my friend dr charles chuck peck had informed me of craigs presence in the hospital and i had hoped to see him before i left so the encounter seemed almost providential craig had been badly wounded while on patrol in iraq a week or so before christmas he suffered severe damage to his c1 vertebra and was paralyzed from his neck down now lying in an intensive care unit at walter reed he couldnt move a muscle he was hooked up to all sorts of medical machines with various tubes running to his body an electrocardiogram monitoring his heart a respirator helping him to breathe and a tracheotomy in his throat nevertheless the young mans eyes brightened as i stepped up to his bedside his mother introduced us craig this is bob dole craigs sister joined us around the bed craig couldnt speak but he could hear me and seemed to respond with his eyes looking at craig i felt a wave of emotion sweep over me nearly overwhelming me it was like seeing a mirror image of myself sixty years earlier he was tall and muscular about six feet one and a half inches and about 185 pounds almost identical to my world war ii height and weight for a moment i was back there in a similar hospital bed encased in plaster unable to move paralyzed from the neck down i just stood there at craigs bedside i could feel my heart thumping loudly in my chest my emotions rushing to the surface i knew the tough road craig had before him and his condition was far worse than mine had been i reached out my hand my left hand touched the soldiers arm and said good luck craig youre in a great hospital theyll take good care of you we stayed only about five minutes i looked the young man in the eyes one more time then turned to his mother put my arm around her shoulder and said well pray for craigs recovery please let me know if i can help unfortunately a few days later craig nelson another american hero passed away i grieved for that family and became more determined that this book would do something to help others understand their pain and the trauma that so many others have endured because of war ive seen these kids in the hospitals and out people who face seemingly impossible challenges and ive seen myself in them whatever reassurance hope and inspiration i can offer them comes out of my own life experiences its said often that my generation is the greatest generation thats not a title we claimed for ourselves truth be told we were ordinary americans fated to confront extraordinary tests every generation of young men and women who dare to face the realities of war fighting for freedom defending our country with a willingness to lay their lives on the line is the greatest generation in the end what gets people through a physical or emotional crisis is not new technology or medication those things can help of course but its faith that gives you the strength to endure faith that wont allow you to give up faith that manifests itself in a ferocious determination to take the next step the one that everyone else says is impossible adversity can be a harsh teacher but its lessons often define our lives as much as we may wish that we could go back and relive them do things differently make better wiser decisions we cant change history war is like that you can rewrite it attempt to infuse it with your own personal opinions twist or spin it to make it more palatable but eventually the truth will come out those pivotal moments remain indelibly impressed in your heart and mind for me the defining period in my life was not running for the highest office in the land it started years earlier in a foreign country where hardly anyone knew my name dear mom and dad what a life i can hardly believe that im living in such a wonderful place my rest is about over but ive really enjoyed myself so far im going on a tour this afternoon also one tomorrow morning i should see about
