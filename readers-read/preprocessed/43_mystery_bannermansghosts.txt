 1 from the site he had chosen the rebel commander could see sixty miles of coastline the place was angola on west africas coast its capital luanda lay below him beyond was the shimmer of the south atlantic ocean set ablaze as the sun neared the horizon the rebel commander was called alameo he was a tall man somewhat gaunt with an intelligent face whose normal expression was the hint of a smile but many days had passed since hed last smiled he was dressed in greenandbrown mottled fatigues that bore no insignia of rank his only distinguishing badge was his cap it was a frenchstyle kepi flat on top blue in color with fabric that draped to his shoulders he was known throughout angola by that cap he had chosen this site near the great waterfall because it was easily defended only two winding roads snaked their way up the bluffs that marked the beginning of the inland plateau each road had a number of hairpin turns all of which were within easy range of his mortars an attacking force on the ground would be slaughtered nor did he fear an attack from the air a canopy of forest protected his encampment from visual sightings by attack helicopters and they would be within range of his missilesnbsp but his mind on this day was not on defense when darkness fell he would descend the bluffs with only his captain and a few handpicked men the israelis his advisers had begged him not to risk it their leader named yoni said quotyoure not thinking straight we cant afford to lose you over thisquot alameo answered quothe tortured her yoniquot the israeli grimaced quotwe know what he didquot quothe cut sara to pieces he dismembered her yoni and he kept her alive until the last cut what she suffered was still on her facequot this last was not true thought the man known as yoni he had seen her face himself it was swollen but vacant she had indeed suffered greatly but her face gave little sign of it all they knew was that savran bobik had sara for what must have been three terrible days he then sent alameo what was left of her the israeli reached his hands to the taller mans shoulders quotalameo my friend you must listen to me i know that sara was special to you but she was one of us long before she met you i trained her myself and i loved her myself your claim is not greater than oursquot quotbobik sent her to me not to youquot the israeli said quotyes but we sent her to him do you think i dont wish we never asked her to do it i would give both my eyes to have her backquot quoti want bobiksquot the israeli gestured toward the city of luanda its lights had begun to blink on he said quotlet us do this for you we can move about freely were mossad but most of us have embassy status the worst they can do if were caught is expel us you they will shoot or much worsequotnbsp quotyou can have savran bobik when im finished with him i intend to have him for three daysquot the israeli gestured toward a nearer set of lights they came from a large biochemical complex surrounded by razorwire fencing it covered at least four kilometers square even so only part of the facility could be seen it was said to go four perhaps five stories down the main building bore the name vaalchem yoni asked quotis he there that place is guarded like a fort how can you hope to get out alivequot alameo shook his head quothe wont be at vaalchem not tonightquot quotthen wherequot quotat a warehouse that he uses hell be there in two hours hes preparing another of his shipments of death it will be his last that i promisequot quotyou are reliably informedquot he nodded quoti amquot quotby whom alameo who down there can you trust has it crossed your mind that this might be a trap that hes waiting for you that hes readyquot quotit has he thinks he is im not a stupid man yoniquot quotif you take himquot asked yoni quotwhat thenquot quoti told you three days he will answer for sara and bobik has much to tell us both about vaalchemquot quotwell do me one favor hold on to that thought savran bobik is a sadist and an allaround pig but vaalchem may have killed many hundreds to his one and theyve died just as horribly as saraquot quotnot the samequot said alameo quotthey all thought they were sick they werent strapped down while someone tore at their fleshquot a sigh quotokay agreed promise me ill get to question himquot quotyou can have him on the third dayquot 2 artemus bourne had been expecting the shipment but not for another few days at the least the three redandwhite containers resembling picnic coolers bore the logo of one of the companies he owned a biotech firm in west africa he would have winfields hide for this stupidity his instructions were explicit they had all been ignored the containers were to have been shipped most discreetly to another of his firms in virginia in plain language they were to be smuggled they were to have taken a circuitous route from angola to lisbon to grand cayman to virginia they were then to be driven to briarwood his estate unopened uninspected and untraceable and yet here they were expressed directly to his home not only with those logos announcing their source but with his name in bold letters emblazoned on the label and written in winfields own hand the writing seemed a bit shaky but definitely winfields the damned fool must have fallen off the wagon
