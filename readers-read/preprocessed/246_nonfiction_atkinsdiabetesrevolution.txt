its a frustrating fact of life we dont have much say over whether we fall victim to lifethreatening diseases such as cancer alzheimers or to a large extent some types of heart disease however there is one alltoocommon killer disease over which we have a great deal of say most people do have a choice when it comes to type 2 diabetes astonishing as it sounds this epidemic disease is almost entirely preventable of course no one consciously chooses to get diabetes various factorssome in our control and some notcombine to create the unfortunate scenario but if we all took proper care of our bodies and kept vigilant rein on the factors that are within our control there would be no diabetes epidemic do you think were overstating things no way in fact what we hope we have created with this book is a realistic and practical guide to wiping out type 2 diabetes one individual atatime according to the national institutes of health in 2002 a record number of americans 182 million or 63 percent of the population were thought to have diabetes of these 13 million were already diagnosed while 52 million probably have diabetes but havent been diagnosed yet that means many millions of americans are blindly chugging down this dangerous road sadly in our experience many wellmeaning health care professionals give their patients the standard information some of which perpetuates the very disease its supposed to cure or prevent thats why dr atkins felt it was crucial to write this book in 2002 and 2003 the american diabetes association redefined and standardized the criteria for blood sugar abnormalities unfortunately none of these changes were implemented in order to find patients earlier in the process our interest is in identifying patients with these metabolic problems long before they advance to the official blood sugar level defined as diabetes if you know what to look for you can identify the metabolic signposts that signal trouble even earlier in the process and intervene immediately if you are reading this book you are clearly concerned about your health or perhaps its someone you love about whom youre concerned either way congratulations to you for picking up this book lets not waste another minute we will show you how to make relatively simple lifestyle changes that can significantly reduce your risk of ever getting diabetes even if you already have some of the preliminary symptoms and if you have already been diagnosed with diabetes this book can help you mitigate its effects or maybe even stop further progression we can be your guides on the road to better health but it is you who must take control of your destiny by making and implementing the right choices imagine that you are standing at a crossroads in the map of your life ahead of you lie two paths one almost inevitably leads to diabetes and its accompanying health problems the other leads to optimal health which will you choose the right road let us tell you about the path that dr atkins recommended to his patients for decades it differs dramatically from the treatment with drugs most health care practitioners have been taught instead his path identifies risks for diabetes as early as possible focuses on prevention and involves permanent lifestyle changes to address the underlying metabolic problems that lead to diabetes these lifestyle changes can be as simple as changing what you put on your plate a better option we think youll agree than swallowing an array of expensive and potentially dangerous drugs those of you who have read dr atkins other books will recognize a point he hammered home for decades instead of treating the symptoms his approach can correct the problem itself finally for individuals whose blood sugar abnormalities are further advanced or who already have diabetes this path decreases or eliminates the need for drugs to treat these conditions did you know that some of these drugs actually make it harder to lose weight talk about a vicious cycle whether youre just beginning to be concerned about diabetes or youve already been handed the official diagnosis controlling carbohydrates is the vehicle that will take you off the rutted road of selfdestruction and onto the smooth one of recovery and excellent health the decision to improve your health is an obvious one but to follow this right road and stay on ityou need clear directions and
