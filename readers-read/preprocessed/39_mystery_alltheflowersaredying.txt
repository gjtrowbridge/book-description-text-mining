when i got there joe durkin was already holding down a corner table and working on a drink vodka on the rocks from the looks of it i took in the room and listened to the hum of conversation at the bar and i guess some of what i was feeling must have found its way to my face because the first thing joe asked me was if i was all right i said i was fine and why because you look like you saw a ghost he said be funny if i didnt i said the room is full of them a little new for ghosts isnt it how long have they been open two years closer to three time flies he said whether youre having fun or not jakes place whoever jake is you got a history with him i dont know who he is i had a history with the place before it was his jimmy armstrongs thats right he died didnt he was that before or after 911 thats our watershed everything in our lives is before or after that date after i said by five or six months he left the place to a nephew who tried running it for a few months and then decided it wasnt the life he wanted for himself so i guess he sold it to jake whoever jake is whoever jake is he said he puts a good meal on the table you know what theyve got here you can get an irish breakfast all day long whats that a cigarette and a sixpack very funny you must know what an irish breakfast is a sophisticated guy like yourself i nodded its the cardiac special right bacon and eggs and sausage and grilled tomato ah health food and black pudding he said which is hard to find you know what you want because ill have the irish breakfast i told the waitress id have the same and a cup of coffee joe said one vodka was enough but she could bring him a beer something irish to go with the breakfast but not guinness she suggested a harp and he said that would be fine ive known joe for twenty years though i dont know that ours is an intimate friendship hes spent those years as a detective at midtown north working out of the old stationhouse on west fiftyfourth street and wed developed a working relationship over time i went to him for favors and returned them sometimes in cash sometimes in kind now and then he steered a client my way there were times when our relations had been strained my close friendship with a career criminal never sat well with him while his attitude after one vodka too many didnt make me relish his company but wed been around long enough to know how to make it work overlooking what we didnt like to look at and staying close but not too close around the time our food arrived he told me hed put in his papers i said hed been threatening to do so for years and he said hed had everything filled out and ready to go a few years ago and then the towers came down that was no time to retire he said although guys did and how could you blame em they lost their heart for the job me id already lost my heart for it shoveling shit against the tide all we ever do right then though i managed to convince myself i was needed i can imagine so i stayed three years longer than i intended and if i did anything useful in those three years i cant remember what it was anyway im done todays what wednesday a week from fridays my last day so all i have to do now is figure out what the hell to do with the rest of my life which was why hed asked me to meet him for dinner in a room full of ghosts it had been over thirty years since i put in my papers and retired from the nypd and shortly thereafter id retired as well from my role as husband and father and moved from a comfortable suburban house in syosset to a monastic little room at the hotel northwestern i didnt spend much time in that room jimmy armstrongs saloon around the corner on ninth between fiftyseventh and fiftyeighth served as a combination of living room and office for me i met clients there i ate meals there and what social life i had was centered there i drank there too day in and day out because thats what i did back then i kept it up for as long as i could then i put the plug in the jug as the oldtimers say and began spending my idle hours not at jimmys joint but two blocks north of there in the basement of st paul the apostle and in other church basements and storefronts where i looked for something to put in the empty places alcohol used to fill somewhere along the way jimmy lost his lease and moved half a block south and a long block west to the corner of fiftyseventh and tenth id kept my distance from the old place after i sobered up and i avoided the new one for a while as well it never did become a hangout but elaine and i would drop in for a meal from time to time jimmy always served good food and the kitchen stayed open late which made it a good choice after an evening at the theater or lincoln center id been to the service at a funeral parlor on west fortyfourth where someone played a favorite song of his it was last call by dave van ronk and id first heard it when billie keegan played it for me after a long night of whiskey
