cancer the last words i ever thought id hear about myself were you have breast cancer it was as though someone had dropped a load of lead on my head i felt stunned this is something that happens to other people i thought not me i figured i am healthy i eat right i have exercised all my life my sister being diagnosed with breast cancer four years earlier was just a fluke i mean other than her there is no history of breast cancer in my family i reasoned how could this be happening every year since i turned forty i have been going to the usc norris comprehensive cancer center and hospital in los angeles i always looked forward to seeing my doctor mel silverstein who created the concept of the breast centers in this country he is a nice guy and has committed his life to the care of womens breasts my husband always jokingly tells him he is the luckiest guy around because he spends his days feeling womens bosoms it was time for my yearly mammogram and i had been religious about having annual checkups since i turned forty because i had been so diligent i cockily assumed that i was immune to the disease after all keeping such a vigilant check on my breasts would ensure that even if there was a problem we would find it before it ever had a chance to take hold the nurse pulled and squeezed flattened and pressed my poor aching breasts into positions no breast was meant to endure but it was for a good cause and all women know that the discomfort and humiliation are worth it in the long run because this examination is about life health and prevention well i dont see anything to worry about dr silverstein announced cheerily after looking at my mammogram i felt relieved even though i hadnt even considered the possibility now i could go on with my life for another year knowing i had beaten the statistics once again i went into the changing room and hurriedly put my clothes back on i had a busy day ahead of memeetings with the various vendors for my jewelry business the skin care line updates on the fitness business costume fittings and a band rehearsal to get ready for an upcoming date in las vegas the following week i was filled with energy and vitality suzanne i heard dr silverstein call through the changing room door yes i answered you know youve got such cystic breastslumps and bumps everywhere how about having an ultrasound for good measure i opened the door wondering why this would be necessary wasnt everything okay with my mammography i asked sure dr silverstein said goodnaturedly its just that we have this new stateoftheart ultrasound machine i just paid half a million dollars for it and what the heck lets take a look for good measure why not i reasoned i was there and it would only take another half hour surely i could fit this into my busy schedule my health was more important than anything i lay down on a stationary bed in the ultrasound room feeling no alarm since this was just for good measure the technician rubbed on some cold gooey liquid a conductive fluid and then began a gentle movement on my breasts with a wand about the size of a curling iron she kept rubbing back and forth for some time in one particular area on my upper right breast then she excused herself and said she would be back in a couple of moments i still felt no alarm i had been through these exams before often we found cysts that were filled with fluid which were then drained with a needle not the most pleasant experience but part of the routine i wasnt worried even when the technician returned with the radiologist to further probe my now rather sore and overworked breast i heard myself telling them not to worry i always have these cysts theyre just filled with fluid the tone in the room turned noticeably serious and i was at a loss as to why everyone seemed so intense we see something here we dont like so were going to stick a needle into it to see what we come up with frankly i felt relieved its the same old thing i thought ive had needles before i told her cheerfully well this is going to be a bit more uncomfortable than what you are used to we are using a bigger needle and i will try my best not to hurt you the doctor inserted the needle and this was indeed different it felt like a carving knife being plunged into my flesh yeow i said trying to stifle the fact that this hurt like hell youre going to feel a little pop like a cap gun going off inside of you she told me this way we can gather a piece of tissue for biopsy okay ready she asked pop wow it hurt a lot it felt more like a real gun going off in my breast then i felt the needle ripping through my breast while the doctor pulled with all her strength to get the needle out oh my god i blurted out that is painful i know im sorry she said unfortunately we are going to have to do this several more times several insertions later we were finished the pain was unbelievable my breasts felt like punching bags okay at least now weve done it and i can get on with my day i thought as i dressed i decided to tell dr silverstein that he should have prepared me for the pain a little better in fact after all the pulling and probing i wasnt feeling very cheery and in thinking about it i felt a little angry that dr silverstein had downplayed the hurt quotient carefully i pulled on my jacket which was no easy feat because of the pain in my breast and then opened the door of the changing room standing in the hallway just outside were dr silverstein the radiologist and the nurse all with serious looks on their faces dr silverstein took my hand sensitively and said we hope you will be okay what i asked bewildered it doesnt look good dr silverstein said what do you mean i asked i could feel my heart pounding of course were waiting for the pathology report to come back in a few hours dr silverstein explained but from what i can see i think we should make plans for surgery i experienced the next hours as though i were under water i heard and saw everything but it was filtered distant i was in shock so many decisions had to be made they had found a malignant tumor 24 centimeters in size it was lodged deep in my chest and had not been detected the doctors thought it had been growing for approximately ten years how could the mammogram have missed something so large i kept asking myself cancer is lonely the decisions to be made are too serious and too monumental to be passed on to anyone these were decisions i had to make it was unfair of me even to ask alan my husband what he thought i should do luckily we had caught it soon enough so it didnt look as though they would have to perform a mastectomy they would remove the tumor and some lymph nodes from under my arm if the margins were clean they would not have to remove the breast i never thought that i would have my own cancer doctor but now i had an oncologist dr waisman i liked him he was wise sensitive and smart i was still in a daze only this morning i had been getting ready to go to las vegas in a week with my show and now it all seemed insignificant and unimportant alan and i sat in the waiting room not knowing how to feel i kept thinking one day life is perfect the next day its as if all the balls have been thrown into the air and you have no idea where they will land id never given dying any thought its what happens somewhere down the line a long time from now for the first time in my life i was faced with the possibility of my own mortality we drove home in a stunned silence alan and i walked on the beach for a long time our arms were wrapped around each other giving support we were in this together i couldnt think i was being asked by so many what i wanted to do but i couldnt give them any answers i didnt know the following morning i awakened from what seemed to be a nightmare and suddenly i knew i had to take charge it was my body and i wanted to be in charge i called my endocrinologist and dear friend dr diana schwarzbein to fill her in on my condition this was war i began a visualization of my tumor inside the tumor i saw this cowardly creepy person hiding every time i saw him even try to step out of the encapsulated tumor i would yell in my mind with all the venom i could muster dont even try to leave this tumor or ill fucking kill you then i visualized the cowardly little cancer cells shrink with fear and step back inside the tumor i know it sounds weird but at that moment i didnt know how to keep the cancer at bay and this was the only way i could feel that i had any control over it next i started making phone calls my agent al lowman said you should talk to selma schimmel whos that i asked shes one of my authors who has written a lot about breast cancer selma told me about dr avrum bluming who was doing research with women and breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy hrt albeit with synthetic hormones i did not want to give up my hormones as you will find out in the next few chapters i have expended a great deal of effort getting my chemicals balanced and learning about natural hormones now upon diagnosis i was being told that hormones had to be stopped because of my breast cancer i knew what that meant relative to the quality of my life and i was not about to go back to feeling the way i had before i got my hormones balanced i started to gather doctors dr waisman came highly recommended but i wanted other opinions i told dr waisman about dr bluming and he said that not only did he know him but he was working with him on a study of the connection between women with breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy okay this is good i thought i was on the phone constantly cancer is like a job the treatments are inexact there is the common course of treatment but so far everything i was being told about the common course was not appealing to me i knew of too many people who were on the chemotherapy merrygoround chemo seems to make people in treatment more ill and frankly it scared me to death i was afraid of what it would do to the good cells and i cant say that i wasnt more than a little afraid of the harshness of the treatment first theres the hair loss and then the sickly color the complexion takes on then theres the damage done to the parts of the body that until this time were functioning properly the idea of ingesting potent chemicals was abhorrent and frightening to me i am against putting chemicals into the body unless absolutely necessary and i wanted to be sure that this was the only option before i took on something so radical then it was suggested that after surgery i would take the drug tamoxifen for the next five years as a preventative the only problem i found in doing my research was that this drug would probably make me depressed for much of the duration plus there was a 40 percent increased risk of heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism all this for only a 10 percent greater chance that the cancer would not recur didnt sound like very good odds to me i felt weary so much information to gather so much authority to weigh it would be easier to just sit back and let all of them handle it for me that is what i would have done in my younger years i would have assumed that they knew better i would have followed the common course but things were different now i was a grownup and the privilege that comes with having lived this long is the realization that no one knows better than i what i want to do with my body i have worked too hard all my life to undo the damage of my childhood to get out from under the grip of having been raised by an abusive alcoholic to make something of my life to raise a child on my own to endure the pain of blending families to see my career knocked out from under me in a war of egos only to come out the loser in the whole deal i could not have known that those earlier ordeals would give me the strength to fight this giant war now raging inside my body the big revelation that comes with maturity is that life is a series of highs and lows and its during the low points of life that you have breakthroughs through the negatives we are given the opportunities to have that aha moment where we figure out what we dont want in our lives i didnt want to live my life as a victim i didnt want to use the excuse that i coulda or shoulda or woulda had a great life but i had some bad luck it has always been the bad luck or the negatives in my life that have taught me and shaped me and i wasnt going to lose this time around cancer was going to be my blessing i was going to learn and grow and survive my way
