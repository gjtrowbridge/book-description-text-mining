 1 8220 naked naked i don8217t have any clothes so so cold 8221 8220who is this8221 i asked 8220so cold8221 the voice said again 8220who is this8221 8220 cold and naked sleeping in the trees8221 he hung up then it was the fourth evening in a week that he8217d called the first night he only grunted and moaned two days later he spoke in single words those words were cold and naked the voice was definitely masculine but strained and frightened the next night he used the same two words but he doubled up on them from time to time saying naked cold cold naked he was pleading but i didn8217t know what he wanted he didn8217t seem threatening just desperate and crazed when i told nella about it she said that i should call the police 8220there8217s no telling what psychotic notions he might have in his head8221 the buttercreamcolored dreadlockwearing ceramicist warned 8220he might be working up to coming in there and slaughtering you and everybody in your whole house8221 8220he doesn8217t even know my name8221 i said 8220he knows your number8221 the lovely young jamaican reasoned 8220he probably dialed it once and now it8217s on his redial or something8221 8220better be safe8221 nella said 8220than dead8221 i wasn8217t worried about a few crank calls in my head i had worked out that the poor guy was already in a mental institution that he was on the honor plan or something like that at night he got confused and hallucinated that he was naked and cold living in the woods that8217s how it was with my grandmother before she died during the day she was perfectly lucid talking about old times in atlanta before she and my grandfather moved to los angeles she had all kinds of great stories about her wild days as a young girl and then after she was married about her friends in the church choir she was also a member of the southern christian leadership conference 8220back then martin luther king stood down the whole old boy system8212and beat 8217em too8221 grandma angeline used to say those talks were during the day but after the sun set she experienced night terrors her husband returned from the grave and blamed her for poisoning him she would run away from the assistedliving home and wander pico boulevard in los angeles looking for the bus to peachtree street in downtown atlanta sometimes she bullied older male patients in the residence taking their desserts or pushing them down when their backs were turned for years the administrators were on the verge of moving my grandmother to a facility that offered more restrictive care then i would go in and talk with her about members of our family whom i8217d never met about whom my father never spoke there was albert trellmore for instance the bookkeeper and arsonist every fourth of july he set fire to one of the big corporations or production companies around georgia he loved fires and hated what big businesses did to the poor 8220he burnt lumber companies banks loadin8217 dock warehouses and big department stores for over twentyseven years8221 my grandma angeline told me one gray june day we were sitting on the first floor of the residence near a glass wall that looked out on pico 8220he woulda kept it up for twentyseven more if it wasn8217t for that trainyard fire he set8221 8220what happened then grandma8221 8220he didn8217t think that some8217a the hoboes might have been sleepin8217 under the depot one of them men died and it broke albert8217s heart he never set another fire and died just two years later8221 8220why8217d he set those fires in the first place8221 i asked my eightyeightyearold gram 8220white people8221 she said 8220some of 8217em used to refuse to hire black some would abuse the ones they had workin8217 for 8217em now and then there was a klansman had all his money wrapped up in one8217a them places8221 8220but why do it on the fourth of july8221 8220called it his patriotic duty8221 she said and we both got a big laugh out of it after one of my visits grandma angeline would calm down during the evenings for a few weeks we wouldn8217t get any complaints at all from the residence i liked visiting my grandmother my father when he was still alive never wanted to talk about the old days down south he rarely visited his mother because she insisted in talking about all that old shit as he used to say but i liked her stories and i didn8217t care if she went crazy at night and wandered the streets of la looking for atlanta landmarks my mother was from an orange county wasp family that didn8217t have many good stories she cooked the meals and made sure that my sister and i were healthy but she didn8217t know how to have fun8212at least that8217s what i thought and so when the crazy man who was naked and cold and living in the trees called i had a soft spot for him like i did for my grandmother and my cousin albert trellmore that night i dreamed about my father he was emaciated as he had been during the last months of his cancer he had sunken black cheeks and big eyes that seemed to belong to an inquisitive infant rather than a sixtyyearold man in his last days he insisted on sitting up and then standing to greet me every morning when i came over to see him he8217d always utter some word that would speak a whole volume in our personal history 8220kangol8221 he said on the last morning i saw him we both loved those hats actually i didn8217t care much about them but i wore one because my father had bought it for me i made up my mind to go out and buy him a blue kangol and to bring it as a surprise the next day i had to go to three different department stores before i found the right one but when i brought it to my parents8217 apartment the next morning they were gone their absence could only have meant that my father had died in the night i sat at the kitchen table until my mother returned she told me that everything was better now because at least he was no longer in pain in the dream he was just as skinny and still on his deathbed but he was flexing his muscles and sitting up against a pile of pillows 8220how are you dad8221 8220much better errol i8217m doing those exercises the nurse gave me she said if i keep it up i8217ll beat this cancer in three months8221 an elation spread through me that was so powerful i woke up rising out of the bed i paced around the onetime garage that was now my home hoping to find some clue to the dream in my waking world
