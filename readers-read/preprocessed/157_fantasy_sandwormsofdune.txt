 so many people i knew in the past are not yet reborn i still miss them even though i do not remember them the axlotl tanks will soon remedy that nbsp lady jessica nbsp the ghola nbsp aboard the wandering noship ithaca jessica witnessed the birth of her daughter but only as an observer just fourteen years old she and many others crowded the medical center while two bene gesserit suk doctors in the adjacent creche prepared to extract the tiny girl child from an axlotl tank nbsp alia one of the female doctors murmured nbsp this was not truly jessicas daughter but a ghola grown from preserved cells none of the young gholas on the noship were themselves yet they had regained none of their memories none of their pasts nbsp something tried to surface at the back of her mind and though she worried at it like a loose tooth jessica could not remember the first time alia had been born in the archives she had read and reread the legendary accounts generated by muaddibs biographers but she couldnt remember nbsp all she had were images from her studies a dry and dusty sietch on arrakis surrounded by fremen jessica and her son paul had been on the run taken in by the desert tribe duke leto was dead murdered by harkonnens pregnant jessica had drunk the water of life forever changing the fetus inside her from the moment of her birth the original alia had been different from all other babies filled with ancient wisdom and madness able to tap into other memory without having gone through the spice agony abomination nbsp that had been another alia another time and another way nbsp now jessica stood beside her ghola son paul who was chronologically a year older than she paul waited with his beloved fremen mate chani and the nineyearold ghola of a boy who had in turn been their son leto ii in a prior shuffle of lives this had been jessicas family nbsp the bene gesserit order had resurrected these figures from history to help fight against the terrible outside enemy that hunted them they had thufir hawat the planetologist lietkynes the fremen leader stilgar and even the notorious dr yueh now after almost a decade of hiatus in the ghola program alia had joined the group others would come soon the three remaining axlotl tanks were already pregnant with new children gurney halleck serena butler xavier harkonnen nbsp duncan idaho gave jessica a quizzical look eternal duncan with all of his memories restored from all of his prior lives she wondered what he thought of this new ghola baby a bubble of the past rising up to the present long ago the first ghola of duncan had been alias consort nbsp nbsp nbsp concealing his age well duncan was a fullgrown man with dark wiry hair he looked exactly like the hero shown in so many archival records from the time of muaddib through the god emperors thirtyfivecentury reign to now another fifteen centuries later nbsp breathless and late the old rabbi bustled into the birthing chamber accompanied by twelveyearold wellington yueh young yuehs forehead did not bear the diamond tattoo of the famous suk school the bearded rabbi seemed to think he could save the gangly young man from repeating the terrible crimes he had committed in his prior life nbsp at the moment the rabbi looked angry as he invariably did whenever he came near the axlotl tanks since the bene gesserit doctors ignored him the old man vented his displeasure on sheeana after years of sanity you have done it again when will you learn to stop taunting god nbsp after receiving an ominous prescient dream sheeana had declared a temporary moratorium on the ghola project that had been her passion from its inception but their recent ordeal on the planet of the handlers and their near capture by the enemy hunters had forced sheeana to reassess that decision the wealth of historical and tactical experience the reawakened gholas could offer might be the greatest weapon the noship possessed sheeana had decided to take the risk nbsp perhaps we will be saved by alia one day jessica thought or by one of the other gholas nbsp tempting fate sheeana had performed an experiment on this unborn ghola in an effort to make it more like the alia estimating the point in the pregnancy when the original jessica had consumed the water of life sheeana had instructed bene gesserit suk doctors to flood the axlotl tank with a nearfatal spice overdose saturating the fetus trying to recreate an abomination nbsp jessica had been horrified to learn of ittoo late when she could do nothing about it how would the spice affect that innocent baby a melange overdose was different from undergoing the agony nbsp one of the suk doctors told the rabbi to stay out of the birthing creche scowling the old man held up a trembling hand as if making a blessing on the pale flesh of the axlotl tank you witches think these tanks are no longer women no longer humanbut this is still rebecca she remains a child of my flock nbsp rebecca fulfilled a vital need sheeana said all of the volunteers knew exactly what they were doing she accepted her responsibility why cant you nbsp the rabbi turned in exasperation toward the young man at his side speak to them yueh maybe they will listen to you nbsp jessica thought the sallow young ghola seemed more intrigued than incensed about the tanks as a suk doctor he said i delivered many children but never like this at least i dont think so with my ghola memories still locked away i get confused sometimes nbsp and rebecca is humannot just some biological machine to produce melange and a brood of gholas you have to see that the rabbis voice grew in volume nbsp yueh shrugged because i was born in the same fashion i cannot be entirely objective if my memories were restored maybe id agree with you nbsp you dont need original memories to think you can think cant you nbsp the baby is ready one of the doctors interrupted we must decant it now she turned impatiently to the rabbi let us do our workor the tank could be harmed as well nbsp with a sound of disgust the rabbi shouldered his way from the birthing creche yueh remained behind continuing to watch nbsp one of the suk women tied off the umbilical cord from the fleshy tank her shorter colleague cut the purplishred whip then she wiped off the slick infant and lifted little alia into the air the child let out a loud and immediate cry as if she had been impatient to be born jessica sighed in relief at the healthy sound which told her the girl was not an abomination this time the original newborn alia had purportedly looked upon the world with the eyes and intelligence of a full adult this babys crying sounded normal but it stopped abruptly nbsp while one doctor tended the nowsagging axlotl tank the other dried the infant and wrapped her in a blanket unable to help feeling a tug at her heart jessica wanted to reach out and hold the baby but resisted the urge would alia suddenly start speaking uttering voices from other memory instead the baby looked around the medical center without seeming to focus nbsp others would care for alia not unlike the way bene gesserit sisters took baby girls under their collective wing the first jessica born under the close scrutiny of breeding mistresses had never known a mother in the traditional sense nor would this jessica nor alia nor any of the other experimental ghola babies the new daughter would be raised communally in an improvised society more an object of scientific curiosity than love nbsp what an odd family we all are jessica whispered nbsp humans are never capable of complete accuracy despite all the knowledge and experiences we have absorbed from countless face dancer ambassadors we are left with a confused picture nonetheless the flawed accounts of human history provide amusing insights into the delusions of mankind nbsp erasmus nbsp records and analyses backup 242 nbsp in spite of a decadeslong effort the thinking machines had not yet captured the noship and its precious cargo that did not however stop the computer evermind from launching his vast extermination fleet against the rest of humanity nbsp duncan idaho continued to elude omnius and erasmus who repeatedly cast their sparkling tachyon net into the nothingness searching for their quarry the noships veiling capability normally prevented it from being seen but from time to time the pursuers caught glimpses as of something concealed behind shrubbery at first the hunt had been a challenge but now the evermind was growing frustrated nbsp you have lost the ship again omnius boomed through wall speakers in the central cathedrallike chamber in the technological metropolis of synchrony nbsp inaccurate i must first find it before i can lose it erasmus tried to sound carefree as he shifted his flowmetal skin reverting from his guise as a kindly old woman to the more familiar appearance of a platinumsurfaced robot nbsp like overarching tree trunks metal spires towered above erasmus to form a vaulted dome within the machine cathedral photons glittered from the activated skins of the pillars bathing his new laboratory in light he had even installed a glowing fountain that bubbled with lavaa useless decoration but the robot often indulged his carefully cultivated artistic sensibilities do not be impatient remember the mathematical projections everything is nicely predetermined nbsp your mathematical projections could be myths like any prophecy how do i know they are correct nbsp because i have said they are correct nbsp with the launch of the machine fleet the longforetold kralizec had begun at last kralizec armageddon the battle at the end of the universe ragnarok azrafel the end times the cloud darkness it was a time of fundamental change of the entire universe shifting on its cosmic axis human legends had predicted such a cataclysmic event since the dawn of civilization indeed they had already been through several iterations of similar cataclysms the butlerian jihad itself the jihad of paul muaddib the reign of the tyrant leto ii by manipulating computer projections and thus creating expectations in the mind of omnius erasmus had succeeded in initiating the events that would bring about another fundamental shift prophecy and realitythe order of things really didnt matter nbsp like an arrow all of erasmuss infinitely complex calculations running trillions of data points through the most sophisticated routines pointed to one result the final kwisatz haderachwhoever that waswould determine the course of events at the end of kralizec the projection also revealed that the kwisatz haderach was on the noship so omnius naturally wanted such a force fighting on his side ergo the thinking machines needed to capture that ship the first to exert control over the final kwisatz haderach would win nbsp erasmus didnt fully understand exactly what the superhuman might do when he was located and seized though the robot was a longtime student of mankind he was still a thinking machine while the kwisatz haderach was not the new face dancers who had long infiltrated humanity and brought vital information back to the synchronized empire fell somewhere in between like hybrid biological machines he and omnius had both absorbed so many of the lives stolen by the face dancers that sometimes they forgot who they were the original tleilaxu masters had not foreseen the significance of what they had helped create nbsp the independent robot knew he still had to keep omnius under control though we have time you have a galaxy to conquer before we need the kwisatz haderach aboard that ship nbsp i am glad i did not wait for you to succeed nbsp for centuries omnius had been building his invincible force using traditional but supremely efficient lightspeed engines the millions and millions of machine vessels now swept forward and spread out conquering one star system at a time the evermind could have made use of the surrogate mathematical navigation systems which his face dancers had given to the spacing guild but one element of the holtzman technology simply remained too incomprehensible something indefinably human was required to travel through foldspace an intangible leap of faith the evermind would never admit that the bizarre technology actually made him nervous
