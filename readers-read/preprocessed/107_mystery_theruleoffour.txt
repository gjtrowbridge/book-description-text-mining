 chapter 1 strange thing time it weighs most on those who have it least nothing is lighter than being young with the world on your shoulders it gives you a feeling of possibility so seductive you know there must be something more important you could be doing than studying for exams i can see myself now the night it all began im lying back on the old red sofa in our dorm room wrestling with pavlov and his dogs in my introductory psychology book wondering why i never fulfilled my science requirement as a freshman like everyone else a pair of letters sits on the coffee table in front of me each containing a vision of what i could be doing next year the night of good friday has fallen cold april in princeton new jersey and with only a month of college left im no different from anyone else in the class of 1999 im having trouble getting my mind off the future charlie is sitting on the floor by the cube refrigerator playing with the magnetic shakespeare someone left in our room last week the fitzgerald novel hes supposed to be reading for his final paper in english 151w is spread open on the floor with its spine broken like a butterfly somebody stepped on and hes forming and reforming sentences from magnets with shakespearean words on them if you ask him why hes not reading fitzgerald hell grunt and say theres no point as far as hes concerned literature is just an educated mans shell game threecard monte for the college crowd what you see is never what you get for a scienceminded guy like charlie thats the height of perversity hes headed for medical school in the fall but the rest of us are still hearing about the cplus he found on his english midterm in march gil glances over at us and smiles hes been pretending to study for an economics exam but breakfast at tiffanys is on and gil has a thing for old films especially ones with audrey hepburn his advice to charlie was simple if you dont want to read the book then rent the movie theyll never know hes probably right but charlie sees something dishonest in that and anyway it would prevent him from complaining about what a scam literature is so instead of daisy buchanan were watching holly golightly yet again i reach down and rearrange some of charlies words until the sentence at the top of the fridge says to fail or not to fail that is the question charlie raises his head to give me a disapproving look sitting down hes almost as tall as i am on the couch when we stand next to each other he looks like othello on steroids a twohundredandfifteenpound black man who scrapes the ceilings at sixandahalf feet by contrast im fivefootseven in shoes charlie likes to call us red giant and white dwarf because a red giant is a star thats unusually large and bright while a white dwarf is small and dense and dull i have to remind him that napoleon was only fivefoottwo even if paul is right that when you convert french feet to english the emperor was actually taller paul is the only one of us who isnt in the room now he disappeared earlier in the day and hasnt been seen since things between him and me have been rocky for the past month and with all the academic pressure on him lately hes chosen to do most of his studying at ivy the eating club where he and gil are members its his senior thesis hes working on the paper all princeton undergrads must write in order to graduate charlie gil and i would be doing the same ourselves except that our departmental deadlines have already come and gone charlie identified a new protein interaction in certain neuronal signaling pathways gil managed something on the ramifications of a flat tax i pasted mine together at the last minute between applications and interviews and im sure frankenstein scholarship will forever be the same the senior thesis is an institution that almost everyone despises alumni talk about their theses wistfully as if they cant remember anything more enjoyable than writing onehundredpage research papers while taking classes and choosing their professional futures in reality a senior thesis is a miserable spinebreaking thing to write its an introduction to adult life a sociology professor told charlie and me once in that annoying way professors have of lecturing after the lecture is over its about shouldering something so big you cant get out from under it its called responsibility he said try it on for size never mind that the only thing he was trying on for size was a pretty thesis advisee named kim silverman it was all about responsibility id have to agree with what charlie said at the time if kim silverman is the sort of thing adults cant get out from under then sign me up otherwise ill take my chances being young paul is the last of us to finish his thesis and theres no question that his will be the best of the bunch in fact his may be the best of our entire graduating class in the history department or any other the magic of pauls intelligence is that he has more patience than anyone ive ever met and with it he simply wears problems down to count a hundred million stars he told me once at the rate of one per second sounds like a job that no one could possibly complete in a lifetime in reality it would only take three years the key is focus a willingness not to be distracted and that is pauls gift an intuition of just how much a person can do slowly maybe thats why everyone has such high expectations for his thesisthey know how many stars he could count in three years but hes been working on his thesis for almost four while the average student comes up with a research topic in the fall of senior year and finishes it by the next spring paul has been struggling with his since freshman year just a few months into our first fall semester he decided to focus on a rare renaissance text entitled hypnerotomachia poliphili a labyrinthine name i can pronounce only because my father spent most of his career as a renaissance historian studying it three and a half years later and barely twentyfour hours from his deadline paul has enough material to make even the most discriminating graduate programs salivate the problem is he thinks i ought to be enjoying the fanfare too we worked on the book together for a few months during the winter and made good progress as a team only then did i understand something my mother used to say that men in our family had a tendency to fall for certain books about as hard as they fell for certain women the hypnerotomachia may never have had much outward charm but it has an ugly womans wiles the slow addictive tug of inner mystery when i caught myself slipping into it the same way my father had i managed to pull myself out and throw in the towel before it could ruin my relationship with a girlfriend who deserved better since then things between paul and me havent been the same a graduate student he knows bill stein has helped with his research since i begged off now as his thesis deadline approaches paul has become strangely guarded hes usually much more forthcoming about his work but over the past week hes withdrawn not only from me but from charlie and gil too refusing to speak a word of his research to anyone quotso which way are you leaning tomquot gil asks charlie glances up from the fridge quotyeahquot he says quotwere all on tenterhooksquot gil and i groan tenterhooks is one of the words charlie missed on his midterm he attributed it to mobydick instead of tobias smolletts adventures of roderick random on the grounds that it sounded more like a kind of fishing lure than a word for suspense now he wont let it go quotget over itquot gil says quotname me one doctor who knows what a tenterhook isquot charlie says before either of us can answer a rustling sound comes from inside the bedroom i share with paul suddenly standing before us at the door wearing only boxers and a tshirt is paul himself quotjust onequot he asks rubbing his eyes quottobias smollett he was a surgeonquot charlie glances back at the magnets quotfiguresquot gil chuckles but says nothing quotwe thought you went to ivyquot charlie says when the pause becomes noticeable paul shakes his head backtracking into his room to pick up his notebook his strawcolored hair is pressed flat on one side and there are pillow creases on his face quotnot enough privacyquot he says quotive been working in my bunk again fell asleepquot hes hardly gotten a wink in two nights maybe more pauls advisor dr vincent taft has pressed him to produce more and more documentation every weekand unlike most advisors who are happy to let seniors hang by the rope of their own expectations taft has kept a hand at pauls back from the start quotso what about it tomquot gil asks filling the silence quotwhats your decisionquot i glance up at the table hes talking about the letters in front of me which ive been eyeing between each sentence in my book the first letter is from the university of chicago offering me admission to a doctoral program in english books are in my blood the same way medical school is in charlies and a phd from chicago would suit me just fine i did have to scrap for the acceptance letter a little more than i wanted to partly because my grades at princeton have been middling but mainly because i dont know exactly what i want to do with myself and a good graduate program can smell indecision like a dog can smell fear quottake the moneyquot gil says never taking his eyes off audrey hepburn gil is a bankers son from manhattan princeton has never been a destination for him just a window seat with a view a stopover on the way to wall street he is a caricature of himself in that respect and he manages a smile whenever we give him a hard time about it hell be smiling all the way to the bank we know even charlie whos sure to make a small fortune as a doctor wont hold a candle to the kind of paychecks gil will see quotdont listen to himquot paul says from the other side of the room quotfollow your heartquot i look up surprised that hes aware of anything but his thesis quotfollow the moneyquot gil says standing up to get a bottle of water from the refrigerator quotwhatd they offerquot charlie asks ignoring the magnets for a second quotfortyonequot gil guesses and a few elizabethan words tumble from the fridge as he closes it quotbonus of five plus optionsquot spring semester is job season and 1999 is a buyers market fortyone thousand dollars a year is roughly double what i expected to be earning with my lowly english degree but compared to some of the deals ive seen classmates make youd think it was barely getting by i pick up the letter from daedalus an internet firm in austin that claims to have developed the worlds most advanced software for streamlining the corporate back office i know almost nothing about the company let alone what a back office is but a friend down the hall suggested i interview with them and as rumors circulated about high starting salaries at this unknown texas startup i went daedalus following the general trend didnt care that i knew nothing about them or their business if i could just solve a few brainteasers at an interview and seem reasonably articulate and friendly in the process the job was mine thus in good caesarian fashion i could i did and it was quotclosequot i say reading from the letter quotfortythree thousand a year signing bonus of three thousand fifteen hundred optionsquot quotand a partridge in a pear treequot paul adds from across the room hes the only one acting like its dirtier to talk about money than it is to touch it quotvanity of vanitiesquot charlie is shifting the magnets again in a fulminating baritone he imitates the preacher at his church a tiny black man from georgia who just finished his degree at the princeton theological seminary quotvanity of vanities all is vanitiesquot quotbe honest with yourself tomquot paul says impatiently though he never makes eye contact quotany company that thinks you deserve a salary like that isnt going to be around for long you dont even know what they doquot he returns to his notebook scribbling away like most prophets he is fated to be ignored gil keeps his focus on the television but charlie looks up hearing the edge in pauls voice he rubs a hand along the stubble on his chin then says quotall right everybody stop i think its time to let off some steamquot for the first time gil turns away from the movie he must hear what i hear the faint emphasis on the word steam quotright nowquot i ask gil looks at his watch taking to the idea quotwed be clear for about half an hourquot he says and in a show of support he even turns off the television letting audrey fizzle into the tube charlie flips his fitzgerald shut mischief stirring the broken spine springs open in protest but he tosses the book onto the couch quotim workingquot paul objects quoti need to finish thisquot he glances at me oddly quotwhatquot i ask but paul remains silent quotwhats the problem girlsquot charlie says impatiently quotits still snowing out therequot i remind everyone the first snowstorm of the year came howling into town today just when spring seemed perched on the tip of every tree branch now there are calls for a foot of accumulation maybe more the easter weekend festivities on campus which this year include a good friday lecture by pauls thesis advisor vincent taft have been reorganized this is hardly the weather for what charlie has in mind quotyou dont have to meet curry until 830 rightquot gil asks paul trying to convince him quotwell be done by then you can work more tonightquot richard curry an eccentric former friend of my fathers and tafts has been a mentor of pauls since freshman year he has put paul in touch with some of the most prominent art historians in the world and has funded much of pauls research on the hypnerotomachia paul weighs his notebook in his hand just looking at it the fatigue returns to his eyes
