 a boy at the window for a long time after that summer the four penderwick sisters still talked of arundel fate drove us there jane would say no it was the greedy landlord who sold our vacation house on cape cod someone else would say probably skye who knew which was right but it was true that the beach house they usually rented had been sold at the last minute and the penderwicks were suddenly without summer plans mr penderwick called everywhere but cape cod was booked solid and his daughters were starting to think they would be spending their whole vacation at home in cameron massachusetts not that they didnt love cameron but what is summer without a trip to somewhere special then out of the blue mr penderwick heard through a friend of a friend about a cottage in the berkshire mountains it had plenty of bedrooms and a big fencedin pen for a dogperfect for big black clumsy lovable hound penderwickand it was available to be rented for three weeks in august mr penderwick snatched it up sight unseen he didnt know what he was getting us into batty would say rosalind always said its too bad mommy never saw arundelshe would have loved the gardens and jane would say there are much better gardens in heaven and mommy will never have to bump into mrs tifton in heaven skye added to make her sisters laugh and laugh they would and the talk would move on to other things until the next time someone remembered arundel but all that is in the future when our story begins batty is still only four years old rosalind is twelve skye eleven and jane ten theyre in their car with mr penderwick and hound the family is on the way to arundel and unfortunately theyre lost quotits battys faultquot said skye quotit is notquot said batty quotof course it isquot said skye quotwe wouldnt be lost if hound hadnt eaten the map and hound wouldnt have eaten the map if you hadnt hidden your sandwich in itquot quotmaybe its fate that hound ate the map maybe well discover something wonderful while were lostquot said jane quotwell discover that when im in the backseat for too long with my younger sisters i go insane and murder themquot said skye quotsteady troopsquot said mr penderwick quotrosalind how about a gamequot quotlets do i went to the zoo and i sawquot said rosalind quoti went to the zoo and i saw an anteater janequot quoti went to the zoo and i saw an anteater and a buffaloquot said jane batty was between jane and skye so it was her turn next quoti went to the zoo and i saw an anteater a buffalo and a cangarooquot quotkangaroo starts with a k not a cquot said skye quotit does not it starts with a c like catquot said batty quotjust take your turn skyequot said rosalind quottheres no point in playing if we dont do it rightquot rosalind who was sitting in the front seat with mr penderwick turned around and gave skye her oldestsister glare it wouldnt do much rosalind knew after all skye was only one year younger than she was but it might quiet her long enough for rosalind to concentrate on where they were going they really were badly lost this trip should have taken an hour and a half and already theyd been on the road for three rosalind looked over at her father in the drivers seat his glasses were slipping down his nose and he was humming his favorite beethoven symphony the one about spring rosalind knew this meant he was thinking about plantshe was a professor of botanyinstead of about his driving quotdaddyquot she said quotwhat do you remember about the mapquot quotwere supposed to go past a little town called framley then make a few turns and look for number eleven stafford streetquot quotdidnt we see framley a while ago and lookquot she said pointing out the window quotweve been past those cows beforequot quotgood eyes rosyquot he said quotbut werent we going in the other direction last time maybe this way will do the trickquot quotno because all we saw along here were more cow fields rememberquot quotoh yesquot mr penderwick stopped the car turned it around and went back the other way quotwe need to find someone who can give us directionsquot said rosalind quotwe need to find a helicopter that can airlift us out of herequot said skye quotand keep your stupid wings to yourselfquot she was talking to batty who as always was wearing her beloved orangeandblack butterfly wings quottheyre not stupidquot said batty quotwoofquot said hound from his place among the boxes and suitcases in the very back of the car he took battys side in every discussion quotlost and weary the brave explorers and their faithful beast argued among themselves only sabrina starr remained calmquot said jane sabrina starr was the heroine of books that jane wrote she rescued things in the first book it was a cricket then came sabrina starr rescues a baby sparrow sabrina starr rescues a turtle and most recently sabrina starr rescues a groundhog rosalind knew that jane was looking for ideas on what sabrina should rescue next skye had suggested a maneating crocodile who would devour the heroine and put an end to the series but the rest of the family had shouted her down they enjoyed janes books there was a loud oomph in the backseat rosalind glanced around to make sure violence hadnt broken out but it was only batty struggling with her car seatshe was trying to twist herself backward to see hound jane was jotting in her favorite blue notebook so they were both all right but skye was blowing out her cheeks and imitating a fish which meant she was even more bored than rosalind had feared theyd better find this cottage soon then rosalind spotted the truck pulled over by the side of the road quotstop daddy maybe we can get directionsquot mr penderwick pulled over and rosalind got out of the car she now saw that the truck had tomatoes painted in large letters on each of its doors next to the truck was a wooden table piled high with fat red tomatoes and behind the table an old man wearing worn blue jeans and a green shirt with harrys tomatoes embroidered across the pocket quottomatoesquot he asked quotask if theyre magic tomatoesquot rosalind heard out of the corner of her eye she saw skye hauling jane back in through the car window quotmy younger sistersquot said rosalind apologetically to the old man quothad six of em myselfquot rosalind tried to imagine having six younger sisters but she kept coming up with each of her sisters turned into twins she shuddered and said quotyour tomatoes look delicious but what i really need is directions were looking for number eleven stafford streetquot quotarundelquot quoti dont know about any arundel were supposed to be renting a cottage at that addressquot quotthats arundel mrs tiftons place beautiful woman snooty as all getout tooquot quotoh dearquot quotyoull be fine there are a couple of nice surprises over there youre going to have to keep that blond one under control thoughquot he said nodding toward the car where skye and jane were now leaning out of the window together listening muffled complaints could be heard from batty who was being squashed quotwhy mequot called skye the man winked at rosalind quoti can always spot the troublemakers i was one myself now tell your dad to go down this road a little ways take the first left then a quick right and look for number elevenquot quotthank youquot said rosalind and turned to go
