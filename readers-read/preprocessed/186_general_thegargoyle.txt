 i accidents ambush the unsuspecting often violently just like love it was good friday and the stars were just starting to dissolve into the dawn as i drove i stroked the scar on my chest by habit my eyes were heavy and my vision unfocused not surprising given that i8217d spent the night hunched over a mirror snorting away the bars of white powder that kept my face trapped in the glass i believed i was keening my reflexes i was wrong to one side of the curving road was a sharp drop down the mountain8217s slope and on the other was a dark wood i tried to keep my eyes fixed ahead but i had the overwhelming feeling that something was waiting to ambush me from behind the trees perhaps a troop of mercenaries that8217s how drug paranoia works of course my heart hammered as i gripped the steering wheel more tightly sweat collecting at the base of my neck between my legs i had wedged a bottle of bourbon which i tried to pull out for another mouthful i lost my grip on the bottle and it tumbled into my lap spilling everywhere before falling to the floorboard i bent down to grab it before the remaining alcohol leaked out and when my eyes were lifted i was greeted by the vision the ridiculous vision that set everything into motion i saw a volley of burning arrows swarming out of the woods directly at my car instinct took over and i jerked the steering wheel away from the forest that held my invisible attackers this was not a good idea because it threw my car up against the fencepost wires that separated me from the drop there was the howl of metal on metal the passenger door scraping against taut cables and a dozen thuds as i bounced off the wood posts each bang like electricity through a defibrillator i overcompensated and spun out into the oncoming lane just missing a pickup truck i pulled back too hard on the wheel which sent me once again towards the guardrail the cables snapped and flew everywhere at once like the thrashing tentacles of a harpooned octopus one cracked the windshield and i remember thinking how glad i was that it hadn8217t hit me as the car fell through the arms of the convulsing brute there was a brief moment of weightlessness a balancing point between air and earth dirt and heaven how strange i thought how like the moment between sleeping and falling when everything is beautifully surreal and nothing is corporeal how like floating towards completion but as often happens in that time between existing in the world and fading into dreams this moment over the edge ended with the ruthless jerk back to awareness a car crash seems to take forever and there is always a moment in which you believe that you can correct the error yes you think it8217s true that i8217m plummeting down the side of a mountain in a car that weighs about three thousand pounds it8217s true that it8217s a hundred feet to the bottom of the gully but i8217m sure that if only i twist the steering wheel very hard to one side everything will be okay once you8217ve spun that steering wheel around and found it doesn8217t make any difference you have this one clear pure thought oh shit for a glorious moment you achieve the empty bliss that eastern philosophers spend their lives pursuing but following this transcendence your mind becomes a supercomputer capable of calculating the gyrations of your car multiplying that by the speed of the fall over the angle of descent factoring in newton8217s laws of motion and in a split second coming to the panicked conclusion that this is gonna hurt like hell your car gathers speed down the embankment bouncing your hypothesis is quickly proven correct it is indeed quite painful your brain catalogues the different sensations there is the flipping end over end the swirling disorientation and the shrieks of the car as it practices its unholy yoga there8217s the crush of metal pressing against your ribs there8217s the smell of the devil8217s mischievousness a pitchfork in your ass and sulfur in your mouth the bastard8217s there all right don8217t doubt it i remember the hot silver flash as the floorboard severed all my toes from my left foot i remember the steering column sailing over my shoulder i remember the eruption of glass that seemed to be everywhere around me when the car finally came to a stop i hung upside down seatbelted i could hear the hiss of various gases escaping the engine and the tires still spinning outside above and there was the creak of metal settling as the car stopped rocking a pathetic turtle on its back just as i was beginning my drift into unconsciousness there was the explosion not a movie explosion but a small reallife explosion like the ignition of an unhappy gas oven that holds a grudge against its owner a flash of blue flame skittered across the roof of the car which was at a slanted angle underneath my dangling body out of my nose crawled a drop of blood which jumped expectantly into the happy young flames springing to life beneath me i could feel my hair catch fire then i could smell it my flesh began to singe as if i were a scrap of meat newly thrown onto the barbecue and then i could hear the bubbling of my skin as the flames kissed it i could not reach my head to extinguish my flaming hair my arms would not respond to my commands i imagine dear reader that you8217ve had some experience with heat perhaps you8217ve tipped a boiling kettle at the wrong angle and the steam crept up your sleeve or in a youthful dare you held a match between your fingers for as long as you could hasn8217t everyone at least once filled the bathtub with overly hot water and forgot to dip in a toe before committing the whole foot if you8217ve only had these kinds of minor incidents i want you to imagine something new imagine turning on one of the elements of your stovelet8217s say it8217s the electric kind with black coils on top don8217t put a pot of water on the element because the water only absorbs the heat and uses it to boil maybe some tiny tendrils of smoke curl up from a previous spill on the burner a slight violet tinge will appear nestled there in the black rings and then the element assumes some reddishpurple tones like unripe blackberries it moves towards orange and finallyfinallyan intense glowing red kind of beautiful isn8217t it now lower your head so that your eyes are even with the top of the stove and you can peer through the shimmering waves rising up think of those old movies where the hero finds himself looking across the desert at an unexpected oasis i want you to trace the fingertips of your left hand gently across your right palm noting the way your skin registers even the lightest touch if someone else were doing it you might even be turned on now slam that sensitive responsive hand directly onto that glowing element and hold it there hold it there as the element scorches dante8217s nine rings right into your palm allowing you to grasp hell in your hand forever let the heat engrave the skin the muscles the tendons let it smolder down to the bone wait for the burn to embed itself so far into you that you don8217t know if you8217ll ever be able to let go of that coil it won8217t be long until the stench of your own burning flesh wafts up grabbing your nose hairs and refusing to let go and you smell your body burn i want you to keep that hand pressed down for a slow count of sixty no cheating one mississippi two mississippi three mississippiiiii at sixty mississippi your hand will have melted so that it now surrounds the element becoming fused with it now rip your flesh free i have another task for you lean down turn your head to one side and slap your cheek on the same element i8217ll let you choose which side of your face again sixty mississippis no cheating the convenient thing is that your ear is right there to capture the snap crackle and pop of your flesh now you might have some idea of what it was like for me to be pinned inside that car unable to escape the flames conscious enough to catalogue the experience until i went into shock there were a few short and merciful moments in which i could hear and smell and think still documenting everything but feeling nothing why does this no longer hurt i remember closing my eyes and wishing for complete beautiful blackness i remember thinking that i should have lived my life as a vegetarian then the car shifted once more tipping over into the creek upon whose edge it had been teetering like the turtle had regained its feet and scurried into the nearest water source this occurrencethe car falling into the creeksaved my life by extinguishing the flames and cooling my newly broiled flesh accidents ambush the unsuspecting often violently just like love i have no idea whether beginning with my accident was the best decision as i8217ve never written a book before truth be told i started with the crash because i wanted to catch your interest and drag you into the story you8217re still reading so it seems to have worked the most difficult thing about writing i8217m discovering is not the act of constructing the sentences themselves it8217s deciding what to put in and where and what to leave out i8217m constantly secondguessing myself i chose the accident but i could just as easily have started with any point during my thirtyfive years of life before that why not start with 8220i was born in the year 19 in the city of8221 then again why should i even confine the beginning to the time frame of my life perhaps i should start in nurnberg in the early thirteenth century where a woman with the most unfortunate name of adelheit rotter retreated from a life that she thought was sinful to become a beguinewomen who though not officially associated with the church were inspired to live an impoverished life in imitation of christ over time rotter attracted a legion of followers and in 1240 they moved to a dairy farm at engelschalksdorf near swinach where a benefactor named ulrich ii von konigstein allowed them to live provided they did chores they erected a building in 1243 and the following year established it as a monastery with the election of their first prioress when ulrich died without a male heir he bequeathed his entire estate to the beguines in return he requested that the monastery provide burial places for his relations and that they pray in perpetuity for the konigstein family in a show of good sense he directed that the place be named engelthal or 8220valley of the angels8221 rather than swinach8220place of the pigs8221 but it was ulrich8217s final provision that would have the greatest impact on my life he mandated that the monastery establish a scriptorium 822682268226 eyes open on a red and blue spin of lightning a blitzkrieg of voices noises a metal rod pierces the side of the car jaws it apart uniforms christ i8217m in hell and they wear uniforms one man shouts another says in a soothing voice 8220we8217ll get you out don8217t worry8221 he wears a badge 8220you8217re gonna be all right8221 he promises through his mustache 8220what8217s your name8221 can8217t remember another paramedic yells to someone i can8217t see he recoils at the sight of me are they supposed to do that blackness eyes open i8217m strapped to a spine board a voice 8220three two one lift8221 the sky rushes towards me and then away from me 8220in8221 says the voice a metallic clack as the stretcher snaps into place coffin why no lid too antiseptic for hell and could the roof of heaven really be made of gray metal blackness eyes open weightless again charon wears a blue polyestercotton blend an ambulance siren bounces off a concrete acheron an iv has been inserted into my bodyeverywhere i8217m covered with a gel blanket wet wet blackness eyes open the thud of wheels like a shopping cart on concrete the damn voice says 8220go8221 the sky mocks me passes me by then a plasterwhite ceiling double doors slither open 8220or four8221 blackness eyes open gaping maw of a snake lunging at me laughing speaking i am comingthe serpent tries to engulf my head no not a snake an oxygen maskand there is nothing you can do about it i8217m falling backwards gas mask blackness eyes unveil burning hands burning feet fire everywhere but i am in the middle of a blizzard a german forest and a river is near a woman on a ridge with a crossbow my chest feels as if it8217s been hit i hear the hiss as my heart gives out i try to speak but croak instead and a nurse tells me to rest that everything will be okay everything will be okay blackness a voice floats above me 8220sleep just sleep8221 following my accident i plumped up like a freshly roasted wiener my skin cracking to accommodate the expanding meat the doctors with their hungry scalpels hastened the process with a few quick slices the procedure is called an escharotomy and it gives the swelling tissue the freedom to expand it8217s rather like the uprising of your secret inner being finally given license to claw through the surface the doctors thought they had sliced me open to commence my healing but in fact they only released the monstera thing of engorged flesh suffused with juice while a small burn results in a blister filled with plasma burns such as mine result in the loss of enormous quantities of liquid in my first twentyfour hospital hours the doctors pumped six gallons of isotonic liquid into me to counteract the loss of body fluids i bathed in the liquid as it flowed out of my scorched body as fast as it was pumped in and i was something akin to the desert during a flash flood this tooquick exchange of fluid resulted in an imbalance in my blood chemistry and my immune system staggered under the strain a problem that would become ever more dangerous in the following weeks when the primary threat of death was from sepsis even for a burn victim who seems to be doing well long after his accident infection can pull him out of the game at a moment8217s notice the body8217s defenses are just barely functioning exactly when they are needed most my razed outer layers were glazed with a bloody residue of charred tissue called eschar the hiroshima of the body just as you cannot call a pile of cracked concrete blocks a 8220building8221 after the bomb has detonated neither could you have called my outer layer quotskinquot after the accident i was an emergency state unto myself silver ion and sulfadiazine creams spread over the remains of me over that bandages were laid to rest upon the devastation i was aware of none of this and only learned it later from the doctors at the time i lay comatose with a machine clicking off the sluggish metronome of my heart fluids and electrolytes and antibiotics and morphine were administered through a series of tubes iv tube jejunostomy tube endotracheal tube nasogastric tube urinary tube truly a tube for every occasion a heat shield kept my body warm enough to survive a ventilator did my breathing and i collected enough blood transfusions to shame keith richards the doctors removed my wasteland exterior by debriding me scraping away the charred flesh they brought in tanks of liquid nitrogen containing skin recently harvested from corpses the sheets were thawed in pans of water then neatly arranged on my back and stapled into place just like that as if they were laying strips of sod over the problem areas behind their summer cabins they wrapped me in the skin of the dead my body was cleaned constantly but i rejected these sheets of necroflesh anyway i8217ve never played well with others so over and over again i was sheeted with cadaver skin there i lay wearing dead people as armor against death
