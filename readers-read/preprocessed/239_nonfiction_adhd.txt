 robert a thirdgrader walks to school most days his school is no more than a fiveminute trek from home yet even when robert leaves on time he is often thirty minutes late his classmates don8217t like robert very much they say he8217s bossy and claim he8217s always picking on them robert has problems in the classroom as well he spends the majority of his time under or near his desk rather than sitting down and working his handwriting is sloppy his work is messy and his assignments are frequently left unfinished he8217s constantly losing things and can8217t seem to keep up with the class when they are reading aloud and rarely does he have the right materials out to complete a given task at home robert is equally disorganized his parents say he is extremely messy and has to be repeatedly reminded to complete simple chores in the neighborhood robert has few friends his own age when he plays with them a fight typically ensues over sharing hurt feelings and so forth consequently robert plays mostly with children who are older or younger than he is robert was recently diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd8212and he8217s far from alone adhd is thought to affect some 3 percent to 5 percent of today8217s schoolage children in the united states and while this disorder seems to have emerged from nowhere to become a near epidemic over the last decade it8217s hardly new in fact adhd has been recognized since the early 1900s and is one of the most widely researched of all childhood disorders over the years however8212and to reflect researchers8217 growing advances in concept and theory about this disorder8212adhd has assumed many aliases in the 1930s for example children who exhibited adhdlike symptoms were described as having 8220minimal brain damage8221 in the 1960s that label changed to 8220minimal brain dysfunction8221 and was considered relatively rare by the 1970s however it was called 8220hyperkinesis8221 and up to two hundred thousand children were thought to have the disorder in the late 1980s the term attention deficit disorders add was coined and affected children were categorized as having add with or without hyperactivity the current name attention deficithyperactivity disorder8212or adhd8212was first used in 1994 what is adhd the american psychiatric association redefined adhd in 1994 to describe three subtypes 1nbspadhd predominantly inattentive jill eleven fits this category though bright and intelligent she has trouble paying attention to details and as a result tends to make careless mistakes on classwork and homework her teachers often reprimand jill for gazing out the window instead of listening to directions but jill can8217t help it a chirping bird outside distracts her from the math problem in front of her 2nbspadhd predominantly hyperactiveimpulsive eightyearold sam falls into this subtype he8217s always tapping his pencil squirming in his seat or otherwise fidgeting in class his teachers often send notes home saying 8220sam can8217t stay seated or quiet and often blurts out answers instead of waiting to be called on8221 at home when friends come over sam has trouble waiting his turn while playing games and he8217s constantly interrupting his mom when she8217s on the phone 3nbspadhd combined type a child who falls into this category is inattentive as well as hyperactive and impulsive8212like robert whom you read about earlier one of the reasons robert is often late for school8212even when he leaves on time8212is that he might spot a frog along the way and decide to chase it for a while once he is in school his teacher calls out robert8217s name several times a day because he is often under or near his desk rather than sitting down working robert rarely finishes his assignments in the classroom because he can8217t seem to pay attention long enough to complete them and when his class is reading aloud he has trouble keeping up with them because his mind wanders at home his parents say robert is a whirlwind he rarely sits still even when eating his parents must also repeatedly remind him to do his chores and stay focused on his homework people used to think that adhd was the result of some type of brain damage but scientists now know that8217s not true granted the exact causes of this disorder remain a mystery nevertheless cuttingedge research using computerized imaging technology and other sophisticated diagnostic tools is revealing fascinating clues to why some youngsters8217 brains have a propensity to adhd while others do not scientific evidence suggests that the level of neurological activity is quite different in certain parts of the brain in individuals with adhd compared to those who do not have the disorder differences have also been found in the size of various parts of the brain furthermore at least in some cases of adhd these central nervous system differences appear to have a hereditary component we will talk more about the causes of adhd in chapter three some researchers have described adhd as an inhibition disorder that is children are unable to put the brakes on useless movements can8217t control their distractibility and inattention and can8217t overcome their tendency to daydream it is this inhibition theory that puts adhd in a family with certain other disorders such as depression obsessivecompulsive disorder and tics what it8217s not adhd is a biological not an emotional disorder though it can cause its victims to experience emotional problems at home in school and in social settings neither is adhd a learning disability although many children with adhd also have learning disabilities nor is adhd caused by poor parenting or inadequate teachers although a disorganized home life and school environment can make its symptoms worse some suspect diet as the culprit but extensive research offers proof positive that too much sugar aspartame brand name nutrasweet food additives food coloring and food allergies do not cause adhd either nor does watching too much television or playing too many computer or video games although these may reflect an environment that lacks good supervision and may nurture the development of adhdlike characteristics in a child what is true is that many children with adhd also suffer from other conditions including depression anxiety enuresis bedwetting and tics and for the frustrated parent and the unhappy child sorting out which symptoms are biologically based which are learned behavior which are controllable or not controllable and which are severe enough to interfere with the child8217s success presents a significant dilemma of course not all youngsters who misbehave who have trouble paying attention in school or who have difficulty making friends have adhd in fact a host of physical emotional and situational problems can masquerade as adhd which is why it8217s imperative that a child be properly diagnosed before being treated diagnosis with no virus or bacteria to look for no xrays to take or blood tests to administer how is a diagnosis for adhd made usually it involves input from a team of professionals8212and from the child8217s parents first a medical doctor performs a thorough physical exam8212which often includes neurological tests8212to rule out any physical causes such as vision problems or hearing loss for the difficulties a child is experiencing many physical and medical problems such as thyroid dysfunction may cause behavior that mimics adhd see chapter two for other maladies that can masquerade as adhd once physical causes are ruled out a psychologist may beconsulted she may begin by taking a comprehensive history from the child8217s parents and consulting with the child8217s teachers in addition to asking questions about a child8217s level of achievement as well as social and emotional functioning the psychologist looks for signs of family crises death job loss divorce a recent move that can trigger behavior problems that can be mistaken for adhd gathering input from teachers and other caregivers is equally essential as symptoms that appear only at school or at home may indicate that the problem is not adhd but something related to a specific setting classroom and home behavior is most often evaluated using checklists such as the ones shown on pages 7 and 8 for checklist these checklists allow professionals to get a better idea of a child8217s typical behavior8212particularly behavior that may not be obvious from observation two different checklists are presented one lists problem behavior while the second states positive behavior there are many commonly used checklists for parents and teachers that incorporate one or both of these formats naturally documenting a child8217s behavior in different settings is an important part of the diagnostic process in fact for a correct diagnosis to be made a child must exhibit symptoms in at least two different settings thus the psychologist will frequently observe a child at school as part of the datagathering process so what does the psychologist look for in the school setting a number of characteristics that can support a diagnosis of adhd as well as ideas to help the child improve his or her performance in the classroom for example the psychologist might note how a child8217s seat placement contributes to distractions and how it affects his ability to copy material from the chalkboard or get assistance from another child or the teaching staff the psychologist will likely observe how much time the child spends paying attention to assigned work versus the amount of time spent daydreaming or working on other unassigned tasks she might observe how the child gets along with his peers as well as the types of children he gets along with best8212or worst the psychologist will likely monitor how successful the child is at paying attention to and completing independent work and compare that to his performance in class discussions or in small groups she will also note the frequency and intensity of the child8217s problem behavior8212and how the teacher responds to the child the problem is that a child with adhd may show different behavior in different settings at different times of day with different people and when different levels of challenge are presented therefore relying on the report of one observer or formulating an impression of a child from an isolated observation may offer only a narrow view of the child8217s problem for a diagnosis to be accurate it is important to compare and contrast a child8217s performance under a number of conditions and to analyze observations from various individuals for this reason the psychologist may observe a child several times on different days can the diagnostic process move forward without the input of a psychologist yes it can but some professional must take the lead in gathering information and documentation to help the physician make a diagnosis and to help parents and teachers respond to the child8217s needs the parents8217 professional partner may be a private or school psychologist another mental health professional a supportive teacher or school administrator or even a friend who has traveled the same path when evaluating a child for adhd professionals rely on a profile of characteristics that tend to differentiate children who might have adhd from those who do not this profile is then compared with a list of criteria to make an official diagnosis where do these criteria come from they are listed in a manual that is published and revised periodically by the american psychiatric association professionals use this manual to diagnose specific psychiatric and psychological diseases and disorders and in its most recent edition8212 diagnostic and statistical manual8212iv dsmiv 8212the three types of adhd we discussed earlier are listed defining adhd here are details of the three subtypes of adhd adhd predominantly inattentive a diagnosis of this subtype of adhd requires that at least six of the following symptoms have been present for at least six months they must interfere with normal functioning in social academic and occupational skills they must be present in at least two different settings and they must be inconsistent with the child8217s developmental level 1nbspoften fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in school work work or other activities 2nbspoften has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities 3nbspoften does not seem to listen to what is being said to him or her 4nbspoften does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish school work chores or duties in the workplace not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand directions 5nbspoften has difficulty organizing tasks and activities 6nbspoften avoids expresses reluctance about or has difficulty engaging in tasks that require sustained mental effort such as school work or homework 7nbspoften loses things necessary for tasks or activities such as school assignments pencils books tools or toys 8nbspis often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli 9nbspoften forgetful in daily activities adhd predominantly hyperactiveimpulsive what was once called add with hyperactivity has been renamed adhd predominantly hyperactiveimpulsive type for a diagnosis to be made of this condition at least some of the following symptoms must have been present before seven years of age at least six of the symptoms must have been present for at least six months they must interfere with normal functioning in academic social and academic skills they must appear in two or more settings and they must be inconsistent with the child8217s developmental level hyperactivity 1nbspoften fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat 2nbspleaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected 3nbspoften runs about or climbs excessively in situations where it is inappropriate in adolescents or adults may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness 4nbspoften has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly 5nbspis always 8220on the go8221 or acts as if 8220driven by a motor8221 6nbspoften talks excessively impulsivity 7nbspoften blurts out answers to questions before the questions have been completed 8nbspoften has difficulty waiting in lines or awaiting turn in games or group situations 9nbspoften interrupts or intrudes on others for example butts into others8217 conversations or games adhd combined type diagnosing this mixed subtype of adhd requires that a child meet the criteria for both inattentive and hyperactiveimpulsive subtypes moreover at least some of the symptoms must have been present before seven years of age they must appear in at least two different settings at school at home in recreational or social settings they must clearly impair social and academic functioning and they must not be due to other specified developmental or psychiatric disorders if you are a parent it is important that you be wellprepared in providing documentation of your child8217s behavior that you be able to describe his behavior and performance in various situations and that you consider other factors that may be causing your child to perform as he does professionals will use the symptoms listed above8212together with other information from physical exams and reports from teachers and observed behavior8212to determine if your child has adhd what8217s normal what8217s not all children are overly active some of the time many also have short attention spans and may act without thinking several factors however distinguish youngsters with adhd from those who do not have this problem first it8217s true that many of these behavior patterns are developmental in nature in other words they appear in children at certain ages but youngsters typically outgrow them in children with adhd however many such behavior patterns persist these youngsters either do not outgrow the behavior or the behavior disappears for a while then returns second children with adhd often exhibit more such behavior than do children without the disorder during a typical child8217s early years for example the majority of parents deal with a few of these behavior patterns but parents of children with adhd deal with far more such behavior and for a much longer period of time finally parents can usually control a majority of undesirable behavior in children who do not have adhd by using good behavior management strategies youngsters with adhd however tend not to respond to most behavior management strategies or show great inconsistency in their response a harsh reprimand timeout or restriction for example may be enough for most children to be convinced to straighten up but these approaches are not likely to have longlasting effects on a child with adhd describing the child with adhd children with adhd are not all the same they may exhibit some characteristics frequently and others less frequently or not at all yet having a clearer understanding of which behavior may be a consequence of adhd may help parents to better understand their child and to be less frustrated by their behavior in a slight departure from the list of specific symptoms presented earlier consider these descriptions which characterize the kinds of behavior one most often sees in children with adhd fidgets squirms or seems restless children with adhd are often described as 8220always on the move8221 in the classroom they are the toe tappers or the ones who are constantly fiddling with other objects on or in their desks they may chew on their collar or gnaw pencils at home during mealtime they may toy with their silverware or food children with adhd also often demonstrate new and creative ways of sitting in a chair on their legs with legs propped up on a desk or table or halfstanding and halfsitting has difficulty remaining seated teachers report that children with adhd are frequently out of their seats for a variety of reasons they need a drink of water they need to sharpen a pencil they need to go to the bathroom in fact teachers agree that it8217s not unusual to find a child with adhd wandering around the classroom for no apparent reason at home a youngster with adhd usually eats on the go because he has a difficult time remaining seated for an entire meal homework time also suffers because the child is unable to sit still long enough to complete his assignments and when it comes to enjoying activities that require participants to sit for any length of time8212such as concerts lectures and church or synagogue services8212parents often resign themselves to the fact that they cannot take their child along if they do they spend excessive amounts of time reminding him to remain seated and stay quiet is easily distracted children with adhd lose their concentration very easily if there are sounds or movements around them consequently in school they have difficulty focusing on independent seatwork if for example a reading group nearby is making noise the classroom gerbil is exercising or a child sitting next to them is wearing a watch with a loud ticking noise that8217s because many youngsters with adhd are simply unable to disregard distractions like these homework becomes a chore as well when the television or stereo is on in a nearby room or when people are coming and going near the homework area oddly enough however children with adhd may appear freer from distraction when playing video games or watching television this is likely due to the multisensory nature sound color and constant action of these activities consequently the ability to pay attention to these activities is not sufficient to rule out a diagnosis of adhd has difficulty waiting his turn many children with adhd can8217t wait in line as well as other youngsters of the same age some may try to force their way to the front of the line others fidget or constantly touch other children or things while waiting their turn or they may gyrate or dance around in line blurts out answers children with adhd would make ideal quiz show contestants and they may excel at classroom drills where quick answers are rewarded but in a structured classroom setting these children often stand out as being impatient and uncooperative unable to muster the selfdiscipline needed to hold back an answer until they are called upon children with adhd will call out an answer as soon as they think they know it moreover in some instances their comments may be totally unrelated to the specific class activity or discussion this probably occurs because of the associations the child makes in response to a question for example the question 8220what is the capital of montana8221 may get the child thinking of the family trip to montana last year the plane landing in helena the capital their horseback riding excursion at yellowstone and the park ranger they stopped to talk to when the child answers 8220the park ranger8221 there is no way for the teacher to know that the child8217s reply springs from having the answer though her thoughts have speeded right past the appropriate response has difficulty following directions children with adhd usually fare better when dealing with a single set of instructions in fact many become totally lost when they are given several instructions at one time say a parent tells a child to put on her pajamas brush her teeth and come back for a 8220goodnight kiss8221 five minutes later the child is wandering around aimlessly or engaged in her room playing with her cd player not having even begun to do what she was told the same pattern occurs in school when students are given numerous directions for several worksheets at a time the child with adhd may either remember instructions for the first worksheet but not remember others or remember instructions for the last worksheet consequently these children frequently appear to be out of touch with what is going on in the classroom they also have difficulty remembering what they are supposed to do for homework or which books to take home even if they write down assignments the information may often be garbled or wrong has difficulty sustaining attention a classic sign of adhd is the number of incomplete papers the child brings home from school children with adhd have difficulty completing assignments and the appearance of their papers is usually a good indicator of the disorder they may complete the first few problems on a page but the remainder of the page is blank or their papers will look as if they rushed through the work in an attempt to get everything finished without regard to quality or correctness on the flip side some children with adhd are so meticulous that they may do their work over and over until it is perfect but this extra time devoted to perfection often prevents them from completing other important tasks on their todo list shifts from one uncompleted task to another parents of youngsters with adhd often describe their children as having difficulty playing by themselves or as moving from one play activity to another without devoting much attention to any of them teachers agree they describe students with adhd as very impulsive in learning centers and as likely to discontinue working at a project before its completion furthermore these children often leave remnants of their activities around their desk the classroom or the house plays loudly even when warned to calm down children with adhd have a tough time maintaining a quiet state they are also easily aroused by other children as a rule of thumb the louder and busier an environment is the louder and busier the child will be in fact many parents with just one child who live in a relatively quiet home often have a difficult time believing that their child with adhd is as busy and loud in the classroom as the teacher says he is but after further probing these parents usually come up with similar descriptions of how their child typically behaves with them outside the home such as at restaurants or at the mall talks excessively a child with adhd is often described as being very talkative and asking questions that are repetitive or that make little sense 8220like an outofcontrol tape recorder that is locked on playback at a faster speed than normal8221 according to one parent some parents may be quick to defend such behavior 8220she8217s perky just like her mom8221 or 8220he8217s all boy8221 but when it interferes with a child8217s success and is combined with other symptoms of adhd it is reason for concern and action interrupts or intrudes on others parents often describe their children with adhd as interrupting them constantly when they are on the telephone or when they are talking to their spouses or friends efforts to stop this annoying behavior are generally futile they say8212to the point that parentchild shouting matches frequently ensue moreover because of this tendency not only to interfere with what others are saying but also to try to impose their will on others children with adhd are often unpopular in groups does not seem to listen because children with adhd have trouble focusing visually and sustaining visual attention on an individual or an activity people often assume that the child is not listening on the contrary many youngsters with adhd are still able to comprehend what is going on around them in fact teachers and parents are often surprised that the child is able to answer questions or repeat what has been said to him children with severe adhd however may not absorb what is said in addition many children with adhd may have a limited working memory so that they cannot retain verbal directions long enough to carry them all out loses or forgets things children with more severe cases of adhd often are so poorly organized that they never seem to know where papers pencils articles of clothing or other belongings were left they often come home without the books they need for homework for example or may not be able to find a shoe they just had in their hand nor is it unusual for them to forget to relay important written or verbal messages to their parents from their teachers8212or vice versa8212or to spend hours doing their homework then lose their papers before school the next day or forget to turn them in engages in physically dangerous activities because youngsters with adhd tend to be impulsive they often act before thinking for instance they might run out into a street after a ball without looking jump from heights without considering potential danger or ride a bicycle at breakneck speed without considering what is in front of them more clues and characteristics parents and teachers report other behavioral patterns they see at home in school and in the community works better oneonone than independently or in large groups if your child has adhd you may find that homework goes much more quickly if you sit with him while he does it left alone to complete his homework8212or classwork8212a child with this disorder will more than likely be up and down fidget daydream stare out the window and not finish the work even sitting with your child may require constant redirection and hours of dealing with inefficient work skills however the fact that your child can do the work if you sit with him indicates his ability to master the material plays better with older or younger than with sameage children parents of children with adhd often worry about their child playing almost exclusively with much younger or much older children actually there8217s a good reason why this happens youngsters with adhd are often bossy or pick on other children and while they may get away with bossing around younger children sameage peers won8217t put up with such a demanding playmate older children also tend to be more tolerant of this type of behavior or the child with adhd may control his behavior better among older children for fear of being rejected and losing the status of being able to play with them in any case the child is likely to be alienated from his peers and to have more relationships with younger and older children a child with adhd may also play successfully with just one child in group situations however conflicts are likely to occur that8217s because in most social situations children with adhd have difficulty reading social cues they simply don8217t recognize when others are sending nonverbal messages that say 8220you8217re coming on too strong8221 or 8220back off8221 has difficulty copying words from the chalkboard or book to paper the process of transferring information requires looking retaining in working memory what was seen then unloading that information onto paper this can be a difficult process for children with adhd since fleeting attention limits the amount of information that can be stored in memory from a single glance even when information is stored it may be done in a faulty manner or there may be errors spelling mistakes reversing information adding or deleting information in transferring the information from memory to paper for youngsters with adhd transferring information accurately requires many more glances at the source material but these children are likely to tire of this quickly and may very well just write down what they think they saw knows material well while studying then performs poorly on a test there are few situations more frustrating to parents than when the night before a test their child appears to know the material very well yet the next day takes the test and scores a 42 what went wrong during studying the child8217s attention is focused with the help of a parent during a test however many more distractions are present in the classroom and the child is on his own staying focused and recalling information and often he can8217t in addition the test may take place as long as twenty hours after the child has studied for it so many distractions have intervened since then spelling tests are frequently an exception because a teacher typically calls out a word then waits for each child to finish writing it for this reason many children with adhd perform better on spelling quizzes than they do on other kinds of tests moreover teachers often help children organize the way they study spelling writing the word several times on monday alphabetizing them on tuesday using them in sentences on wednesday and reviewing them on thursday before the test on friday nevertheless once children start to daydream or become distracted in the midst of a spelling test they have a hard time regaining their place and often leave out many words or don8217t complete the last parts of the test responds inconsistently to appropriate incentives what often stymies parents and teachers about children with adhd is the consistency of their inconsistencies for example on one occasion a child might work quickly at cleaning up his room in order to go swimming with his friends in a similar situation at a different time however his parents may find him in his room playing instead of cleaning up and if asked 8220don8217t you want to go swimming8221 his face might light up as if to say 8220why of course why would you ask such a silly question8221 but he also would have to be reminded again about what he needs to do before he can go swimming shows evidence of poor selfesteem the way a child feels about himself is reflected in the look on his face his body language his motivation to participate in various activities and the things he says indeed many children with adhd look sad and choose not to participate in extracurricular activities often this is related to feelings of inadequacy and fear of more failure more distressing to parents however is a child8217s claims that he is stupid that nobody likes him that he hates his parents or that he8217d rather be dead an analysis of these statements is complicated the child who knows that he understands his school work but continues to make poor grades thinks he is stupid in spite of what others tell him this is particularly true when he sees other children getting better grades than he does even when he is sure that he knows more than they do similarly if the children he wants to play with reject him his perception is that 8220nobody8221 likes him even when an adult assures him that he does have close friends from the child8217s perspective it8217s a pretty lousy life and if a child shuts down his engine in the early grades due to lack of success it is very difficult to get it restarted again later is significantly more active than children of the same age this characteristic identifies children with the hyperactivity component of adhd in young children hyperactivity may be manifested in constant movement from one place to another only a few hours of sleep at night restless sleep and an inability to sit in one place for more than a few seconds hyperactivity tends to decrease as a child approaches adolescence however it is typically replaced by more subtle excess movements as a child gets older for example hyperactivity may be characterized more by excessive fidgeting and restlessness furthermore older children often learn to compensate through internal controls either as a consequence of improved neurological organization or because of increased motivation due to peer pressure or other social or tangible incentives demonstrates poor penmanship penmanship is a skill that requires a plan for what one wants to write an understanding of how to put that information on paper and an ability to transfer that plan to paper many children with adhd have a great deal of difficulty mastering one or more of these steps while formulating a plan for what they want to write for example they may become distracted and unable to maintain in memory the complete content of what they want to put on paper or they may have missed the instructions regarding how it is supposed to go down on paper finally the attention required to the details of putting something down on paper may be so poor that neatness is compromised consequently writing that may start off looking good while attention is high can quickly deteriorate as the child proceeds with the writing task letters may become less legible and the spacing size or positioning of the letters and words may be poor in short the child may be able to concentrate on the neatness or the content but not both simultaneously lies or makes up stories parents and teachers often report utter frustration with children who have adhd because they lie about obvious events for example the teacher may see a child take an object from another child8217s desk and put it in her desk when confronted the child denies that she took it and tends to blame someone else or shrug her shoulders many children with adhd will deny that they have homework that the teacher told them about a test or that they took something from school that did not belong to them for example while this kind of behavior is characteristic of many young children appropriate consequences typically cause the behavior to disappear when the behavior persists in a child with adhd however it is probably related to the child8217s impulsiveness in other words a youngster with adhd will act on an idea that comes to mind without becoming conscious of it for example he may see a nice pencil sharpener on another child8217s desk and say to himself 8220i sure wish i had that pencil sharpener8221 the next thing the child knows it is in his hand or on his desk and he never is aware of the process of taking it from the other child8217s desk it is this same lack of conscious monitoring of behavior that causes children with adhd to blurt out embarrassing and outrageous statements or to be reported for having their hands all over other children as a consequence of adhd the child does a poor job monitoring his own behavior and therefore may be totally unaware of what he says or does in many instances coexisting conditions about twothirds of children with adhd also exhibit one or more other conditions many of these are worrisome to parents8212and rightfully so later in this book however we will talk about treatment approaches for adhd as well as these coexisting conditions which should provide more optimism that good outcomes are possible with early diagnosis and prevention the most common coexisting psychological conditions with adhd are oppositional defiant disorder odd and conduct disorder cd learning disabilities mood disorders including depression and bipolar disorder anxiety disorder and tics the child with odd argues with adults blames others refuses to follow rules gets angry easily and frequently annoys others odd is found in about 40 percent of children with adhd conduct disorders affect about onequarter of children with adhd and are characterized by behaviors usually associated with juvenile delinquency destroying property lying and stealing truancy and hurting people and animals because symptoms often worsen as the child gets older early identification and treatment is critical the combination of adhd and cd is particularly troublesome in that children with these untreated coexisting conditions have a very high risk of social and emotional problems in later years they also are twice as likely to have reading problems than children who have only adhd as many as half of children with adhd also have a learning disability8212usually defined as a significant difference between two or more areas of achievement such as reading math or writing or between an area of achievement and intelligence the problem is it8217s often difficult to determine whether this is a separate problem or one directly related to adhd reading disabilities are usually the first to show up with delays usually occurring in the first and second grades that8217s because unlike simple math skills8212where children can use their fingers or objects to solve problems8212reading requires that a child recognize letter symbols learn their names and corresponding sounds and be able to retrieve and combine them on demand actually the foundation for learning to read begins to form well before a child enters kindergarten the typical child takes notice of shapes letters and words and shows an early curiosity about them the young child with adhd however may not focus long enough to construct that solid foundation of prereading skills math difficulties on the other hand don8217t usually surface until the introduction of word problems and multiplication and division that8217s because these skills require more complex mental calculations and information retrieval than simple addition and subtraction which a child may have accomplished using his fingers stroke marks or objects regardless of subject only after successful treatment to control the symptoms of adhd can one determine if the child has a true learning disability or simply has a learning problem related to the adhd mood problems are common as well in children with adhd many of these youngsters appear sad much of the time or show frequent and dramatic swings in mood much like learning disabilities depression may also be a separate problem it does tend to run in families or it could be related to the symptoms of adhd for example a child who is bossy and impulsive is not likely to have many friends and if being a social outcast is accompanied by disappointing report cards conflicts at home and low selfesteem it8217s easy for a child to feel sad rejected and unsuccessful as a result he may say that nobody likes him or that he would rather be dead as a child suffering from adhd or depression8212or both8212gets older he may be more and more reluctant to participate in group activities he may also have trouble sleeping or eating and show little enthusiasm for activities he once enjoyed some teenagers react to all this by adopting different styles of dress others might undertake body piercing or even begin cutting themselves as many as one in five children with adhd also has bipolar disorder at younger ages this disorder is characterized by rapid mood changes with no clear reason the child may act sad and irritable or be combative and aggressive unlike adults in whom cycles of depression and mania can last for days or weeks children cycle much more rapidly while mania can be very debilitating as a child gets older the combination of adhd and mania is particularly problematic and can interfere with success in every aspect of life about one in ten children with adhd also has an anxiety disorder together with adhd while most individuals experience some anxiety and nervousness in particular situations a child with an anxiety disorder worries excessively has many unwarranted fears and feels stressed out or tense much of the time some children experience panic attacks characterized by difficulty breathing dizziness a pounding heart sweating and fearfulness not surprisingly children with anxiety disorders and adhd have more problems in school at home and in the community than children who have only adhd a small number of children with adhd also have tics or tourette8217s syndrome tics are nonpurposeful movements8212such as neck stretching eye scrunching and lip licking8212that occur over and over and that the child cannot control tourette8217s syndrome is a combination of tics and uncontrolled vocalization such as sniffing or throat clearing stress and fatigue may increase the frequency of the tics some children with adhd have obsessions and compulsions as well obsessions are persistent unpleasant thoughts or feelings that interfere with the ability to function normally compulsions are ritualistic activities children feel they must engage in before moving on to another activity or continuing with what they were already doing for example some youngsters may feel compelled to wash their hands repeatedly after touching a certain object are driven to follow a certain pattern of behavior before leaving the house or must place objects in a particular order before feeling at ease others must have their food arranged in a certain way on their plate or they must eat foods in a certain order some children with adhd may have a very low tolerance for loud noises or other stimuli for example their socks must fit a certain way or they may be unable to wear shirts with labels that rub against their skin 8220the wrong way8221 many youngsters with adhd are persistent bedwetters a condition called enuresis while only about 10 percent of children in the normal population continue to wet the bed at night beyond the age of six this problem tends to be overrepresented in the population of children with adhd moreover the most common behavior approaches used to curb bedwetting8212reducing fluid intake after dinner having the child empty his bladder before he goes to bed and again before his parents turn in8212yield little consistent success in children with adhd even use of the popular bell and pad method is only moderately successful for these youngsters and may only add to the stresses the child and his family are experiencing with this method a special pad is placed under the sheet when it is wet by urine a bell connected to the pad rings this awakens the child who can then get up and complete urinating in the toilet as mentioned earlier many children with adhd also show signs of depression that may be related to feelings of despair brought on by inability to meet their own8212or others82178212expectations it is painful for parents to see their children so unhappy it is even more painful for the child to live a life characterized by feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that8217s why careful diagnosis of adhd is necessary it can help determine if a child8217s depression has resulted from a specific event8212such as a parental divorce death of a family member or a serious fight with a best friend8212or from more global factors such as continual underachievement as a result of symptoms of adhd lisa8217s story is an excellent example lisa is a fourthgrader who consistently makes a8217s and b8217s on her report card and who rarely has her name put on the board for misbehaving lisa is also a popular child with lots of friends for the past week or so however lisa has made low d8217s on the majority of her tests and has failed to turn in her homework most mornings her name has been put on the board at least twice every day for talking back to the teacher and on the playground she has been repeatedly reprimanded for pushing and yelling at her friends lisa8217s teacher tried talking to her but lisa insisted that nothing was wrong when the teacher threatened to call lisa8217s parents the child became defiant 8220fine8221 she said 8220i don8217t care they8217re not home anyway8221 when her teacher called lisa8217s parents to schedule a conference a babysitter reported that they were indeed out of town lisa8217s grandmother8212with whom the child had been very close8212had just died and lisa8217s parents had gone out of town for two weeks to attend the funeral and to help take care of lisa8217s grandfather once the teacher approached lisa about her grandmother8217s death lisa burst into tears and apologized for misbehaving and not doing her work the school counselor spent several hours with lisa over the next few weeks and lisa soon returned to her old self summary children with adhd are a diverse group they are affected by biological hereditary and environmental factors that researchers are still trying to unravel many children have problems beyond adhd which may have further dramatic impact on their successful performance in school at home and in the community8212both in the near and long term it8217s up to parents to be alert to the first signs and symptoms of adhd8212and experts agree these may show up as early as infancy and toddlerhood in the form of frequent temper tantrums severe separation anxiety constant refusals to go to sleep and other unruly behavior yet sadly studies show that most youngsters go a full decade before they are properly diagnosed with this treatable disorder successful treatment of adhd requires that a team of professionals work together which can be overwhelming for parents but the good news is that early diagnosis intervention and treatment have been shown to help these youngsters overcome their problems and achieve success in all areas of their life
