 excerpt june 1940october 1940 vote for lindbergh or vote for war fear presides over these memories a perpetual fear of course no childhood is without its terrors yet i wonder if i would have been a less frightened boy if lindbergh hadnt been president or if i hadnt been the offspring of jews when the first shock came in june of 1940the nomination for the presidency of charles a lindbergh americas international aviation hero by the republican convention at philadelphiamy father was thirtynine an insurance agent with a grade school education earning a little under fifty dollars a week enough for the basic bills to be paid on time but for little more my mother whod wanted to go to teachers college but couldnt because of the expense whod lived at home working as an office secretary after finishing high school whod kept us from feeling poor during the worst of the depression by budgeting the earnings my father turned over to her each friday as efficiently as she ran the household was thirtysix my brother sandy a seventhgrader with a prodigys talent for drawing was twelve and i a thirdgrader a term ahead of himself and an embryonic stamp collector inspired like millions of kids by the countrys foremost philatelist president roosevelt was seven we lived in the secondfloor flat of a small twoandahalffamily house on a treelined street of frame wooden houses with redbrick stoops each stoop topped with a gable roof and fronted by a tiny yard boxed in with a lowcut hedge the weequahic neighborhood had been built on farm lots at the undeveloped southwest edge of newark just after world war one some half dozen of the streets named imperially for victorious naval commanders in the spanishamerican war and the local movie house called after fdrs fifth cousinand the countrys twentysixth presidentthe roosevelt our street summit avenue sat at the crest of the neighborhood hill an elevation as high as any in a port city that rarely rises a hundred feet above the level of the tidal salt marsh to the citys north and east and the deep bay due east of the airport that bends around the oil tanks of the bayonne peninsula and merges there with new york bay to flow past the statue of liberty and into the atlantic looking west from our bedrooms rear window we could sometimes see inland as far as the dark treeline of the watchungs a lowlying mountain range fringed by great estates and affluent sparsely populated suburbs the extreme edge of the known worldand about eight miles from our house a block to the south was the workingclass town of hillside whose population was predominantly gentile the boundary with hillside marked the beginning of union county another new jersey entirely we were a happy family in 1940 my parents were outgoing hospitable people their friends culled from among my fathers associates at the office and from the women who along with my mother had helped to organize the parentteacher association at newly built chancellor avenue school where my brother and i were pupils all were jews the neighborhood men either were in business for themselvesthe owners of the local candy store grocery store jewelry store dress shop furniture shop service station and delicatessen or the proprietors of tiny industrial job shops over by the newarkirvington line or selfemployed plumbers electricians housepainters and boilermenor were footsoldier salesmen like my father out every day in the city streets and in peoples houses peddling their wares on commission the jewish doctors and lawyers and the successful merchants who owned big stores downtown lived in onefamily houses on streets branching off the eastern slope of the chancellor avenue hill closer to grassy wooded weequahic park a landscaped three hundred acres whose boating lake golf course and harnessracing track separated the weequahic section from the industrial plants and shipping terminals lining route 27 and the pennsylvania railroad viaduct east of that and the burgeoning airport east of that and the very edge of america east of thatthe depots and docks of newark bay where they unloaded cargo from around the world at the western end of the neighborhood the parkless end where we lived there resided an occasional schoolteacher or pharmacist but otherwise few professionals were among our immediate neighbors and certainly none of the prosperous entrepreneurial or manufacturing families the men worked fifty sixty even seventy or more hours a week the women worked all the time with little assistance from laborsaving devices washing laundry ironing shirts mending socks turning collars sewing on buttons mothproofing woolens polishing furniture sweeping and washing floors washing windows cleaning sinks tubs toilets and stoves vacuuming rugs nursing the sick shopping for food cooking meals feeding relatives tidying closets and drawers overseeing paint jobs and household repairs arranging for religious observances paying bills and keeping the familys books while simultaneously attending to their childrens health clothing cleanliness schooling nutrition conduct birthdays discipline and morale a few women labored alongside their husbands in the familyowned stores on the nearby shopping streets assisted after school and on saturdays by their older children who delivered orders and tended stock and did the cleaning up it was work that identified and distinguished our neighbors for me far more than religion nobody in the neighborhood had a beard or dressed in the antiquated old world style or wore a skullcap either outdoors or in the houses i routinely floated through with my boyhood friends the adults were no longer observant in the outward recognizable ways if they were seriously observant at all and aside from older shopkeepers like the tailor and the kosher butcherand the ailing or decrepit grandparents living of necessity with their adult offspringhardly anyone in the vicinity spoke with an accent by 1940 jewish parents and their children at the southwestern corner of new jerseys largest city talked to one another in an american english that sounded more like the language spoken in altoona or binghamton than like the dialects famously spoken across the hudson by our jewish counterparts in the five boroughs hebrew lettering was stenciled on the butcher shop window and engraved on the lintels of the small neighborhood synagogues but nowhere else other than at the cemetery did ones eye chance to land on the alphabet of the prayer book rather than on the familiar letters of the native tongue employed all the time by practically everyone for every conceivable purpose high or low at the newsstand out front of the corner candy store ten times more customers bought the racing form than the yiddish daily the forvertz israel didnt yet exist six million european jews hadnt yet ceased to exist and the local relevance of distant palestine under british mandate since the 1918 dissolution by the victorious allies of the last farflung provinces of the defunct ottoman empire was a mystery to me when a stranger who did wear a beard and who never once was seen hatless appeared every few months after dark to ask in broken english for a contribution toward the establishment of a jewish national homeland in palestine i who wasnt an ignorant child didnt quite know what he was doing on our landing my parents would give me or sandy a couple of coins to drop into his collection box largess i always thought dispensed out of kindness so as not to hurt the feelings of a poor old man who from one year to the next seemed unable to get it through his head that wed already had a homeland for three generations i pledged allegiance to the flag of our homeland every morning at school i sang of its marvels with my classmates at assembly programs i eagerly observed its national holidays and without giving a second thought to my affinity for the fourth of july fireworks or the thanksgiving turkey or the decoration day doubleheader our homeland was america then the republicans nominated lindbergh and everything changed for nearly a decade lindbergh was as great a hero in our neighborhood as he was everywhere else the completion of his thirtythreeandahalfhour nonstop solo flight from long island to paris in the tiny monoplane the spirit of st louis even happened to coincide with the day in the spring of 1927 that my mother discovered herself to be pregnant with my older brother as a consequence the young aviator whose daring had thrilled america and the world and whose achievement bespoke a future of unimaginable aeronautical progress came to occupy a special niche in the gallery of family anecdotes that generate a childs first cohesive mythology the mystery of pregnancy and the heroism of lindbergh combined to give a distinction bordering on the divine to my very own mother for whom nothing less than a global annunciation had accompanied the incarnation of her first child sandy would later record this moment with a drawing illustrating the juxtaposition of those two splendid events in the drawingcompleted at the age of nine and smacking inadvertently of soviet poster artsandy envisioned her miles from our house amid a joyous crowd on the corner of broad and market a slender young woman of twentythree with dark hair and a smile that is all robust delight she is surprisingly on her own and wearing her floralpatterned kitchen apron at the intersection of the citys two busiest thoroughfares one hand spread wide across the front of the apron where the span of her hips is still deceptively girlish while with the other she alone in the crowd is pointing skyward to the spirit of st louis passing visibly above downtown newark at precisely the moment she comes to realize that in a feat no less triumphant for a mortal than lindberghs she has conceived sanford roth sandy was four and i philip wasnt yet born when in march 1932 charles and anne morrow lindberghs own first child a boy whose arrival twenty months earlier had been an occasion for national rejoicing was kidnapped from his familys secluded new house in rural hopewell new jersey some ten weeks later the decomposing body of the baby was discovered by chance in woods a few miles away the baby had been either murdered or killed accidentally after being snatched from his crib and in the dark still in bedclothes carried out a window of the secondstory nursery and down a makeshift ladder to the ground while the nurse and mother were occupied in their ordinary evening activities in another part of the house by the time the kidnapping and murder trial in flemington new jersey concluded in february 1935 with the conviction of bruno hauptmanna german excon of thirtyfive living in the bronx with his german wifethe boldness of the worlds first transatlantic solo pilot had been permeated with a pathos that transformed him into a martyred titan comparable to lincoln following the trial the lindberghs left america hoping through a temporary expatriation to protect a new lindbergh infant from harm and to recover some measure of the privacy they coveted the family moved to a small village in england and from there as a private citizen lindbergh began taking the trips to nazi germany that would transform him into a villain for most american jews in the course of five visits during which he was able to familiarize himself at first hand with the magnitude of the german war machine he was ostentatiously entertained by air marshal gring he was ceremoniously decorated in the name of the fhrer and he expressed quite openly his high regard for hitler calling germany the worlds most interesting nation and its leader a great man and all this interest and admiration after hitlers 1935 racial laws had denied germanys jews their civil social and property rights nullified their citizenship and forbidden intermarriage with aryans by the time i began school in 1938 lindberghs was a name that provoked the same sort of indignation in our house as did the weekly sunday radio broadcasts of father coughlin the detroitarea priest who edited a rightwing weekly called social justice and whose antisemitic virulence aroused the passions of a sizable audience during the countrys hard times it was in november 1938the darkest most ominous year for the jews of europe in eighteen centuriesthat the worst pogrom in modern history kristallnacht was instigated by the nazis all across germany synagogues incinerated the residences and businesses of jews destroyed and throughout a night presaging the monstrous future jews by the thousands forcibly taken from their homes and transported to concentration camps when it was suggested to lindbergh that in response to this unprecedented savagery perpetrated by a state on its own nativeborn he might consider returning the gold cross decorated with four swastikas bestowed on him in behalf of the fhrer by air marshal gring he declined on the grounds that for him to publicly surrender the service cross of the german eagle would constitute an unnecessary insult to the nazi leadership lindbergh was the first famous living american whom i learned to hatejust as president roosevelt was the first famous living american whom i was taught to loveand so his nomination by the republicans to run against roosevelt in 1940 assaulted as nothing ever had before that huge endowment of personal security that i had taken for granted as an american child of american parents in an american school in an american city in an america at peace with the world the only comparable threat had come some thirteen months earlier when on the basis of consistently high sales through the worst of the depression as an agent with the newark office of metropolitan life my father had been offered a promotion to assistant manager in charge of agents at the companys office six miles west of our house in union a town whose only distinction i knew of was a drivein theater where movies were shown even when it rained and where the company expected my father and his family to live if he took the job as an assistant manager my father could soon be making seventyfive dollars a week and over the coming years as much as a hundred a week a fortune in 1939 to people with our expectations and since there were onefamily houses selling in union for a depression low of a few thousand dollars he would be able to realize an ambition he had nurtured growing up penniless in a newark tenement flat to become an american homeowner pride of ownership was a favorite phrase of my fathers embodying an idea real as bread to a man of his background one having to do not with social competitiveness or conspicuous consumption but with his standing as a manly provider
