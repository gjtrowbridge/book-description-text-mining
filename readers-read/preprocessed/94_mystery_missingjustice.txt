 excerpt chapter 1 back to the main missing justice page if its true that dreams come from the id then my id is not particularly creative the dream that makes its way into my bed tonight is the same one that has troubled my sleep almost every night for the past month once again i relive the events that led to the deaths of three men the walls of the stairway pass as a man follows me upstairs i force myself to focus on my own movements trying to block out thoughts of the other man downstairs armed and determined to kill me when i return time slows as i duck beside my bed reach for the pistol hidden inside my nightstand and rise up to surprise him the 25 caliber automatic breaks the silence more shots follow downstairs glass shatters heavy footsteps thunder through the house in the dream i see bullets rip through flesh and muscle the scene tinted red like blood smeared across my retinas i usually wake during the chaos tonight though the silence returns and i walk past the dead bodies to my kitchen i open the pantry door and find a woman whose face i know only from photographs and a brief introduction two years ago she is crouched on the floor with her head between her knees when she looks up at me and reaches for my hand the phone rings and im back in my bedroom it is four oclock in the morning and as usual i wake up chilly having kicked my comforter deep into the crevice between my mattress and the footboard of my maple sleigh bed i fumble for the phone on my nightstand still ringing in the dark quotthis better be worth itquot i say its detective raymond johnson of the portland police bureaus major crimes team a member of the search team has found a womans sizeseven black cole haan loafer in the gutter but clarissa easterbrook is still missing the call came only eight hours after my boss district attorney duncan griffith had first summoned me to the easterbrook home it was my first callout after a monthlong hiatus and a new promotion from the drug and vice division into major crimes i was told it would just be some quick pr work to transition me back into the office so far the transition had been rough when i pulled into the easterbrook driveway that first evening i cut the engine and sat for a few last quiet moments in my jetta noticing detective johnson waiting for me at the front window i took a deep breath released the steering wheel and climbed out of the car grabbing my briefcase from the passenger seat as i exhaled i climbed a series of steep slate steps a trek made necessary by the homes impressive hillside location despite the spring mist i was able to take in the exterior dr townsend easterbrook was clearly no slouch i wasnt sure which was bigger the doubledoor entranceway or the expedition id parked next to johnson opened one of the doors before id had a chance to use either of the square pewter knockers i could make out voices at the back of the house johnson kept his own down quotsat in that car so long kincaid thought something might be wrong with your feetquot at least my first case back on the job brought some familiar faces i had met raymond johnson and his partner jack walker only two months ago when i was a mere drug and vice deputy but given the history however recent i felt a bond with these guys the gunky kind that threatens to stick around for good quotyou must not have given up all hope johnson you were waiting at the doorquot quoti was beginning to wonder but then you tripped something off walking up the path and i heard a voice somewhere announcing a visitor george fucking jetson house gives me the creepsquot the easterbrook home wasnt exactly cozy but id take it neutral colors steel and low sleek furniture the place was a twentyfirst century update on 1960s kitsch with any luck clarissa easterbrook would turn up soon and thered be no need to disrupt all this coolness johnson caught my eye as i studied the house quotlook at you girl youre almost as dark as i amquot he grabbed my hand and held it next to the back of his not even close johnsons beautiful skin is about as dark as it comes quotyeah but youre still better lookingquot he laughed but it was true he also dressed better than me more hollywood red carpet than police precinct linoleum quotgriffith dragged you back from maui just for thisquot quoti flew in last night i sort of assumed id have sunday to myself before i headed back in tomorrow but the boss must have thought it would do me good to get some handholding practice while we wait for easterbrook to turn up you know ease me out of drug cases into the new gigquot quotthey usually doquot johnson said quotturn up i mean she probably went shopping and lost track of time or went out for a drink with the girlsquot quotright because of course thats all women do in their spare time shopping and girl talkquot quotthis is going to take some getting used to kincaid after seven years of mct work with odonnellquot i didnt react to the mention of my predecessor quotjust doing my part to lead you down the path of enlightenment ray clarissa easterbrooks an administrative law judge not some bored housewifequot quotoh so its only women lawyers who excel beyond malls and gossip got it note to all detectivesquot he said as if he were speaking into a dictation recorder quotthe new major crimes unit da says its still ok to dis housewivesquot he dropped the routine and cocked a finger at me quotbustedquot there was no arguing it so i laughed instead quotwhos in the backquot i asked leaning my head toward the ongoing murmurs quotwalkers back there with the husband and the sister we got here about half an hour ago and the sister showed up right after we havent been able to do much more than try to calm them down we need to start working on the timeline though i stayed out here to wait for you i suspect dr easterbrooks still getting used to having a brother in the housequot it was unusual to have mct involved so early in a missing persons case but walker and johnson were here from the bureaus major crimes team for the same reason i was to make sure that our offices looked responsive and concerned when the missing judge showed up and to triplecheck that the investigation was perfect just in case she didnt quotsounds good ill do my part for the family and any press but for now you guys take the lead on interviewsquot quotmusic to my ears kincaidquot he began walking toward the back of the house but i stopped him with a hand on his elbow quoti assume youre keeping things gentle for now just in case and absolutely no searches not even with consentquot if clarissa easterbrook had encountered anything criminal everyone close to her would become a suspect especially her husband we couldnt do anything now that might jeopardize our investigation down the road quoti shouldve known it was too good to be true all das just got to have their say its in the bloodquot i could tell from his smile that he wasnt annoyed quotno worries nowquot we made our way to the kitchen walking past a builtin rock fountain that served as a room divider the easterbrooks had sprung for marble countertops and stainless steel subzero everything but it looked like no one ever cooked here in fact as far as i could tell no one even lived here the only hint of disorder was in a corner of the kitchen where the contents of a canvas book bag were spread out on the counter next to a frazzledlooking brunette she had a cell phone to one ear and an index finger in the other jack walker greeted us with his short sleeves striped tie and bald head he had enough of the cop look going to make up for his partner quotwelcome back you look greatquot he said into my ear as he shook my hand with a friendly squeeze quotdr easterbrook this is deputy district attorney samantha kincaidquot there are women who would describe townsend easterbrook as goodlooking his brown hair was worn just long enough and with just enough gray at the temples to suggest a lack of attention to appearance but the brooks brothers clothes told another story on the spectrum between sloppy apathetic and sloppy preppy there was no question where this man fell he seemed alarmed by the introduction at first i assumed he was nervous i quickly realized it was something else entirely quotplease call me townsend gosh i apologize if i was staring i recognized you from the news but it took me a moment to draw the connectionquot it hadnt dawned on me that at least for the foreseeable future former strangers would know me as the local annie oakley one more daily annoyance terrific quotim sorry to meet you under these circumstances dr easterbrook duncan had to be in salem tonight but he wanted me to assure you that our office will do everything within our power to help find your wifequot when griffith called he had insisted that i use his first name with the family and assure dr easterbrook that he would have been here personally if he werent locked in legislative hearings all week other missing people might disappear with little or no official response but dr easterbrooks phone call to 911 had ripped like a lightning bolt through the power echelon the wife was sure to turn up but this was griffiths chance to say i feel your pain and easterbrook clearly was in pain quotthank you for coming so quicklyquot he said his voice shaking quoti feel foolish now that youre all here but we werent sure what we should be doing clarissas sister and i have been calling everyone we can possibly think ofquot quotthats your sisterinlawquot i asked looking toward the woman in the corner still clutching the phone quotyes tara she came in from the dalles i called her earlier to see if shed heard from clarissa today then i called her again when i saw that griffey was gone tooquot walker tapped the pocketsize notebook he held in his hand with a dainty gold pen that didnt suit him most likely a gift from one of his six daughters it looked tiny between his sausage fingers quotdr easterbrook was just telling me he got home from the hospital at sixthirty tonight his wife was home when he left this morning at sixquot a twelvehour day probably wasnt unusual for the attending surgeon at the oregon health sciences university even on a sunday looking at him now though it was hard to imagine him steadying a scalpel just four hours ago easterbrook continued where he must have left off quotshe was still in bed when i left sort of awake but still asleepquot he was staring blankly in front of him probably remembering how cute his wife is when she is sleepy quotshe hadnt mentioned any plans so when i got home and she wasnt here i assumed she went out to the market we usually have dinner in on sundays as long as im homequot quotyouve checked for her carquot walker said it was more of a statement than a question quotright that was the first thing i did once i was out of my scrubs i changed clothes and walked down to the garage when i saw the lexus i thought she must have walked somewhere i tried her cell but i kept getting her voice mail finally around eight i thought to look out back for griffey when i saw he was gone too i drove around the neighborhood for what must have been an hour i finally got so worried i called the policequot in the corner clarissas sister snapped her cell phone shut and blew her bangs from her eyes quotthats it ive called everyonequot she said looking up quotoh sorry i didnt realize anyone else was herequot quotfrom the district attorneys officequot townsend explained quotms kincaid this is clarissas sister tara carneyquot it was hard to see the resemblance my guess is they were both pushing forty tara perhaps a little harder but they had been different kinds of years clarissa was a thin frosted blonde who favored pastel suits and high heels taras dark brown pageboy framed a round face and she looked at ease at least physically in her dark green sweat suit and sneakers she acknowledged me with a nod quoti called everyone i can think of and no ones heard from her today this just isnt like herquot quotshes never gone out for the day without telling someonequot walker asked they both shook their heads in frustration quotnothing like this at allquot townsend said quotshe often runs late at work during the week we both do but she wouldnt just leave the house like this on the weekend with the dog for hours something must be wrongquot we asked all the other obvious questions but tara and townsend had covered the bases before dialing 911 they had knocked on doors but the neighbors hadnt noticed anything clarissa hadnt left a note they didnt even know what she was wearing because when townsend left that morning she was still in her pajamas her purse and keys were missing along with griffey but townsend doubted she was walking the dog she always walked him in the morning and sometimes they walked him together after dinner if they were both home but she didnt take griffey out alone after dark anyway we were talking about tenminute potty trips not allnight strolls walker was rising from his chair quotfinding out how shes dressed is a priorityquot he was shifting into action mode quotif we go through some of her things do you think you might be able to figure out what shes wearingquot quot you would be the one to go through your wifes belongingsquot i corrected we had to keep this by the book quoti think what detective walkers suggesting is that you might be able to tell what clothes are missing if you look at whats herequot quotrightquot walker agreed quotand it would help to get a detailed description out as fast as possiblequot it would also help us determine if we were all wasting our time maybe clarissa had packed a suitcase and her dog to run off voluntarily with a new man or simply to a new life without this one quotyou either overestimate my familiarity with clothing or underestimate clarissas wardrobe tara can you help i doubt i can be of any usequot i suggested that we all go upstairs together while tara looked through clarissas closet johnson offered to stay downstairs in case anyone knocked but easterbrook assured him that the houses quotsmart systemquot would alert us if anyone approached the door of course johnson already knew that so i gave him a warning look over my shoulder to join me as i followed townsend and tara up the hammeredsteel staircase no way was he sneaking around down here while the family was upstairs especially in a house with its own intelligence system the easterbrook master suite was the size of my entire second floor a thousand square feet of spastyle opulence townsend led us through a large sitting area past the kingsize bed and around the back of a partial wall that served as the beds headboard i couldnt help but notice that the lip balm on the nightstand was the same brand as my own the paperback novel one id read last year the back of the suite contained a marblerich bathroom adjoining a dressing area roughly the size of memphis townsend wasnt kidding about his wifes wardrobe tara started flipping through the piles of folded clothes stacked neatly into maple cubes the hanging items looked workrelated after shed gone through the top two rows tara blew her bangs out of her face again quotshe tends to wear the same few things when shes around the house but the ones i can remember are all here i just dont knowquot townsend stood in the corner of the closet seemingly distracted by a pair of animal cracker print pajamas that hung from a hook tara was unfazed by the moments poignancy or at least she did not let it halt her determination she was examining rows of shoes stacked neatly on a rack built into the side of the closet quotwell it looks like her favorite black loafers are gone cole haans i think but i cant tell what clothes are missing shes just got too much stuffquot she walked over to a nordstrom shopping bag on the floor next to the dressing table she pulled out a red sweater set it on the table and then reached back in and removed some loose price tags and a receipt quotthese are from yesterdayquot she said looking at the receipt quottown these are clarissas rightquot she had to repeat the question before he responded quotoh right she did mention something about that last night i thinkquot quotcan you tell anything from the tags walker asked quotnoquot tara said quotwell the brand name but then its just those meaningless style names and numbersquot quotdid anyone go shopping with her we could find out what she bought from themquot i suggested i knew i told johnson id leave the questions to them but i couldnt help myself townsend seemed to wake up for a moment quoti believe she went with susan but quot quotim sorryquot walker interrupted holding up his pen and pad quotwhats susans last namequot tara looked disappointed quotsusan kerr a friend of my sisters ive already tried calling her and all i got was the machinequot a store clerk would be able to determine from the item number what clothes clarissa purchased saturday it wouldnt be easy to get that information at eleven oclock on a sunday night but it was worth trying quotwell track someone down from the storequot i suggested looking toward ray and jack quotcant we pull a number for someone at nordstrom out of ppdsquot the portland police data system compiled information from every city police report and was the handiest source for accessing an individuals contact information within a few minutes walker had the home telephone number of a store manager mentioned in a recent theft case a manager would not be involved in your average shoplifting case but this one had been unusual an employee at one of the local thrift stores had bilked nordstrom out of thousands of dollars in cash by taking advantage of its famously tolerant return policy the bureau estimated that every nordstrom brand dress shirt donated to the thrift store during the last two years had been returned to nordstrom stores for cash by either the employee or one of her friends hopefully the manager would be sufficiently grateful to the bureau for cracking the case that hed forgive us for calling him after ten oclock at night walker made the call on his cell to leave the easterbrooks line open just in case as it turned out the easterbrook phone rang just a few minutes later i found myself watching townsend to see how he responded did he really expect the caller to be clarissa or did he act like a man who already knew we wouldnt be hearing from her so far he seemed legit if dazed he hadnt made any of the obvious slipups the ones you see on court tv using the past tense buying diamonds for another woman selling the wifes stuff things like that whoever was calling it wasnt clarissa listening to one side of the conversation was frustrating quoti see where was he no in fact shes missingquot townsends voice cracked on that one quotthe police are here now yes thats terribly kind of you if you dont mindquot some more earnest thankyous and a goodbye and townsend set the phone back on its base quotthat was a fellow who lives a few streets down he works with me at the hospital he and his wife were leaving the chart house and found a dog running in the parking lot with its leash on its griffeyquot walker had reached the nordstrom manager who generously offered to meet him at the store to track down what clarissa easterbrook had purchased yesterday and was we hoped still wearing about fifteen minutes after walker left a voice similar to the one that announces my emails at home declared quotgood evening you have a visitorquot ray was right creepy george jetson house i looked out the living room window to see a man in his fifties struggling to keep up with an excited yellow lab dashing up the slope to the front door straining against the leash a woman of roughly the same age followed when easterbrook opened the door the lab finally pulled free from his temporary handler dragging his leash behind him he leaped on easterbrooks chest nearly knocking him over he was a sticky mess from the drizzle but you could tell he was a wellcaredfor dog townsend absently convinced griffey to lie down by the fountain though the panting and tail thumping revealed that he was still excited to be home a dog like griffey probably had an advanced degree from obedience school unlike my dropout vinnie vinnie was actually expelled or more accurately i was when it became clear to the teacher that despite her instructions i caved to vinnies every demand to avoid his strategic peeing episodes she suggested that i reenroll my french bulldog when i felt more committed to the process two years later vinnie and i have come to mutually agreeable terms he has a doggie door to the backyard an automatic feeder and a rubber gumby doll that he treats like his baby but if i dont come home in time to cuddle him and hear about his day theres hell to pay griffey on the other hand appeared to do whatever easterbrook told him easterbrook introduced griffeys new friends as dr and mrs jonathon fletcher i guess you have to give up both your first and last names when you marry a physician dr fletchers looks said doctor more than townsend easterbrooks in contrast with the flashy expedition and hightech house i noticed that the fletchers pulled up in a volvo station wagon mrs dr fletcher did her best to provide comfort quotim certain clarissas just fine townsend a misunderstanding is all we just have to find her and thats that now whens the last time you saw herquot she made it sound like we were trying to track down a lost set of keys quotthis morningquot townsend said quotshe was still in bed i had backtoback surgeries and when i got home she was gonequot quotwell dear im surprised you even get a chance to operate anymore jonathon tells me how busy you are developing the new transplant unit sounds like thats going extremely wellquot apparently mrs dr fletcher was so used to her job as conversationalist to her husbands colleagues that she was slipping into autopilot understandably townsend cut her off quotwho knows still so much to doquot he said translation who the fuck cares about the hospital right now quoti didnt even realize griffey was gone until a couple of hours ago when did you find himquot quotright around tenquot dr fletcher said quota group of us were leaving our function at the chart house and this feisty fellow was running around in the parking lot initially everyone assumed he escaped from one of the neighborhood yards or something but then someone noticed he was dragging a leash our friend went after him figuring someone had lost hold of him when he checked the tag what do you know our own griffey easterbrookquot the chart house sat just a couple of steep miles down from the easterbrook home the elegant restaurant was locate on the winding wooded section of taylors ferry road that ran from the modest burlingame neighborhood in southwest portland up about two miles to ohsu and then back down again into downtown portland spectacular views of the city made the route one of the most popular spots in the area for walks runs and bike rides it was not however the safest place for a woman alone at night about a year earlier two guys from the das office were taking a run there after work they heard what they thought was a couple goofing around behind the bushes a man wrestling his squealing wife or girlfriend to the grass fortunately the woman heard them talking as they ran past and yelled quothelp i dont know himquot the bad guy got away but the ensuing publicity had called the citys attention to the potential dangers of the area it was no longer common to find women alone on the path after dark the fletchers discovery of griffey there was not a good sign johnson mustve been thinking the same thing because he decided to revisit what i thought had been our mutual decision not to search the easterbrookjetson home he pulled me aside while townsend continued the conversation with the fletchers quoti know were playing it safe but finding the dog changes the picture we need to go through the place now while hes still playing victim if we wait until a body shows he might lawyer upquot i shook my head quoti still dont like itquot i said quotlook at him hes a basket case later on his state of mind might vitiate any consent we get from him if god forbid her body does surface we can easily get a warrant since this is her house we wont need to have probable cause against the husbandquot quotand what do we do about the fact that our doctor can move whatever he wants and start dumping evidence the minute were out of herequot johnsons point was well taken but it wasnt enough to justify a thorough search this early in the case not only could townsend try to throw out the search down the road wed pretty much be killing any chance we had of continued cooperation from him in any event if townsend was involved in his wifes disappearance he certainly could have disposed of any incriminating evidence before calling the police i explained my thinking to johnson and proposed a compromise quotwhy dont you offer to take a look around to make sure theres no sign of a breakin i dont have a problem with you doing a general walkthrough i just dont want a detailed search yet if you check for broken windows and the like we can at least look for the obvious and avoid any major fuckupsquot quotokay with you if i ask him about it in front of his buddiesquot i gave a quick nod if townsend felt pressured to consent to a search because his friends were around so be it courts only care about claims of involuntariness if the supposed coercion comes from law enforcement before johnson walked away i added quotwe should also get people searching up on taylors ferry hopefully by the time the department has a search plan together walker can tell us what she might have been wearingquot griffey perked up when tara came down the stairs apparently satisfied that nothing helpful was going to come from foraging through her sisters closet id already been positively disposed toward her based on her obvious concern for her sister and i warmed to her even more when she found the energy to get down on the floor with her sisters dog and comfort him with a bear hug after a few minutes spent on introductions to the fletchers and the inevitable words of comfort tara grew antsy again quotgriffey upquot she commanded pointing him toward the stairs quotsorry i cant sit still you mind if i throw him into the tub real quick town hes a little crunchy and itll give me something to doquot it was clear that taras nervous energy was grating on her brotherinlaw he seemed more at ease once shed followed griffey to the second floor and he could turn his attention back to the fletchers quoti keep expecting the phone to ring but im not sure exactly what kind of call it would be maybe a ransom demand or something obviously i want it to be clarissa explaining that this is all a misunderstanding that she went with a friend somewhere and forgot to leave a note and griffey just happened to get out quot he was just rambling i didnt point out that the leash suggested griffey had not simply escaped from the yard but that someone had been walking him townsend would come to the realizations in his own time i was beginning to think that a ransom demand would be good news at this point at least it might indicate that clarissa was alive quotthis lifestyle of oursquot townsend said looking around quotwhy does any of it really matter maybe it just invites problemsquot johnson used the moment as his in to ask permission for the walkthrough consistent with everything else about the man his transition was smooth he started by asking dr easterbrook if hed ever noticed anything that might suggest that someone was scoping out the house or following them perhaps planning a way to get to clarissa by herself quotno nothing at all like thatquot easterbrook replied quotthis neighborhood is so isolated up here we hardly see anyone on our street who doesnt live herequot quotcan you think of anyone who has a conflict with you of some kind someone who might be motivated to do something to scare you or retaliate against youquot quotwhy would someone hurt clarissa to get to me detectivequot quotjust exploring all possibilities doctor maybe a disgruntled patient from the hospital a former employeequot quotno quot townsend said slowly shaking his head quotclarissa would occasionally get some threats about her cases but she always assumed they were only blowing off steam never anything we considered seriously no one would want to hurt her shes such a good personquot quoti was just exploring all the possibilitiesquot johnson repeated quotcome to think of it we should probably take a look around and make sure theres no signs of a breakin just in case do you mindquot quotof course not but im sure i would have noticed something earlier given the security system i dont see how anyone could have gotten inquot quotas long as you dont mind ill go ahead and check it out no harm rightquot johnson sidled off before anyone might want to stop him and the fletchers seized the opportunity to extricate themselves from a situation where they knew they couldnt be of much help as they launched into their goodbyes feeding townsend more premature assurances that everything would be okay i caught up with ray truth was i didnt want to be alone with townsend struggling like the fletchers to avoid all those lame clichs this will all work out only a silly misunderstanding and other completely useless pronouncements suggesting the speaker had any clue as to how the night would end we hit the basement first my basement is a dark damp dusty wreck of concrete and cinder block that my imagination has populated with thousands of spiders and their cobwebs the easterbrooks had been finished into a laundry room and a home gym that had better equipment than my health club not only did we not fine any bodies blood or guts there werent even any windows to check in place of the flimsy things that are so often kicked in for basement breakins the easterbrooks had glass bricks climbing back up the stairs we could hear townsend letting the fletchers out the front door so we headed up to the second floor where tara had griffey in a bathroom off the main hallway she was fighting to get a dog brush through the hair on his hind leg predictably griffey stood compliantly while tara tried to avoid pulling his entire coat off by the roots she looked up at us from the tile floor removing her hand from the brush to push her bangs from her forehead the brush stayed entangled in poor griffeys coat quoti was just wondering whether i should show this to you i thought he felt a little crusty downstairs when i was petting him but it looks like hes actually got something dried on his coat back herequot johnson knelt down and looked more closely at the side of griffeys hip then he reached into an interior pocket of his suit jacket removed a latex glove and slipped it over his right hand quotdo you mind giving us a second ms carneyquot tara seemed surprised by the request but left the bathroom closing the door behind her quotlooks like clay or somethingquot johnson explained quotlike he brushed up against it here on his sidequot quotshit we should have gotten the crime lab over here immediately when the fletchers calledquot i was beginning to panic why the hell hadnt johnson been on top of this quotwasnt obviousquot he said responding to the unspoken question quotuntil youre certain what youre dealing with its hard to decide what kind of resources to put into it considering the small chance of any evidence off the dog plus the likelihood that were dealing with a runaway wife and its a tough callquot it made sense but it didnt excuse the fact that we nearly allowed tara carney to take what might be our best piece of evidence so far and soak him in a bathtub johnson flaked some of the beige paste from griffeys coat into an evidence bag then marked it with his name and the date using a sharpie pen shit what else had we missed quoti think we should go ahead and get the crime lab out here and search around taylors ferry everything about this feels badquot quotyour callquot he said pulling out his cell phone this new gig was going to take some getting used to
