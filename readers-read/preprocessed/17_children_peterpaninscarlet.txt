 im not going to bed said john which startled his wife children are never ready for bed but grownups like john are usually hankering for their pillows and eiderdowns from the moment they finish dinner im not going to bed said john again and so ferociously that his wife knew he was very frightened indeed you have been dreaming again havent you she said tenderly such a trial john scrubbed at his eyes with his knuckles i told you i never dream what does a man have to do to be believed in his own house his wife stroked his shiny head and went to turn down the bedclothes and there on johns side of the bed something bulged up through the coverlet it wasnt a hotwater bottle or a teddy bear or a library book mrs john folded down the sheets it was a cutlass with a sigh she hung it on the hook behind the bedroom door alongside the quiver of arrows and johns dressing gown both she and her husband liked to pretend it was not happening because thats what grownups do when they are in trouble but secretly they both knew john was dreaming of neverland again after every dream something was left behind in his bed next morning like the stones around a dish after a serving of prunes a sword here a candle there a bow a medicine bottle a top hatthe night after he dreamed of mermaids a fishy smell hung about the stairs all day the wardrobe was piled high with the dregs of dreams an alarm clock an indian headdress an eyepatch a pirates tricorn hat the worst nights were when john dreamed of captain hook mrs john plumped up the pillows with a brisk blow of her hand and a gunshot rang out through the whole house waking the neighbours and terrifying the dog the bullet shied about the room bouncing off the lampstand and smashing a vase cautiously with two fingers mrs john drew the pistol from under the pillow and dropped it into the bin like a kipper found to be not quite fresh they are so real whimpered her husband from the doorway these wretched dreams are just so real all over london and even as far afield as fotheringdene and grimswater old boys were dreaming the same kind of dreams not young silly boys but boys grownup cheerful stolid boys who worked in banks or drove trains or grew strawberries or wrote plays or stood for parliament cozy at home surrounded by family and friends they thought themselves comfortable and safeuntil the dreams began now each night they dreamed of neverland and woke to find leftovers in their beds daggers or coils of rope a pile of leaves or a hook and what did they have in common these dreamers just one thing they had all once been boys in neverland i have called you all together because something must be done said judge tootles twirling his big moustache it is not good enough gone on far too long wont do enough is enough we must act they were eating brown soup in the library of the gentlemens club off piccadilly a brown room with brown portraits of gentlemen wearing brown suits smoke from the fireplace hung in the air like a brown fog on the dining table lay an assortment of weapons the sole of a shoe a cap a pair of giant birds eggs the honourable slightly fingered them thoughtfully the flotsam of night washed up on the shores of morning he said but then the honourable slightly played the clarinet in a nightclub and was inclined to write poetry call mrs wendy mrs wendy would know what to do said judge tootles but of course wendy had not been invited because ladies are not allowed in the gentlemens club i say we should let sleeping dogs lie said mr nibs but nobody thanked him because dogs are not allowed in the gentlemens club either mind over matter exclaimed mr john we must just try harder not to dream we tried that said the twins mournfully stayed awake all night for a week and what happened asked mr john intrigued we fell asleep on the london omnibus on the way to work and dreamed all the way to putney when we got off we were both wearing warpaint how perfectly charming said the honourable slightly last night we dreamed of the lagoon added second twin there was a murmur of heartfelt sighs each of the old boys had dreamed lately of the lagoon and woken with wet hair and dazzle in his eyes is there a cure curly enquired mr nibs but dr curly knew of no cure for an outbreak of unwanted dreams we should write a letter of complaint boomed judge tootles but nobody knew of a ministry for dreams or whether there was a minister of state for nightmares in the end with nothing solved and no plan of campaign the old boys sank into silence and fell asleep in their armchairs their brown coffee cups dropping brown drips onto the brown carpet and they all dreamed the same dream they dreamed they were playing tag with the mermaids while the reflections of rainbows twisted around and between them like water snakes then from somewhere deeper down and darker came a hugely slithering shape that brushed the soles of their feet with its knobbly scaly hide when they woke the old boys clothes were sopping wet and there on its back in the middle of the gentlemens library was a prodigious crocodile lashing its tail and snapping its jaws in an effort to turn over and make supper of them the gentlemens club emptied in the record time of fortythree seconds and next day members everywhere received a letter from the management the gentlemens club brown street off piccadilly london w1 23rd april 1926 we regret to inform you that the club will be closed for redecoration from 23rd april until approximately 1999 your obedient servants the management in the end of course it was mrs wendy who explained it dreams are leaking out of neverland she said something must be wrong if we want the dreams to stop we must find out what mrs wendy was a grown woman and as sensible as can be she had a tidy mind for six days in any week she strongly disapproved of dreams littering up the house but on the seventh she was not quite so sure recently she had begun hurrying to bed eager for that twilight flicker that comes between waking and sleep from behind closed eyelids she would watch for a dream to come floating towards her just as once she had watched at her bedroom window hoping against hope for a small figure to come swooping through the local stars each bedtime her heart beat faster at the thought of glimpsing the lagoon again or hearing the cry of the neverbird above all she longed to see peter again the friend she had left behind in neverland all those years before now neverland was rubbing against the here and now wearing holes in the fabric in between tendrils of dream were starting to poke through all was not well somehow mrs wendy knew it perhaps the dreams are messages said one twin perhaps they are warnings said the other perhaps they are symptoms said dr curly putting his stethoscope to his own forehead and listening for the dreams inside im awfully afraid they may be said wendy something is wrong in neverland gentlemenand that is why we must go back
