 one it will all be over soon julia cates had lost count of the times shed told herself that very thing but todayfinallyit would be true in a few hours the world would know the truth about her if she made it downtown that was unfortunately the pacific coast highway looked more like a parking lot than a freeway the hills behind malibu were on fire again smoke hung above the rooftops and turned the normally bright coastal air into a thick brown sludge all over town terrified babies woke in the middle of the night crying grayblack tears and gasping for breath even the surf seemed to have slowed down as if exhausted by the unseasonable heat she maneuvered through the cranky stopandgo traffic ignoring the drivers who flipped her off and cut in front of her it was expected in this most dangerous of seasons in southern california tempers caught fire as easily as backyards the heat made everyone edgy finally she exited the freeway and drove to the courthouse television vans were everywhere dozens of reporters huddled on the courthouse steps microphones and cameras at the ready waiting for the story to arrive in los angeles it was becoming a daily event it seemed legal proceedings as entertainment michael jackson courtney love robert blake julia turned a corner and drove to a side entrance where her lawyers were waiting for her she parked on the street and got out of the car expecting to move forward confidently but for a terrible second she couldnt move youre innocent she reminded herself theyll see that the system will work she forced herself to take a step then another it felt as if she were moving through invisible wires fighting her way uphill when she made it to the group it took everything she had to smile but one thing she knew it looked real every psychiatrist knew how to make a smile look genuine quothello dr catesquot said frank williams the lead counsel on her defense team quothow are youquot quotlets goquot she said wondering if she was the only one who heard the wobble in her voice she hated that evidence of her fear today of all days she needed to be strong to show the world that she was the doctor theyd thought she was that shed done nothing wrong the team coiled protectively around her she appreciated their support although she was doing her best to appear professional and confident it was a fragile veneer one wrong word could strip it all away they pushed through the doors and walked into the courthouse flashbulbs erupted in spasms of bluewhite light cameras clicked tape rolled reporters surged forward all yelling at once quotdr cates how do you feel about what happenedquot quotwhy didnt you save those childrenquot quotdid you know about the gunquot frank put an arm around julia and pulled her against his side she pressed her face against his lapel and let herself be pulled along in the courtroom she took her place at the defendants table one by one the team rallied around her behind her in the first row of gallery seating several junior associates and paralegals took their places she tried to ignore the racket behind her the doors creaking open and slamming shut footsteps hurrying across the marble tiled floor whispered voices empty seats were filling up quickly she knew it without turning around this courtroom was the place to be in los angeles today and since the judge had disallowed cameras in the courtroom journalists and artists were no doubt packed side by side in the gallery their pens ready in the past year theyd written an endless string of stories about her photographers had snapped thousands of pictures of hertaking out the trash standing on her deck coming and going from her office the least flattering shots always made the front page reporters had practically set up camp outside her condo and although she had never spoken to them it didnt matter the stories kept coming they reported on her smalltown roots her stellar education her pricey beachfront condo her devastating breakup with philip they even speculated that shed recently become either anorexic or addicted to liposuction what they didnt report on was the only part of her that mattered her love of her job she had been a lonely awkward child and she remembered every nuance of that pain her own youth had made her an exceptional psychiatrist of course that bit of truth had never made it to press neither had a list of all the children and adolescents shed helped a hush fell over the courtroom as judge carol myerson took her seat at the bench she was a sternlooking woman with artificially bright auburn hair and oldfashioned eyeglasses the bailiff called out the case julia wished suddenly that she had asked someone to join her here today some friend or relative who would stand by her maybe hold her hand when it was over but shed always put work ahead of socializing it hadnt given her much time to devote to friends her own therapist had often pointed out this lack in her life truthfully until now shed never agreed with him beside her frank stood he was an imposing man tall and almost elegantly thin with hair that was going from black to gray in perfect order sideburns first shed chosen him because of his brilliant mind but his demeanor was likely to matter more too often in rooms like this it came down to form over substance quotyour honorquot he began in a voice as soft and persuasive as any shed ever heard quotthe naming of dr julia cates as a defendant in this lawsuit is absurd although the precise limits and boundaries of confidentiality in psychiatric situations are often disputed certain precedents exist namely tarasoff v regents of university of california dr cates had no knowledge of her patients violent tendencies and no information regarding specific threats to named individuals indeed no such specific knowledge is even alleged in the complaint thus we respectfully request that she be dismissed from this lawsuit thank youquot he sat down at the plaintiffs table a man in a jetblack suit stood up quotfour children are dead your honor they will never grow up never leave for college never have children of their own dr cates was amber zunigas psychiatrist for three years dr cates spent two hours a week with amber listening to her problems and prescribing medications for her growing depression yet with all that intimacy we are now to believe that dr cates didnt know that amber was becoming increasingly violent and depressed that she had no warning whatsoever that her patient would buy an automatic weapon and walk into her church youth group meeting and start shootingquot the lawyer walked out from behind the table and stood in the middle of the courtroom slowly he turned to face julia it was the money shot the one that would be drawn by every artist in the courtroom and shown around the world quotshe is the expert your honor she should have foreseen this tragedy and prevented it by warning the victims or committing ms zuniga for residential treatment if she didnt in fact know of ms zunigas violent tendencies she should have thus we respectfully seek to keep dr cates as a named defendant in this case it is a matter of justice the slain childrens families deserve redress from the person most likely to have foreseen and prevented the murder of their childrenquot he went back to the table and took his seat quotit isnt truequot julia whispered knowing her voice couldnt be heard still she had to say it out loud amber had never even hinted at violence every teenager battling depression said they hated the kids in their school that was lightyears away from buying a gun and opening fire why couldnt they all see that judge myerson read over the paperwork in front of her then she took off her reading glasses and set them down on the hard wooden surface of her bench the courtroom fell into silence julia knew that the journalists were ready to write instantly outside there were more of them standing by ready to run with two stories both headlines were already written all they needed was a sign from their colleagues inside the childrens parents huddled in the back rows in a mournful group were waiting to be assured that this tragedy could have been averted that someone in a position of authority could have kept their children alive they had sued everyone for wrongful deaththe police the paramedics the drug manufacturers the medical doctors and the zuniga family the modern world no longer believed in senseless tragedy bad things couldnt just happen to people someone had to pay the victims families hoped that this lawsuit would be the answer but julia knew it would only give them something else to think about for a while perhaps distribute some of their pain it wouldnt alleviate it though the grief would outlive them all the judge looked at the parents first quotthere is no doubt that what happened on february nineteenth at the baptist church in silverwood was a terrible tragedy as a parent myself i cannot fathom the world in which you have lived for the past months however the question before this court is whether dr cates should remain a defendant in this casequot she folded her hands on the desk quoti am persuaded that as a matter of law dr cates had no duty to warn or otherwise protect the victims in this set of circumstances i reach this conclusion for several reasons first the facts do not assert and the plaintiffs do not allege that dr cates had any specific knowledge of identifiable potential victims second the law does not impose a duty to warn except to clearly identifiable victims and finally as a matter of public policy we must maintain the confidentiality of the psychiatristpatient relationship unless there is a specific identifiable threat which warrants the undermining of that confidentiality dr cates by her testimony and her records and pursuant to the plaintiffs own assertions did not have a duty to warn or otherwise protect the victims in this case thus i am dismissing her from the complaint without prejudicequot the gallery went crazy before she knew it julia was on her feet and enfolded in congratulatory hugs by her defense team behind her she could hear the journalists running for the doors and down the marble hallway quotshes outquot someone yelled julia felt a wave of relief thank god then she heard the childrens parents crying behind her quothow can this be happeningquot one of them said loudly quotshe should have knownquot frank touched her arm quotyou should be smiling we wonquot she shot a quick glance at the parents then looked away her thoughts trailed off into the dark woods of regret were they right should she have known quotit wasnt your fault and its time you told people that this is your opportunity to speak up toquot a crowd of reporters swarmed them quotdr cates what do you have to say to the parents who hold you responsiblequot quotwill other parents trust you with their childrenquot quotcan you comment on the report that the los angeles district attorneys office has taken your name off the roster of forensic psychiatristsquot frank stepped into the fray reaching back for julias hand quotmy client was just released from the lawsuitquot quoton a technicalityquot someone yelled while they were focused on frank julia slipped to the back of the crowd and ran for the door she knew frank wanted her to make a statement but she didnt care she didnt feel triumphant all she wanted was to be away from all this to get back to real life the zunigas were standing in front of the door blocking her path they were paler versions of the couple shed once known grief had stripped them of color and aged them mrs zuniga looked up at her through tears quotshe loved both of youquot julia said softly knowing it wasnt enough quotand you were good parents dont let anyone convince you otherwise amber was ill i wishquot quotdontquot mr zuniga said quotwishing hurts most of allquot he put an arm around his wife and drew her close to him silence fell between them julia tried to think of more to say but all that was left was im sorry which shed said too many times to count and quotgoodbyequot holding her purse close she eased around them then left the courthouse outside the world was brown and bleak a thick layer of smoke darkened the sky obliterating the sun matching her mood she got into her car and drove away as she merged into traffic she wondered if frank had even noticed her absence to him it was a game albeit with the biggest stakes and as the days winner he would be flying high he would think about the victims and their families probably tonight in his den after a few dewars over ice he would think about her too perhaps wonder what would become of a psychiatrist whod so profoundly compromised her reputation with failure but he wouldnt think about them all for long he didnt dare she was going to have to put it behind her now too tonight shed lay in her lonely bed listening to the surf thinking how much it sounded like the beat of her heart and shed try again to get beyond her grief and guilt she had to figure out what clue shed missed what sign shed overlooked it would hurtrememberingbut in the end shed be a better therapist for all this pain and then at seven oclock in the morning shed get dressed and go back to work helping people that was how shed get through this girl crouches at the edge of the cave watching water fall from the sky she wants to reach for one of the empty cans around her maybe lick the insides again but she has done this too many times already the food is gone it has been gone for more moons than she knows how to keep track of behind her the wolves are restless hungry the sky grumbles and roars the trees shake with fear and still the water drips down she falls asleep she wakes suddenly and looks around sniffing the air there is a strange scent in the darkness it should frighten her send her back into the deep black hole but she cant quite move her stomach is so tight and empty it hurts the falling water isnt so angry now it is more of a spitting she wishes she could see the sun
