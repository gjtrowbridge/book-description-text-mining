if i wanted to be hot8221 i said to leo walsh 8220i8217d go to hell in a handcart there8217s no reason why it should be ninetyfour degrees in alpine even in august8221 leo gave me his offcenter grin 8220you could always take a couple of weeks off and visit adam in alaska i8217ll bet it8217s not ninetyfour at st mary8217s igloo8221 8220i8217ll bet it isn8217t either8221 i grumbled from across the desk in the cubbyhole that was my office but felt more like a pizza oven even at eleven in the morning to think i was sorry for my son adam when his first assignment as a priest sent him up to the frozen north now i envy him 8220when will it ever rain everything is tinderdry leo it8217s a wonder the woods don8217t explode8221 8220they did8221 my ad manager said in his usual wry manner 8220or haven8217t you been checking the ap wire this morning8221 8220i have8221 i retorted 8220i mean all the woods not the ones burning up in eastern washington and other parts of the west grass fires too not to mention that water and power rates are going to skyrocket because we haven8217t had enough rain let alone snow8221 8220why don8217t you write an editorial taking a tough stand against hot weather8221 leo inquired reasonably 8220maybe you can change it8221 i glared at him 8220that8217s not funny nothing8217s funny in this heat8221 8220come on emma8221 leo said no longer smiling 8220at least western washington8217s not humid like the midwest or the eastern seaboard dry heat8217s not as bad i worked on a newspaper in palm desert where it was over a hundred and twenty degrees for a week8221 8220no wonder you drank8221 i snarled 8220besides people from southern california deserve to be hot native pacific northwesterners like me don8217t8221 leo took no offense at my remark we8217d known each other too long and too well not to be able to speak candidly he merely sighed his wellworn face showed the ravages of his former bouts with the bottle in my heatcrazed state i decided that he8217d also spent too much time in the sun 8220mad dogs and californians 8221 i muttered 8220quit bitching and just look at the ad layout8221 leo finally said tapping the grocery basket8217s mockup on my desk 8220jake o8217toole went over it with a finetoothed thesaurus what gets into that guy wanting to use all those big words that half the time aren8217t what he really means8221 8220heat8221 i said 8220he8217s a native too8221 8220knock it off8221 leo retorted temporarily forgetting that i was the boss 8220jake8217s been doing it forever when he talks but he started in with the grocery ads back in april unsullied for fresh tomatoes temperate for tender pork chops un skeletal for boneless chicken breasts i8217m not even sure unskeletal is a word8221 at last i scanned the layout 8220you8217re right it8217s stupid jake should stop trying to show off especially when he doesn8217t know what he8217s talking about it might be a midlife crisis maybe i8217ll talk to betsy his wife8217s a sensible woman8221 8220go for it8221 leo urged standing up 8220i8217m changing this damned thing8221 he cocked his head 8220with your approval of course8221 8220of course8221 leo knew he didn8217t need my approval which i suppose was why he occasionally forgot that i was the alpine advocate8217s editor and publisher he did an excellent job about fifty rungs above the lugubrious and lazy ed bronsky a leftover ad manager from marius vandeventer8217s ownership 8220lugubrious8221 i said and managed a smile 8220huh8221 layout in hand leo turned around to look back at me 8220the header for the grocery ad is 8216lazy days of summer8217 it8217s a wonder jake didn8217t ask you to put in lugubrious8221 leo grinned again 8220he did8212sort of only he wanted to use lubricious8221 i nodded 8220he would8221 8220would what8221 vida runkel inquired leo made way for her semimajestic passage into my cubbyhole then left 8220oh goodness it8217s even warmer in here than it is in the newsroom why didn8217t kip put a vent in this low ceiling when he repaired the roof after the big storm8221 i remembered the punishing rain and windstorm of eighteen months ago with nostalgia 8220because i8217m an idiot8221 i told my house amp home editor vida who was wearing a sleeveless red and white print dress that resembled a bedspread eased her imposing body into one of the two visitor chairs 8220would what8221 she repeated i recounted leo8217s misadventures with jake o8217toole vida shook her head the unruly gray curls were already damp around the edges 8220jake hasn8217t been himself lately8221 she declared 8220it8217s much more than his pretentious8212if often inaccurate8212language he and betsy have stopped fighting in public8221 8220really8221 i was surprised the o8217tooles who had been married forever were famous for bickering in front of other people but in fact they were a devoted couple who used their often heated exchanges as a sort of lovemaking 8220do you think they8217re having problems8221 vida would know she knew everything that went on in alpine she gave me a quizzical look from behind her bigframed glasses 8220i don8217t really think so it has more to do with the store staff i8217d guess jake8217s had to fire at least two of his courtesy clerks in the past month high school students you know and quite irresponsible and of course there8217s always buzzy8221 buzzy was jake8217s younger brother who had had a somewhat checkered career until he finally went to work for the grocery basket as the produce manager 8220what8217s wrong with buzzy now8221 i asked 8220now8221 vida pursed her lips 8220i honestly don8217t know it might be trouble at home with laura the only thing i8217ve heard for certain is that buzzy had a row with their peach supplier and that he ordered ugli fruit which no one in alpine would dream of eating because it8217s so ugly it all rotted in the bins i was tempted to mention it in my column but i didn8217t want to hurt the o8217tooles8217 feelings8221 i was dubious vida didn8217t usually worry about hurting other people8217s feelings being extremely outspoken in her criticism of fellow alpiners the o8217tooles however were big advertisers buying a twopage color insert to compete with the regionally produced ads of their archrival safeway 8220which reminds me8221 vida went on 8220have you a 8216scene8217 item i only need two more for this week8217s edition8221 i tried to put my heathazed brain to work 8220scene around town8221 was vida8217s popular frontpage column fea turing snippets of local happenings involving usually nonnewsworthy events such as dutch bamberg8217s lawn mower accidentally executing a hapless frog edna mae dalrymple discovering fudge smudges on a cookbook that had been returned to the local library or darla puckett8217s zany adventures at the home depot8217s faucet fixtures section in monroe 8220rip ridley8217s growing a beard8221 i finally said 8220i saw him at the alpine mall yesterday8221 vida gaped at me 8220impossible the high school would never allow a faculty member to have facial hair except8221 she added more softly 8220for effie trews but she can8217t help it8221 8220school hasn8217t started8221 i pointed out 8220rip swears he won8217t shave until the football team wins its first game this season8221 8220oh dear8221 vida sighed 8220he could end up looking like santa claus principal freeman will make the coach shave before school starts which reminds me8212i saw old nick saturday morning imagine8221 for a moment i was puzzled 8220old nick8221 then before vida could respond i remembered 8220you mean that hermit who lives someplace near sawyer creek8221 8220some place8221 vida said wryly 8220no one has ever been certain i don8217t think he8217s been seen in town for several years frankly i thought he was dead8221 hermits weren8217t uncommon in the forests of western washington most were harmless though some could be dangerous they8217d fled civilization for various reasons like monks going off to the desert a few would show up in town a couple of times a year to buy beg or steal supplies but old nick was rarely seen indeed in all of my thirteen years of alpine residence i8217d never sighted him 8220i8217ll put him in 8216scene8217 8221 vida declared 8220that should fill up the column unless something more gossipworthy comes up between now and tomorrow8217s deadline8221 my eyes had strayed into the newsroom 8220something just came in8221 i groaned 8220ed bronsky8221 8220oh dear8221 vida exclaimed 8220we8217re trapped8221 8220you8217re not8221 i whispered as ed rumbled toward my office 8220go or else there won8217t be enough air in here for the three of us to breathe8221 8220plenty of hot air8221 vida murmured hurriedly getting out of the chair 8220why ed what a surprise i was just leaving so was emma8221 bless vida 8220bad timing8221 i said forcing a smile 8220is there something you8217d like to drop off ed8221 like about a hundred pounds of excess weight 8220hey hey hey8221 ed enthused 8220it8217s more than a news brief it8217s frontpage stuff you8217d better hold up vida you won8217t want to miss this8221 vida frowned at her watch 8220i8217m afraid i8217ll have to i8217m already running late for my eleventhirty appointment emma can fill me in later8221 with a pitying glance in my direction vida exited my office in her splayfooted manner ed plopped down in the chair next to the one that vida had vacated he was wearing a yellow tank top and khaki shorts a most unflattering look but the only thing that would have covered ed8217s rotund form was a quonset hut 8220who8217s reporting on tonight8217s county commissioners8217 meeting8221 he asked removing a folder from his leather briefcase 8220scott chamoud8221 i replied referring to my only news reporter 8220he always does8221 ed shook his head 8220you8217d better do it emma huge news8221 he placed the folder on my desk and tapped it three times 8220i8217m going for a county bond issue8221 8220you8217re what8221
