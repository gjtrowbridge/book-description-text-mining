 candy had always prided herself upon having a vivid imagination when for instance she privately compared her dreams with those her brothers described over the breakfast table or her friends at school exchanged at break she always discovered her own night visions were a lot wilder and weirder than anybody elses but there was nothing she could remember dreaming by day or night that came close to the sight that greeted her in the great head of the yebba dim day it was a city a city built from the litter of the sea the street beneath her feet was made from timbers that had clearly been in the water for a long time and the walls were lined with barnacleencrusted stone there were three columns supporting the roof made of coral fragments cemented together they were buzzing hives of life unto themselves their elaborately constructed walls pierced with dozens of windows from which light poured there were three main streets that wound up and around these coral hives and they were all lined with habitations and thronged with the yebba dim days citizens as far as candy could see there were plenty of people who resembled folks she might have expected to see on the streets of chickentown give or take a sartorial detail a hat a coat a wooden snout but for every one person that looked perfectly human there were two who looked perfectly other than human the children of a thousand marriages between humankind and the great bestiary of the abarat were abroad on the streets of the city among those who passed her as she ventured up the street were creatures which seemed related to fish to birds to cats and dogs and lions and toads and those were just the species she recognized there were many more she did not forms of face that her dreamlife had never come near to showing her though she was cold she didnt care though she was weary to her marrow and lost oh so very lost she didnt care this was a new world rising before her and it was filled with every kind of diversity a beautiful woman walked by wearing a hat like an aquarium in it was a large fish whose poignant expression bore an uncanny resemblance to the woman on whose head it was balanced a man half candys size ran by with a second man half the first fellows size sitting in the hood of his robe throwing nuts into the air a creature with red ladders for legs was stalking its way through the crowd farther up the street its enormous coxcomb bright orange a cloud of blue smoke blew by and as it passed a foggy face appeared in the cloud and smiled at candy before the wind dispersed it everywhere she looked there was something to amaze besides the citizens there were countless animals in the city wild and domesticated whitefaced monkeys like troupes of clowns were on the roofs baring their scarlet bottoms to passersby beasts the size of chinchillas but resembling golden lions ran back and forth along the power cables looped between the houses while a snake pure white but for its turquoise eyes wove cunningly between the feet of the crowd chattering like an excited parrot to her left a thing that might have had a lobster for a mother and picasso for a father was clinging to a wall drawing a flattering selfportrait on the white plaster with a stick of charcoal to her right a man with a firebrand was trying to persuade a cow with an infestation of yellow grasshoppers leaping over its body to get out of his house the grasshoppers werent the only insects in the city far from it the air was filled with buzzing life high overhead birds dined on clouds of mites that blazed like pinpricks of fire butterflies the size of candys hand moved just above the heads of the crowd and now and then alighted on a favored head as though it were a flower some were transparent their veins running with brilliant blue blood others were fleshy and fat these the preferred food of a creature that was a decadently designed as a peacock its body vestigial its tail vast painted with colors for which candy had no name and on all sides among these astonishments were things that were absurdly recognizable televisions were on in many of the houses their screens visible through undraped windows a cartoon boy was tapdancing on one screen singing some sentimental song on another and on a third a number of wrestlers fought humans matched with enormous striped insects that looked thoroughly bored with the proceedings there was much else that candy recognized the smell of burned meat and spilled beer the sound of boys fighting laughter like any other laughter tears like any other tears to her amazement she heard english spoken everywhere though there were dozens of dialects and of course the mouth parts that delivered the words also went some way to shape the nature of the english that was being spoken some of it was high and nasal a singsong variation that almost seemed about to become music from other directions came a guttural version that descended at times into growls and yappings all this and she had advanced perhaps fifty yards in the yebba dim day the houses at the lower end of the great head where she was presently walking were all red their fronts bowed she quickly grasped why they were made of boats or the remains of boats to judge by the nets that were hung as makeshift doors the occupants of these houses were the families of fishermen whod settled here theyd dragged their vessels out of the cool evening air and taken a hammer and crowbar to the cabins and the deck and hold peeling apart the boards so as to make some kind of habitation on land there was no order to any of this people just seemed to take whatever space was available how else to explain the chaotic arrangement of vessels one on top of the other as for power it seemed to be nakedly stolen from those higher up in the city and therefore presumably more wealthy cables ran down the walls entering houses and exiting again to provide service for the next house it was not a foolproof system by any means at any one moment looking up at the hundreds perhaps thousands of heapedup houses somebodys lights were flickering or there was an argument going on about the cables no doubt the presence of monkeys and birds pecking at the cables or simply swinging from them did not improve matters it was a wonder candy thought that this outlandish collection of people animals and habitations worked at all she could not imagine the people of chickentown putting up with such chaotic diversity what would they think of the ladderlegged creature or the smoke creature or the baby beast throwing nuts in the air i need to remember as many details as i can so when i get back home i can tell everybody what it was like down to the last brick the last butterfly i wonder she thought to herself if they make cameras here if they have televisions she reasoned then surely they have cameras of course shed first have to find out if the few soaked and screwedup dollars she had in the bottom of her pocket were worth anything here if they were and she could find somewhere to purchase a camera then she could make a proper record of what she was seeing they shed have proof absolute proof that this place with all its wonders existed are you cold the woman who had addressed her looked as though she might have some seaskipper in her heritage vestigial gills ran from the lower half of her cheek into her neck and there was a faintly mottled quality to her skin her eyes had a subtle cast of silver about them actually i am a little candy said come with me im izarith im candy quackenbush im new here yes i could tell izarith said its cold today the water gets up through the stones one day this place is just going to rot and collapse on itself that would be a pity candy said you dont live here izarith said with a trace of bitterness she led candy to one of the houses made from fishing boats as she followed the woman to the threshold candy felt just a little pang of doubt why was she being invited into izariths house so quickly without any real reason beyond that of a strangers generosity izarith seemed to sense her unease dont come in if you dont want to she said i just thought you looked in need of a fire to warm you through before candy could reply there was a series of crashes from outside the head accompanied by a din of yells and screams the dock candy said looking back toward the door obviously the jetty had finally given out beneath the weight of the crowd there was a great rush of people out to see the calamity which was of course only going to make matters worse out there izarith showed no desire to go and see what had happened she just said are you coming yes said candy offering the woman a smile of thanks and following her inside just as izarith had promised there was a fire in the little hearth which the woman fuelled with a handful of what looked like dried seaweed the kindling was consumed quickly and brightly a soothing wave of warmth hit candy oh thats nice she said warming her hands on the floor in front of the fire was a child of perhaps two her features one generation further removed from the seadwelling origins of her grandparents or perhaps her greatgreatgrandparents this is maiza maiza this is candy say hello hell o said maiza with her duty to courtesy done maiza returned to playing with her toys which were little more than painted blocks of wood one of them was a boat painted red a crude copy perhaps of the vessel whose boards had built these walls izarith went to check on the other child in the room a baby asleep in a cot thats nazreacute she said hes been sick since we came here he was born at sea and i believe he wants to go back there she bent low talking softly to the baby thats what you want isnt it dearling you want to be out away from here you want that too candy said with all my heart i hate this place cant you leave izarith shook her head my husband ruthus had a boat and we used to fish around the outer islands where the shoals are still good but the boat was getting old so we came here to trade it in for a new one we had some money from the seasons fishing and we thought wed be able to get a good boat but there were no new boats to be had nobodys building anymore and now were almost out of money so my husbands working putting in toilets for the folks in the towers and im stuck down here with the children as she told her tale she pulled back a makeshift curtain which divided the little room in two and sorting through a box of garments she selected a simple dress which she gave to candy here she said put this on if you wear those wet clothes much longer youll get phlegmatic gratefully candy put it on feeling secretly ashamed of her initial suspicion izarith obviously had a good heart she had very little to share but what she had she was offering it suits you izarith said as candy tied a simple rope belt around her waist the fabric of the dress was brown but it had a subtle iridescence to it a hint of blue and silver in its weave whats the currency here candy asked plainly izarith was surprised by the question understandably so but she answered anyway its a zem she said or a paterzem which is a hundred zem note oh why do you ask this question candy dug in the pocket of her jeans its just that i have some dollars she said you have dollars izarith replied her mouth wide in astonishment yes a few candy pulled the sodden notes out and carefully spread them on the hearth where they steamed in front of the fire izariths eyes didnt leave the bills from the moment they appeared it was almost as though she was witnessing a miracle where did you get those she said her voice breathless with astonishment finally she tore her gaze from the hearth and looked up at candy wait she said is it possible is what possible do you come from the hereafter candy nodded actually i come from a place called america america izarith spoke the word like a prayer you have dollars and you come from america she shook her head in disbelief candy went down on her haunches before the fire and peeled the now almost dried dollars off the hearth here she said offering them to izarith you have them izarith shook her head her expression one of religious awe no no i couldnt not dollars angels use dollars not skizmut like me take it from me candy said im not an angel very far from it and whats a skizmut my people are skizmut or they were generations ago the bloodlines been diluted over the years you have to go back to my greatgrandfather for a pure skizmut she looked melancholy an expression which suited the form of her face better than any other why so sad i just wish i could go back into the deeps and make my home there away from all this izarith cast her sad eyes toward the window which was without frames or panes the crowd outside moved like a relentless parade candy could see how hard it would be to exist in this tiny hovel with the twilight throng moving up and down the street outside all the hours that god sent when you say the deeps candy replied do you mean the sea yes mama izabella the skizmut had cities down there deep in the ocean beautiful cities made of white stone have you ever seen them no of course not after two generations you lose the way of the fish i would drown like you so what can you do live on a boat as close as we can to the deeps live with the rhythm of mother izabella beneath us well perhaps the dollars will help you and ruthus buy a boat candy said candy handed izarith a ten and one single keeping six for herself izarith laughed out loud the music in her laughter so infectious that her daughter maiza started laughing too eleven dollars eleven it would buy two boats three boats its like eleven paterzem more i think she looked up suddenly anxious and this is really for me she said as though she was afraid the gift would be reclaimed its all yours candy said feeling a little odd about sounding too magnanimous after all it was only eleven bucks im going to spend a little piece of this one izarith said selecting a single and pocketing the rest im going to buy some food the children havent eaten this day i think you havent either her eyes were shining their joy increased by the silvery luster that was the gift of her skizmut breeding will you stay with them while i go out she said of course candy said she suddenly realized she was starving and maiza yes muma will you be kind to the lady from the hereafter while i fetch bread and milk grish fritters said maiza is that what you want grish fritters with noga seeds grish fritter with noga seeds grish fritter with noga seeds i wont be long izarith said well be fine candy said sitting down beside the child in front of the fire wont we maiza the child smiled again her tiny teeth semitranslucent carrying a hint of blue grish fritters with noga seeds she said all for me
