 chapter 1 dont stop believing they called her star her best friend theresa had started it after theyd seen that old barbra streisand movie a star is born when it had come on the late show on one of the two miami channels they could pick up on arcady key theyd been having a sleepover at theresas and both girls had fallen hard for the overthetop rockstar romance when ms streisands character explained that her name esther meant star in hebrew wellthat was pretty much all it took esther wood leigh was instantly commissioned star the name stuck for good reason there was just something about her it had begun the minute she was born the first baby of the new year her arrival had been announced in all the papers as if she were heir to a throne or a fortune instead of the daughter of a sometime fisherman and fulltime gambler and the best waitress at the garden cove pancake house on us 1 she just naturally attracted extra attention it wasnt that star was the prettiest she was kind of a late bloomer the type of girl whose natural athletic abilities and aversion to all things girlie made her more tomboy than homecoming queen but when it was time to decide who would be captain of the volleyball team or class officer or the one youd tell your troubles to it was always star people felt comfortable around her relaxed and at home maybe that was why they tended to underestimate her like school for example she may have been the brightest but she was far more likely to be called on for cutting up in class than for giving the correct answer only her mom knew about the straight as and that was because she signed the report cards star never told despite her stellar performance in school and her place in the hearts of all those who knew her star had been unable to afford college and tried hard to make her place in the world shed moved the few miles up the coast from arcady key to miami where she shared a tiny apartment with theresa the friend who named her little by little she was saving up enough money for formal cosmetology training so she could earn some real money burning hair at a nice salon as she made her way up the dixie highway from her day job at talons nail and tan spa to her night job at mother pearls steak and oyster emporium two rarely seen creases appeared between her brows she worked hard two jobs took most of her time and the few hours she didnt spend working were filled by constant activity with her friends and her boyfriend adam it wasnt that the work bothered her or that shed have traded in a single volleyball game beach party bar crawl or wild night at adams apartment it was a spider sense that something was missing like that feeling you get when you stand looking into the refrigerator not really hungry but unable to stop looking the feeling that this time it might be there right behind the ketchup and the pickled beets talons had been particularly trying that day miss elliott the rather terrifying eurasian mistress of the establishment whod taught star everything she knew about nails was breaking up with her cuban boyfriend adolpho all day in between monsoonsized crying jags the scissors hadnt been sharp enough the nail polish had been sorted wrong the tan accelerator wasnt stocked right and the tanning beds werent clean enough go home and call in sick had been stars advice to trudy the secondshift girl when she arrived as star caught the long light at calle ocho she began changing into her uniform for mother pearls the uniform and the girls all laughed at the word was a pair of silky pearlcolored onionskin running shorts white crosstrainers a pair of lighttoast danskin shimmery tights and a tootight tshirt with shuck me suck me eat me raw emblazoned in red across the front mothers made almost as much from the sale of the tshirts as from the oysters and star did her part to sell the shirts she may have been a late bloomer but when she did finally bloom it was with a vengeance star was used to the boys teasing nickname pirates favorite code for sunken chest since she could take most of the boys in her class best two falls out of three the teasing was always goodnatured for her part star was perfectly content to be mvp and couldnt really see what all the fuss was about anyway and then came puberty the onset was so abrupt that it frightened her all she knew was that one day there was a lump on the right side convinced she was dying of cancer star took the bus to the broad key public library and confirmed her worst suspicions the bus ride home was long and it took her all evening to get up the nerve to break the sad news to her mother mom shed said quietly sticking her head in her parents bedroom door can i talk to you a minute what is it honey lucille leigh said looking up from her stephen king novel you look like someone licked all the red off your candy she patted the bed beside her the tears came even before star got the words out of her mouth she piled onto the bed beside her mother and buried her face in lucilles ample bosom honey lucille said stroking her daughters hair whats wrong ii founda lump star managed to choke out a lump lucille asked confused right here star took her mothers hand and placed in on the poisonous node i think its cancer oh lucille said drawing back suddenly and laughing as she wrapped her arms around her beloved daughter well well well she said rocking star gently youre not dying youre just growing up looks like youre finally going to get some boobs youre becoming a woman honey youre blooming and bloom she did her breasts came on suddenly and tenaciously as if trying to make up for lost time the hard bump turned out to be one of a pair of unruly and selfwilled nipples and the boys teasing quickly took a very different form as star finished getting ready for work and her head popped through the tee she came facetoface with a gentleman in a nearby pickup truck they exchanged a smile as the light changed he made the left and they went their separate ways maybe she should move back in with her parents she could save more money that way she figured besides she spent more time in the car than anywhere else her trusty old chevy impala star called him rusty for obvious reasons was a combination office dressingroom beautytech and petrescue van it was filled with pet treats animal carriers a wide supply of nail hair and beauty products outfits for every occasion volleyballs net and boundary ropes and a collection of petrified flower arrangements from her boyfriend adam there was his im sorry bouquet from earlier in the week that hung from the rearview mirror his i forgot your birthday nosegay that was relegated to the passengerside footwell and in the place of supreme honor the hat shelf above the backseat his wellmummified will you marry me arrangement adam had gone all out with that one it looked as if it might have been boosted from a gangsters gravesite maybe that was it maybe she should marry adam he was a sweet guy when he wanted to be goodlooking drove a hot firebird that was practically brandnew and already paid for from his successful career marketing tanspa products at least they could talk shop after work his dream of working as a photographer was starting to pan out too hed done three weddings in the past two weeks alone adam had asked star to marry him and shed asked him for time to think about it it had been almost a month since hed asked and what had not been said changed the tone of everything that had she called her mom to ask for her advice but the answer had been typical lucille you know my husband do you really want my advice about marriage her parents stormy relationship had endured some rough weather her dads onagain offagain wrestling with the bottle her moms sharp wit and steady criticism their fights terrified star once she even hid her brother hank in a rain barrel at a neighbors shed and reported him missing in a misguided effort to scare her parents and extort promises of good behavior but arcady key was a tiny island community and the incident was more a source of laughter than anything else no promises from stars parents were made or kept but amidst it all there was still a lot of love and laughter the fights continued but so did the nights when star fell asleep to the steady squeaking of her parents bedsprings its our way star lucille had often said shrugging in explanation maybe it was time to get married and make a new beginning of it maybe this was what she was looking for maybe adam and the firebird and miami beach were what was behind the pickled beets and the ketchup after all the advice she missed the most was that of her grandfather her moms dad papa jens had always been a special ally for star when she was growing up his mercurial intelligence and metaphysical sensibilities had been unexpectedly grounding for a young girl rooted in such sandy soil life is but a dream he would sing to her when the world was too much with her the tears came more than ten years later as she remembered losing him that night he slipped away in his sleep star always thought hed found a dream he particularly liked and just stayed the light at arena turned red and star turned the rearview to check that the tear for papa jens hadnt played too much havoc with her liner a quick blot and a smear of fresh lipstick and a groan over her current suninaccident hair color and she was ready for work as she caught her own gaze in the tiny reflection she could hear the old mans voice as if he were right there beside her star papa jens soothed what are you fretting about girl life is but a dream remember papa she whispered alone in the car you are a brandnew light my girl she remembered his south florida accent you are not an extension of your parents or that little town you are an original you were born a star and you always will be all life asks of you is that you let your light shine dont hurt yourself or anyone else and embrace all that life has to offer you the rest will unfold dont you worry the horn brought her back to the front seat of the impala and calle ocho she gave a little wave of apology to the car behind her and drove on the memory made her smile but it also made her wish she could ask the old mans advice one last time determined to snap out of it she switched on the radio as the lead singer of journey sang out just a small town girl livin in a lonely world she cranked up the soupedup radio shed invested in and sang along as loud as she could dont stop believin by the time she arrived at mothers she was ten minutes late and feeling refreshed and reassured there you are theresa hissed spotting star through the lockerroom door hey ter star grinned as she strapped on the small canvas apron containing her guest checks and bank for the evening sorry im late madam sin sin was ready to retake north vietnam today honestly if she doesnt find a boyfriend soon im going to break into my savings and hire her the biggest mothers looking for you theresa said cutting her off and you just missed adam whats he so pissed about i dont know star shrugged it was only a halftruth she didnt really know what it was this time he seemed okay yesterday star sat heavily on the bench beside the lockers where the staff stowed their purses and street clothes just off the kitchen the dingy room reeked of old sneakers foot powder and fried seafood the only ornamentation in the windowless cell was the choking poster that detailed the heimlich maneuver and a handlettered sign exhorting employees to wash their hands on the far end was a sink a medicine cabinet and the door to the toilet a bench was bolted to the floor down the center of the room and on one side of that was a bank of old graygreen lockers that mother had bought as surplus after a hurricane had leveled a local junior high they had survived the storm but only just opposite the rough wooden shelf bolted to the wall served as vanity table to the lighted makeup mirror affixed to the wall above depending on which way you faced from your seat on the bench you were either in the dressing room or the makeup room but really you were just in a glorified broom closet well adam was plenty pissed and slamming around let me tell you theresa said sitting on the bench beside star and facing the makeuproom side as she checked herself in the mirror came back in the kitchen screaming out your name mother picked him up by the shirtfront and set him beside the dumpster out back said next time hed be in the dumpster if he came in the place acting like trash mother was bernie weintraub a great grizzly bear of a man who defended and guided his girls with similar bruin ferocity now hes looking for me star said biting the side of her lower lip you bet your tights theresa sighed star yeah do you think hes worth it mother no adam ladies vanda the senior girl said popping her head into the locker room just a reminder we keep the customers in the dining room so theres no point waiting for them back here sorry vanda coming star said glad of the interruption she tested the bow on her apron as she made her way to the kitchen well theresa asked pursuing her is he oh for heavens sake theresa star giggled thats like saying quick whats the meaning of life you only find out after its over that seems like a mean trick theresa said arms folded star andre the head cook and shucker hollered as they passed through on their way to the dining room dinnertime he called tossing her an enormous chocolate chip cookie frisbeestyle thanks andre star said catching it between two hands and backing through the swinging door into the dining room the cookies were a shared joke stars vegetarian diet was at odds with the steakhouse menu at mother pearls star the bartender called to the busy room as she took up her corktopped tray the crowd took up the greeting star they called not together but in fits and starts as they spotted her like a syncopated echo erratic and startling but totally endearing star there you are called a familiar voice randy andy star said dropping off a couple of beers before making her way over to their table hi boys are those clamshells in your pockets or just the best you can do you know better than that randy grinned youve been in our hot tub before randy and andy were the worlds oldest living frat boys theyd made a career out of being goodlooking beach bums always hustling some angle to keep themselves afloat without actually having to work their most successful scheme was getting the zax beer company to pay for their jeep gas insurance and all by designating it the zax mobile and turning it into a rolling billboard for the company their backyard jacuzzi was also the scene of frequent zax promotions which kept the hot tub bubbling and the coolers full of complimentary beer so whatll it be star teased a couple of buds never andy said clutching his throat dramatically maybe some iced tea both guys slumped over tongues lolling out of their mouths like a couple of dead bodies how about the refreshing smooth taste of zax star said mocking the commercial the only brew that could tame old rough and ready zax you say randy said stroking his chin that sounds interesting yes lets try some of that andy suggested all right then star laughed so star you got plans tomorrow night i have plans every night star winked it just depends on what kind of mood im in as to which ones i end up keeping how about spending the evening with the miami dolphins oh i dont know star began we really need you randy put in its a zax thing and we need more bodacious babes like yourself so you two wont look like losers star teased crossing her arms exactly andy agreed we want to show people that if they drink zax they can come to the dolphins games with you but youre not going to promise them that right star asked to make sure with randy and andy it was never wise to leave such things to chance well if you put it like thatno randy said with a little pout i dont know guys she said with a toss of her hair i havent been spending enough time with adam lately oh come on star andy urged you have to embrace what life has to offer you the phrase shed heard so often from her grandfather stopped her in her tracks and stunned her into silence here was a small but very real opportunity to say yes to life so well pick you up tomorrow evening andy asked tentatively when she said nothing else no tricks zax honor both guys said raising their bottles and two more she asked writing down their order always randy said as luck would have it im off tomorrow night and im pretty sure i saw two more cold zax in the fridge so you guys get both your wishes she said turning to go pick you up at six andy called after her time passed with no sign of mother or adam star was having a pretty good night of it along with the miami tourists there for the tshirts and what was in them one of the regulars had a birthday party that meant the traditional mother pearls gob smack a polaroid of a kiss on the cheek from one of pearls girls and of course a souvenir tshirt the birthday boy was required to wear in the photo star was just presenting the birthday party with the polaroid in its cardboard oystershell frame when theresa brushed by and whispered in her ear you might want to take your break now theresa said with a note of warning in her voice stars head snapped to the front door in search of adam and to the office door in search of mother spotting neither she caught up to theresa already on her way to the back whats up ter the leech theresa said moving on theresa star sighed following her you have got to stop calling brandi that okay theresa said raising her shoulder mockingly the mooch then is that better theresa star warned okay lookit theresa began when was the last time you heard from brandi there i said her name are you satisfied when was the last time you heard from her that she didnt want something i dont know i dont keep track star said as the two turned in their drink orders at the service bar yeah well how about never shes always borrowing your clothes your time even your boyfriend alvin was not my boyfriend star cut her off he had a crush on me but i was not interested im glad they got together but she only wanted him cause he was with you theresa said exasperated why do you refuse to see it shes a loser and a leech she is a figure skater and she has all her badges star defended that cant be a bad thing yeah right tonya harding turned out okay theresa laughed and remember her modeling portfolio borrowing your clothes and wearing them to get her pictures made in the photo booth in front of kmart and then passing them out to people at school and sending them to magazines and modeling agencies that was a little odd star agreed reluctantly everything about her is a little odd theresa said starting to get herself wound up theresa was protective of star she loved her best friend dearly but worried about her tendency to trust people too readily those underwear shots her stepdad took of her and sent into the star search spokesmodel competition they were lingerie shots star corrected without much conviction as she loaded up her tray with beers and drinks no lingerie shots are sexy and provocative and tasteful and most of all professionally done theresa insisted these were just sleazy snapshots of her lying on her sears french provincial canopy bed in her bra and panties i always liked that bed star it was the best they could do you are always trying to find the best in people theresa snapped irritably and thats a bad thing no theresa sulked its one of the things i like best about you star there you are brandi called approaching hey brandi star said with a little hug howve you been i havent seen you since the miss dade mall contest too bad about your baton catching that hairpiece on fire well at least i met that cute fireman brandi said with a snort of laughter did alvin get to meet him too theresa asked primly star gave theresas shoe a little kick oh hi maria brandi said with a little smirk of a smile im sure one day if you ever get a boyfriend youll understand its theresa and maybe ill just ask alvin to explain it to me shotzy theresa said dodging the second kick from star excuse me ladies what was that all about brandi asked rolling her eyes oh before i forget new shots she reached into her backpack and pulled out a strip of photobooth pictures she tore off a couple and handed them to star these are nice star said squinting isnt that my vest im so glad you think so brandi said hopping nervously and exuberantly from one foot to the other ive got a test shoot tomorrow for mann magazine shut up star gasped that is so cool yeah brandi said continuing her dance i sent in some of those shots my stepfather took the test is tomorrow both girls squealed with excitement that is so great star said joining in the little dance im really nervous though and i was wonderingcould you help me out sure star said trying to wipe theresas words from her mind if i can would you come and do my hair and makeup brandi asked suddenly still taking both of stars hands in hers youre the only almostcosmetologist i know and you do such a great job with your own i really admire your taste please of course i will star said trying not to let on that shed just given away pretty much her entire day off ive got to go the dolphins game with randy and andy at six though no problem brandi said embracing star this is so great i dont know how to thank you you gonna drink all those yourself vanda asked as she breezed by pointing at stars full tray sitting on the bar beside them i gotta work star said with an apologetic shrug as she turned and hefted the overloaded tray onto her arm im sorry of course brandi said climbing onto a nearby stool ill just wait at the bar and we can talk about it all on your next break thanks i star began but that was as far as she got the tray full of drinks was knocked violently out of her hand the room was filled with the sound of breaking glass and then a shocked silence there you are adam shouted why the hell havent you called me back you didnt call me adam star said irritably look at this mess i left a message on your machine well when i get home at two oclock in the morning ill be sure and call you back star snapped leaning down to pick up her tray off the floor meanwhile i havent been home since seven this morning so theres no way i could have heard your message let alone called you back always a smart answer adam said knocking the tray from her hands again and why couldnt you call last night tell me that was it because you were at a party halfnaked he demanded grabbing the front of stars tshirt and ripping it straight down the front there now you can run around naked at work too as he reached for the waistband of the onionskin running shorts adams feet left the ground the silence more than the sound of breaking glass had alerted mothers trained ear and he had emerged from his office mama bear on the charge adams legs wiggled helplessly in the air as mother bore him toward the glass doors that opened onto the restaurants crowded bayside deck andy held the door for them as the ambivalent weeknight crowd looked on in horror and satisfaction the patrons on the deck unaware of the disturbance inside had almost no time to react as mother emerged from the main dining room under full steam made his way to the railing and threw adam overhand into biscayne bay there mother called down as adam splashed and spluttered in the water below that should cool you off a bit stop by later and you can settle up with me for that tray of drinks the crowd stood and cheered quick theresa said grabbing star youve got to get out of here mother is going to kill you oh he is not star said clutching her gaping tshirt hell just yell and tell me adam can never come in here again and then at the next big party all will be forgiven marias right brandi said you should get out of here now even if youre not worried about mother adam isnt going to be too happy with you when he does get out of the water i do have to get dressed star said as they hustled her into the back and toward the rear exit although i kind of think this is a cute look arcady key was a little spit of land in the gulf of mexico just west of key largo between buttonwood sound and spoil banks brandi and star had both grown up there along with theresa and adam despite its more famous and prestigious neighbors like nearby key largo or far to the south key west life in arcady key was more like the smalltown life of southern and central florida than anything else the towns only nod to being island dwellers was the annual bathtub race across buttonwood sound to pelican key stars father along with the other drunks and wouldbe engineers on arcady and the surrounding keys added motors and sails and all manner of shadetree mechanical inventions to oldfashioned footed bathtubs in an attempt to navigate them across the half mile of sheltered gulf waters to pelican key it was about the only seagoing that any of the locals ever did otherwise they might just as well have lived in homestead or florida city a few miles north on the mainland stars parents lucille and rick had lived there all their lives but for star the tiny island lacked room to run and fuel for her imagination at fourteen possessed by her dreams of independence and life in the big city she had actually run away in search of something she couldnt define but knew she couldnt find on the key her mother had known full well where star was and arranged for her to stay with her sister june in coral gables for several weeks star pretended to be a young career woman dressing in her aunts suits and taking the bus downtown to brickell avenue to wander among the glistering towers as they refracted that southflorida sun and showered her with rainbows in truth she mostly hung out at the museum complex on flagler also a perfect setting for dreams they had all indulged the fantasy as long as it was practical but eventually stars dad showed up with the family pickup and piled her and her belongings into the truck back home to reality and arcady key it had been a struggle but lucille was a wise woman and in exchange for stars return she had offered her daughter the one thing she knew she couldnt resist a dog his name was mutley and he had been chosen only after star had picked up and hugged every single solitary puppy in the dade county pound its his eyes star had said cryptically when pressed to explain what seemed to others so humble a choice after such an exhaustive search he seems very wise like he has an old soul and i like his smile star was forever rescuing strays curing abandoned baby birds and brokenwinged gulls and bottlefeeding lost baby raccoons it got to the point where her mother had strictly forbidden the presence of any bird mammal fish or varmint in or near the leigh household so mutleys arrival had been much heralded this inscrutable interloper was the center of stars life keeping her at home until she was nearly nineteen years old but at last even mutley was unable to hold stars desire for more dreaming room and she moved the fortysomething miles up the overseas highway to miami and the world outside still mutleys siren call drew her home frequently her mom always joked that if anything ever happened to mutley they might never see star again it wasnt true but it wasnt far from wrong life was different for brandi she lived with her stepfather oz the neighborhood pot dealer her mom had fallen in love with long distance leaving brandi and her stepfather on their own when brandi was twelve there had always been plenty of drinking in and around stars home but that was as far as it went she had never even tried pot and with her passion for athletics had no interest shed always taken the reputation with a shrug she didnt smoke but it didnt bother her so whats the difference it was the kind of liveandletlive attitude most of the locals shared even so star had never liked being around the fescue household they seemed nice enough brandi and her stepdad and he was a good guy driving brandi all the way to miami sometimes four and five times a week for iceskating lessons brandis interests had shifted to modeling when she turned fifteen and oz had taken up photography to accommodate her they made rolls of what they had called lingerie shots but star had to admit that theresa was right on this one they were just pictures of brandi in her underwear when oz had offered to take some similar shots of star she had politely declined and stopped visiting though brandi was frequently at the leigh house so it was with much trepidation that star made her way over to the fescue house that night as the girls scrambled in the kitchen to get star into a chefs smock out the door and into brandis purple gremlin they had decided that the best way to avoid adam was for star to hide out with brandi at the place she still shared with her stepfather on the key so they left stars car at the restaurant to decoy adam and give themselves a considerable head start hi mr fescue star said wiggling her fingers in a pale wave as the creaky screened door snapped shut behind her causing her to jump well if it isnt little esther leigh oz said rising oz its star brandi corrected everyone calls esther star you two entertain each other ill be right back she instructed giving her stepfather a kiss and heading back in the direction of her room well it has been a while oz said as he bore down on star with open arms if brandi hadnt told me you were coming im not sure id have recognized you i like that hair color and youve filled out right nicely oz said with a hungry look that made star shiver thanks mr fescue she said frozen just a few feet inside the front door oh honey call me oz he said giving her as much of a hug as shed let him and gesturing to a chair near the tv everyone does okay oz star said with a nervous laugh as she edged in toward the chair thanks the decor was what stars mom would call a trailer without the wheels all prefab and machinematched lifeless cold and made entirely out of petroleum products it was the sort of room that could only accurately be described with terms like woodtone and leatherette the chair made farting sounds as star sat down no problem oz said flopping down on the chair beside hers oblivious to the embarrassing noises you want a beer yes that would be nice star agreed still shaken from the events of the evening and not feeling the least bit calmed by the change of scenery well here you go oz said opening the lid on the cooler beside his chair and pulling out a couple of bottles of zax thanks star said a little startled by the gesture and the cooler the leigh house may not have been the center of sophistication but unless it was super bowl sunday or the daytona 500 coolers full of beer were not kept in the living room well certainly oz said patting her knee with a cold clammy hand straight from the cooler brandi you want a beer no thanks but roll us a fat one for the road would you she shouted back from wherever she was you got it little missy oz took out an old metal zax beer tray already strewn with a packet of papers and a lid of dope you all will have to forgive me for a little while oz said apologetically as he began to clean a joints worth of dope on the metal tray tapping it gently with his index finger to separate the stems and seeds from the buds the seeds rolled free down the smooth metal tray as he tapped and then scooped the partially cleaned dope moving it up the slant of the tray he had balanced in his lap before tapping again ive got a couple of associates coming by and they prefer to keep their business confidential so if you two can give me a couple of hours here on my own why that would be great then we can have ourselves a high old time when you get back well brandi has her shoot tomorrow so wed probably better make an early night of it star suggested brandi early oz guffawed thatll be the day its good of you to help her out with the shoot tomorrow im glad to do it star said moving her knee in time to avoid a grateful pat from ozs big paw okay brandi said returning with a couple of bags of chips a small playmate cooler and a mans dress shirt which she tossed to star here this will be better than that galleyslave uniform put this on and lets get out of here before ozs creepy friends get here hows that jay coming just a little spit and its ready muffin oz said licking the paper with his pointy lizard tongue where can i change star asked brandi oh right heres fine brandi shrugged i do it all the time nothing he hasnt seen well i can think of a couple of things he hasnt star giggled using her mother pearls tableside manner to manage a moment that made her blush she stepped just out of view into the hallway and slipped on the oversize shirt as she tossed the smock back through the doorway gypsy rose lee style star tried not to die as she tied the excess of what was clearly one of ozs oxfordcloth shirts at her waist and reemerged with a flourish looks better on you than it ever did on me oz said his tongue still flicking lazily at the joint brandi drove out to sunset point and parked the car this is my favorite spot to watch the sun set brandi explained leading the way we can burn this and kill some time until the coast is clear back at casa m205a they spread out their picnic on a recently felled palmetto log so youve never smoked pot before brandi asked incredulously whats the weather like on your planet ive never even smoked a cigarette star shrugged remember i was a jock in high school so none of that youre doing okay with that beer brandi snorted okay so watch me you breathe in a little smoke through your mouthcareful not too much you hold it for a minute and then blow it out like this brandi demonstrated a couple of hits and then passed the joint to star star accepted the joint and the challenge taking a big manly puff she dissolved into a huge coughing fit brandi laughed losing her toke nice job brandi said recovering try just a little ladylike toke this time i dont know star said a little lightheaded aw come on brandi urged taking another for herself and then insistently pushing the joint stars way star made another attempt this one more successful and coughingfitfree the two sat silently on the log to watch the sun sink into the glowing orange waters of the gulf it didnt take too long for the joint to do its work and it soon went out from neglect as both were too stoned to remember they were smoking it brandi laughed and tucked it into the cellophane of her salem lights cigarette pack whats so funny star asked finding herself unable to resist the urge to laugh anyway im hungry she giggled though she couldnt have told you why brandi laughed again and tore open a bag of chips here she said offering you wont believe how good these are ive had these before star shrugged theyre all right she took one the taste exploded on her tongue the texture the salt the almost burnt quality of the dark brown kettle chip ran riot across her taste buds suddenly she was starving these are amazing she raved taking a handful as brandi laughed at her yet again yeah brandi nodded a lot of stuff is amazing after you smoke a jay here lean back ill rub your shoulders youll see a seagull startled them with its hoarse strangled cry as it settled onto the sand nearby eyeing them hey fella star called you want a chip dont you she tossed him one from her stash lean back brandi said placing a hand on stars shoulder and guiding her back to rest against her warm firm hands brandi slowly began to work through the knots of tension left over from stars day the beers the joint and the massage combined and soon star was so relaxed that she was limp moaning and giggling brandi slid her hands under the loosefitting shirt and unhooked stars bra thats better star groaned as she let the bra fall to the ground brandi continued the massage as star slumped down onto the log every now and then shed take another chip for herself and toss one to her buddy the gull oh this is so perfect star said bathed in the orange glow of the sunset and the warm haze of brandis attentions as the sun languidly slipped toward the water brandis skilled hands worked their way down stars back and slowly she turned to jello brandi worked the heels of her hands into the small of stars back and star started to drift off lying forward on the log they were straddling suddenly stars eyes sprang open a finger slipped under the leg of the loosefitting shorts she was still wearing from work it wasnt unpleasant but it was unexpected maybe it was just an accident star thought as brandis hands worked down her thigh again she nodded and again her eyes flew open with a start as that errant finger slipped more insistently through the loosefitting leg of her uniform clearly this wasnt an accident brbrandi star began but her objections were overruled when all at once the finger found its purchase with a practice no man could have star gasped again but this time not from shock probably not a good idea but so so good she thought the finger became more insistent and star shudderedshe never imagined being so close to brandi to any girl her breath got shorter and her body tingled and shuddered she arched her back raising her head and bringing it back down to rest facing toward the sea the beautiful waters lapping insistently at the shore lost in the moment stars lids fluttered open when she suddenly realized that they were surrounded by hundreds of seagulls all just standing and staring at them brandi star said urgently shhh brandi soothed working a second finger under the panty line and gently raking the tender flesh with her fingertips just brushing its okay dont tense up now but brandi i think you should know its okay its perfectly natural brandi urged silencing her with tiny hungry kisses star fought and then succumbed soft lips on soft lips it doesnt mean a thing brandi look around us star hissed reawakening from the pleasure were in a fucking alfred hitchcock movie brandi looked up and gasped one of the gulls let out a harsh cry and brandi screamed that was it suddenly the whole flock exploded into flight surrounding both screaming women with the beating wings of hundreds of startled and frightened gulls star abandoned her bra the chips and even brandi as she wrapped the shirt around her face and ran by the time the two were back to the car they were laughing so hard they could hardly breathe they sat on the warm hood of the gremlin and leaned against the windshield as they watched the last of the sunset and caught their breath well star said cutting the uncomfortable moment short and dusting herself primly ive never had sand there before the two girls lay back on the hood and laughed the laugh of the stoned thank god nobody else was around for that star chuckled itll be our secret brandi said with a cheshire grin
