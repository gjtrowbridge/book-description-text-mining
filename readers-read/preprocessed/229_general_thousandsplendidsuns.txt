 it happened on a thursday it must have because mariam remembered that she had been restless and preoccupied that day the way she was only on thursdays the day when jalil visited her at the kolba to pass the time until the moment that she would see him at last crossing the kneehigh grass in the clearing and waving mariam had climbed a chair and taken down her mothers chinese tea set the tea set was the sole relic that mariams mother nana had of her own mother who had died when nana was two nana cherished each blueandwhite porcelain piece the graceful curve of the pots spout the handpainted finches and chrysanthemums the dragon on the sugar bowl meant to ward off evil it was this last piece that slipped from mariams fingers that fell to the wooden floorboards of the kolba and shattered when nana saw the bowl her face flushed red and her upper lip shivered and her eyes both the lazy one and the good settled on mariam in a flat unblinking way nana looked so mad that mariam feared the jinn would enter her mothers body again but the jinn didnt come not that time instead nana grabbed mariam by the wrists pulled her close and through gritted teeth said you are a clumsy little harami this is my reward for everything ive endured an heirloombreaking clumsy little harami at the time mariam did not understand she did not know what this word haramibastardmeant nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice to see that it is the creators of the harami who are culpable not the harami whose only sin is being born mariam did surmise by the way nana said the word that it was an ugly loathsome thing to be a harami like an insect like the scurrying cockroaches nana was always cursing and sweeping out of the kolba later when she was older mariam did understand it was the way nana uttered the wordnot so much saying it as spitting it at herthat made mariam feel the full sting of it she understood then what nana meant that a harami was an unwanted thing that she mariam was an illegitimate person who would never have legitimate claim to the things other people had things such as love family home acceptance jalil never called mariam this name jalil said she was his little flower he was fond of sitting her on his lap and telling her stories like the time he told her that herat the city where mariam was born in 1959 had once been the cradle of persian culture the home of writers painters and sufis you couldnt stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass he laughed jalil told her the story of queen gauhar shad who had raised the famous minarets as her loving ode to herat back in the fifteenth century he described to her the green wheat fields of herat the orchards the vines pregnant with plump grapes the citys crowded vaulted bazaars there is a pistachio tree jalil said one day and beneath it mariam jo is buried none other than the great poet jami he leaned in and whispered jami lived over five hundred years ago he did i took you there once to the tree you were little you wouldnt remember it was true mariam didnt remember and though she would live the first fifteen years of her life within walking distance of herat mariam would never see this storied tree she would never see the famous minarets up close and she would never pick fruit from herats orchards or stroll in its fields of wheat but whenever jalil talked like this mariam would listen with enchantment she would admire jalil for his vast and worldly knowledge she would quiver with pride to have a father who knew such things what rich lies nana said after jalil left rich man telling rich lies he never took you to any tree and dont let him charm you he betrayed us your beloved father he cast us out he cast us out of his big fancy house like we were nothing to him he did it happily mariam would listen dutifully to this she never dared say to nana how much she disliked her talking this way about jalil the truth was that around jalil mariam did not feel at all like a harami for an hour or two every thursday when jalil came to see her all smiles and gifts and endearments mariam felt deserving of all the beauty and bounty that life had to give and for this mariam loved jalil even if she had to share him jalil had three wives and nine children nine legitimate children all of whom were strangers to mariam he was one of herats wealthiest men he owned a cinema which mariam had never seen but at her insistence jalil had described it to her and so she knew that the faade was made of blueandtan terracotta tiles that it had private balcony seats and a trellised ceiling double swinging doors opened into a tiled lobby where posters of hindi films were encased in glass displays on tuesdays jalil said one day kids got free ice cream at the concession stand nana smiled demurely when he said this she waited until he had left the kolba before snickering and saying the children of strangers get ice cream what do you get mariam stories of ice cream in addition to the cinema jalil owned land in karokh land in farah three carpet stores a clothing shop and a black 1956 buick roadmaster he was one of herats bestconnected men friend of the mayor and the provincial governor he had a cook a driver and three housekeepers nana had been one of the housekeepers until her belly began to swell when that happened nana said the collective gasp of jalils family sucked the air out of herat his inlaws swore blood would flow the wives demanded that he throw her out nanas own father who was a lowly stone carver in the nearby village of gul daman disowned her disgraced he packed his things and boarded a bus to iran never to be seen or heard from again sometimes nana said early one morning as she was feeding the chickens outside the kolba i wish my father had had the stomach to sharpen one of his knives and do the honorable thing it might have been better for me she tossed another handful of seeds into the coop paused and looked at mariam better for you too maybe it would have spared you the grief of knowing that you are what you are but he was a coward my father he didnt have the dil the heart for it jalil didnt have the dil either nana said to do the honorable thing to stand up to his family to his wives and inlaws and accept responsibility for what he had done instead behind closed doors a facesaving deal had quickly been struck the next day he had made her gather her few things from the servants quarters where shed been living and sent her off you know what he told his wives by way of defense that i forced myself on him that it was my fault didi you see this is what it means to be a woman in this world nana put down the bowl of chicken feed she lifted mariams chin with a finger look at me mariam reluctantly mariam did nana said learn this now and learn it well my daughter like a compass needle that points north a mans accusing finger always finds a woman always you remember that mariam
