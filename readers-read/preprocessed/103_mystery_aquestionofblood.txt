 theres no mystery detective sergeant siobhan clarke said herdman lost his marbles thats all she was sitting by a hospital bed in edinburghs recently opened royal infirmary the complex was to the south of the city in an area called little france it had been built at considerable expense on open space but already there were complaints about a lack of useable space inside and carparking space outside siobhan had found a spot eventually only to discover that she would be charged for the privilege this much she had told detective inspector john rebus on her arrival at his bedside rebuss hands were bandaged to the wrists when shed poured him some tepid water hed cupped the plastic glass to his mouth drinking carefully as she watched see hed chided her afterwards didnt spill a drop but then hed spoiled the act by letting the cup slip as he tried to maneuver it back on to the bedside table the rim of its base hit the floor siobhan snatching it on the first bounce good catch rebus had conceded no harm done it was empty anyway since then shed been making what both of them knew was small talk skirting questions she was desperate to ask and instead filling him in on the slaughter in south queensferry three dead one wounded a quiet coastal town just north of the city a private school taking boys and girls from ages five to eighteen enrollment of six hundred now minus two the third body belonged to the gunman whod turned his weapon on himself no mystery as siobhan had said except for the why he was like you she was saying exarmy i mean they reckon thats why he did it grudge against society rebus noticed that her hands were now being kept firmly in the pockets of her jacket he guessed they were clenched and that she didnt know she was doing it the papers say he ran a business he said he had a powerboat used to take out waterskiers but he had a grudge she shrugged rebus knew she was wishing there was a place for her at the scene anything to take her mind off the other inquiry internal this time and with her at its core she was staring at the wall above his head as if there were something there she was interested in other than the paintwork and an oxygen outlet you havent asked me how im feeling he said she looked at him how are you feeling im going stircrazy thank you for asking youve only been in one night feels like more what do the doctors say nobodys been to see me yet not today whatever they tell me im out of here this afternoon and then what how do you mean you cant go back to work finally she studied his hands howre you going to drive or type a report what about taking phone calls ill manage he looked around him his turn now to avoid eye contact surrounded by men much his age and sporting the same grayish pallor the scots diet had taken its toll on this lot no doubt about it one guy was coughing for want of a cigarette another looked like he had breathing problems the overweight swollenlivered mass of local manhood rebus held up one hand so he could rub a forearm over his left cheek feeling the unshaven rasp the bristles he knew would be the same silvered color as the walls of his ward ill manage he repeated into the silence lowering the arm again and wishing he hadnt raised it in the first place his fingers sparked with pain as the blood pounded through them have they spoken to you he asked about what come on siobhan she looked at him unblinking her hands emerged from their hiding place as she leaned forwards on the chair ive another session this afternoon who with the boss meaning detective chief superintendent gill templer rebus nodded satisfied that as yet it wasnt going any higher what will you say to her he asked theres nothing to tell i didnt have anything to do with fairstones death she paused another unasked question hanging between them did you she seemed to be waiting for rebus to say something but he stayed silent shell want to know about you siobhan added how you ended up in here i scalded myself rebus said its stupid but thats what happened i know thats what you say happened no siobhan its what happened ask the doctors if you dont believe me he looked around again always supposing you can find one probably still combing the grounds for a parking space the joke was weak enough but rebus smiled anyway she was letting him know she wouldnt be pressing him any further his smile was one of gratitude whos in charge at south queensferry he asked her signaling a change of subject i think di hogans out there bobbys a good guy if it can be wrapped up fast hell do it media circus by all accounts grant hoods been drafted in to handle liaison leaving us shortchanged at st leonards rebus was thoughtful all the more reason for me to get back there especially if im suspended you wont be you said it yourself siobhanyou didnt have anything to do with fairstone way i see it it was an accident now that something biggers come along maybe itll die a natural death so to speak an accident she was repeating his words he nodded slowly so dont worry about it unless of course you really did top the bastard john there was a warning in her tone rebus smiled again and managed a wink only joking he said i know damned fine who gills going to want to see in the frame for fairstone he died in a fire john and that means i killed him rebus held up both hands turning them this way and that scalds siobhan thats all just scalds she rose from the chair if you say so john then she stood in front of him while he lowered his hands biting back the sudden rush of agony a nurse was approaching saying something about changing his dressings im just going siobhan informed her then to rebus id hate to think youd do something so stupid and imagine it was on my behalf he started shaking his head slowly and she turned and walked away keep the faith siobhan he called after her that your daughter the nurse asked making conversation just a friend someone i work with you something to do with the church rebus winced as she started unpeeling one of his bandages what makes you say that the way you were talking about faith job like mine you need more than most he paused but then maybe its the same for you me she smiled her eyes on her handiwork she was short and plainlooking and businesslike cant hang around waiting for faith to do anything for you so how did you manage this she meant his blistered hands i got into hot water he explained feeling a bead of sweat beginning its slow journey down one temple pain i can handle he thought to himself the problem was everything else can we switch to something lighter than bandages you keen to be on your way keen to pick up a cup without dropping it or a phone he thought besides theres got to be someone out there needs the bed more than i do very publicminded im sure well have to see what the doctor says and which doctor would that be just have a bit of patience eh patience the one thing he had no time for maybe youll have some more visitors the nurse added he doubted it no one knew he was here except siobhan hed got one of the staff to call her so she could tell templer that he was taking a sick day maybe two at the most thing was the call had brought siobhan running maybe hed known it would maybe thats why hed phoned her rather than the station that had been yesterday afternoon yesterday morning hed given up the fight and walked into his gps office the doctor filling in had taken one look and told him to get himself to a hospital rebus had taken a taxi to ae embarrassed when the driver had to dig the money for the fare out of his trouser pockets did you hear the news the cabbie had asked a shooting at a school probably an air gun but the man had shaken his head worse than that according to the radio at ae rebus had waited his turn eventually his hands had been dressed the injuries not serious enough to merit a trip to the burns unit out at livingston but he was running a high temperature so theyd decided to keep him in an ambulance transferring him from ae to little france he thought they were probably keeping an eye on him in case he went into shock or something or it could be they feared he was one of those selfharm people nobodyd come to talk to him about that maybe thats why they were hanging on to him waiting for a psychiatrist with a free moment he wondered about jean burchill the one person who might notice his sudden disappearance from home but things had cooled there a little they managed a night together maybe once every ten days spoke on the phone more frequently met for coffee some afternoons already it felt like a routine he recalled that a while ago hed dated a nurse for a short time he didnt know if she still worked locally he could always ask but her name was escaping him it was a problem he had trouble sometimes with names forgot the odd appointment not a big deal really just part and parcel of the aging process but in court he found himself referring to his notes more and more when giving evidence ten years ago he hadnt needed a script or any prompts hed acted with more confidence and that always impressed juries so lawyers had told him there now his nurse was straightening up shed put fresh grease and gauze on his hands wrapped the old bandages back around them feel more comfortable he nodded the skin felt a little cooler but he knew it wouldnt last you due any more painkillers the question was rhetorical she checked the chart at the bottom of his bed earlier after a visit to the toilet hed looked at it himself it gave his temperature and medication nothing else no coded information meant to be understood only by those in the know no record of the story hed given when he was being examined id run a hot bathslipped and fell in the doctor had made a kind of noise at the back of his throat something that said he would accept this without necessarily believing it overworked lacking sleep not his job to pry doctor rather than detective i can give you some paracetamol the nurse suggested any chance of a beer to wash them down she smiled that professional smile again the years shed worked in the nhs she probably didnt hear too many original lines ill see what i can do youre an angel rebus said surprising himself it was the sort of thing he felt a patient might say one of those comfortable clich233s she was on her way and he wasnt sure shed heard maybe it was something in the nature of hospitals even if you didnt feel ill they still had an effect slowing you down making you compliant institutionalizing you it could be to do with the color scheme the background hum maybe the heating of the place was complicit too back at st leonards they had a special cell for the maddies it was bright pink and was supposed to calm them down why think a similar psychology wasnt being employed here last thing they wanted was a stroppy patient shouting the odds and jumping out of bed every five minutes hence the suffocating number of blankets tightly tucked in to further hamper movement just lie stillpropped by pillows bask in the heat and lightdont make a fuss any more of this he felt and hed start forgetting his own name the world outside would cease to matter no job waiting for him no fairstone no maniac spraying gunfire through the classrooms rebus turned on his side using his legs to push free the sheets it was a twoway fight like harry houdini in a straitjacket the man in the next bed over had opened his eyes and was watching rebus winked at him as he levered his feet into fresh air just you keep tunneling he told the man ill go for a walk trickle the earth out of my trouser leg the reference seemed lost on his fellow prisoner siobhan was back at st leonards loitering by the drink machine a couple of uniforms were seated at a table in the small cafeteria munching on sandwiches and crisps the drink machine was in the adjoining hallway with a view out to the car park if she were a smoker she would have an excuse to step outside where there was less chance of gill templer finding her but she didnt smoke she knew she could try ducking into the underventilated gym farther along the corridor or she could take a walk to the cells but there was nothing to stop templer using the stations pa system to hunt down her quarry word would get around anyway that she was on the premises st leonards was like that no hiding place she yanked on the cola cans ring pull knowing what the uniforms at the table would be discussing same thing as everyone else three dead in school shootout shed scanned each of the mornings papers there were grainy photos of both the teenage victims boys seventeen years old the words tragedy waste shock and carnage had been bandied about by the journalists alongside the news story additional reporting filled page after page britains burgeoning gun cultureschool security shortfallsa history of suicide killers shed studied the photos of the assassinapparently only three different snaps had so far been available to the media one was very blurry indeed as if capturing a ghost rather than something made of flesh and blood another showed a man in overalls taking hold of a rope as he made to board a small boat he was smiling head turned towards the camera siobhan got the feeling it was a publicity shot for his waterskiing business the third was a headandshoulders portrait from the mans days in military service herdman his name was lee herdman age thirtysix resident in south queensferry owner of a speedboat there were photos of the yard where his business operated from a scant halfmile from the site of the shocking event as one paper gushed exforces probably easy enough for him to get a gun drove into the school grounds parked next to all the staff cars left his driversside door open obviously in a hurry witnesses saw him barge into the school his first and only stop the common room three people inside two now dead one wounded then a shot to his own temple and that was that criticisms were already flying how was it possible postdunblane for christs sake for someone just to walk into a school had herdman shown any signs that he might be about to crack could doctors or social workers be blamed the government somebody anybody it had to be someones fault no point just blaming herdman he was dead there had to be a scapegoat out there siobhan suspected that by tomorrow theyd be wheeling out the usual suspects violence in modern culturefilms and tvpressures of life then it would quiet down again one statistic she had taken notice of since the laws on gun ownership had been tightened after the dunblane massacre gun offenses in the uk had actually risen she knew what the gun lobby would make of that one reason everyone at st leonards was talking about the murders was that the survivors father was a member of the scottish parliament and not just any msp jack bell had found himself in trouble six months back apprehended by police during a trawl of the redlight district down in leith residents had been holding demonstrations petitioning the constabulary to take action against the problem the constabulary had reacted by swooping down one night netting jack bell msp amongst others but bell had protested his innocence putting his appearance in the area down to factfinding his wife had backed him up as had most of his party with the result that police hq had decided to let the matter drop but not before the media had had their fun at bells expense leading the msp to accuse the police of being in cahoots with the gutter press of hounding him because of who he was the resentment had festered leading bell to make several speeches in parliament usually remarking on inefficiency within the force and the need for change all of which it was agreed might lead to a problem because bell had been arrested by a team from leith the very station now in charge of the shooting at port edgar academy and south queensferry just happened to be his constituency as if this wasnt enough to get tongues wagging one of the murder victims happened to be the son of a judge all of which led to the second reason why everyone at st leonards was talking they felt left out being a leith call rather than st leonards there was nothing to do but sit and watch hoping there might be a need to draft officers in but siobhan doubted it the case was cut and dried the gunmans body laid out in the morgue his two victims somewhere nearby it wouldnt be enough to deflect gill templer from ds clarke to the chief supers office the squawked imperative came from a loudspeaker attached to the ceiling above her head the uniforms in the cafeteria turned to look at her she tried to appear calm sipping from her can her insides suddenly felt coldnothing to do with the chilled drink ds clarke to the chief super the glass door was ahead of her beyond it her car sat obediently in its space what would rebus do run or hide she had to smile as the answer came to her hed do neither hed probably take the stairs two at a time on his way to the bosss office knowing he was right and she whatever she had to say to him was wrong siobhan dumped her can and headed for the stairs you know why i wanted you detective chief superintendent gill templer asked she was seated behind the desk in her office surrounded by the days paperwork as dcs templer was responsible for the whole of b division composed of three stations on the citys south side with st leonards as divisional hq it wasnt as hefty a workload as some though things would change when the scottish parliament finally moved into its purposebuilt complex at the foot of holyrood road templer already seemed to spend a disproportionate amount of time in meetings focused on the needs of the parliament siobhan knew that she hated this no police officer joined the force because of a fondness for paperwork yet more and more budgeting and finances were the topics of the day officers who could run their cases or their stations onbudget were prized specimens those who could actually underspend were seen as altogether rarer and more rarefied beings siobhan could see that it was taking its toll on gill templer she always had a slightly harried look about her glints of gray were showing in her hair she either hadnt noticed or couldnt find time these days to get them done time was defeating her it made siobhan wonder what price she would be asked to pay for climbing the career ladder always supposing that ladder was still visible after today templer seemed preoccupied with a search of her desk drawer eventually she gave up and closed it focusing her attention on siobhan as she did so she lowered her chin this had the effect of hardening her gaze but also siobhan couldnt help noticing of accentuating the folds of skin around the throat and mouth when templer moved in her chair her suit jacket creased below the breasts showing that shed gained some weight either too much fast food or too many dinners at evening functions with the brass siobhan whod been in the gym at six oclock that morning sat a little more upright in her own chair and lifted her head a little higher im assuming its about martin fairstone she said beating templer to the opening jab of the bout when templer stayed quiet she went in again i had nothing to do with wheres john templer interrupted sharply siobhan just swallowed hes not at his flat templer continued i sent someone round there to check yet according to you hes taken a couple of days sick leave where is he siobhan i the thing is two nights ago martin fairstone was seen in a bar nothing unusual in that except that his companion bore a striking resemblance to detective inspector john rebus couple of hours later fairstones being fried alive in the kitchen of his house she paused always supposing he was alive when the fire started maam i really dont john likes to look out for you doesnt he siobhan nothing wrong in that johns got this knightintarnishedarmor thing hasnt he always has to be looking for another dragon to fight this doesnt have anything to do with di rebus maam then whats he hiding from im not aware that hes hiding at all but youve seen him it was a question but only just templer allowed herself a winning smile id put money on it hes really not well enough to come in siobhan parried aware that her punches were losing much of their previous force if he cant come here im quite willing for you to take me to him siobhan felt her shoulders sag i need to talk to him first templer was shaking her head this isnt something you can negotiate siobhan according to you fairstone was stalking you he gave you that black eye siobhan raised an involuntary hand towards her left cheekbone the marks were fading she knew they were more like shadows now they could be hidden with makeup or explained by tiredness but she still saw them when she looked in the mirror now hes dead templer was continuing in a house fire possibly suspicious so you can see that i have to talk to anyone who saw him that night another pause when was the last time you saw him siobhan which onefairstone or di rebus both if you like siobhan didnt say anything her hands went to clasp the metal arms of her chair but she realized it had no arms a new chair less comfortable than the old one then she saw that templers chair was new too and set an inch or two higher than before a little trick to give her an edge over any visitor which meant the chief super felt the need of such props i dont think im prepared to answer maam siobhan paused with respect she got to her feet wondering whether shed sit down again if told to thats very disappointing ds clarke templers voice was cold no more first names youll tell john weve had a word if you want me to i expect youll want to get your stories straight prior to any inquiry siobhan acknowledged the threat with a nod all it needed was a request from the chief super and the complaints would come shuffling into view bringing with them their briefcases full of questions and skepticism the complaints full title the complaints and conduct department thank you maam was all siobhan said opening the door and closing it again behind her there was a toilet cubicle along the hall and she went and sat there for a while taking a small paper bag from her pocket and breathing into it the first time shed suffered a panic attack shed felt as if she was going into cardiac arrest heart pounding lungs giving out her whole body surging with electricity her doctor had said she should take some time off shed entered his office thinking he would recommend her to the hospital for tests but instead hed told her to buy a book about her condition shed found one in a pharmacy it listed every single one of her symptoms in its first chapter and made a few suggestions cut down on caffeine and alcohol eat less salt and fat try breathing into a paper bag if an attack seems imminent the doctor had said her blood pressure was a bit high suggested exercise so shed started coming into work an hour early spending that time in the gym the commonwealth pool was just down the road and shed promised herself shed start swimming there i eat fine shed told her doctor try making a list over the course of a week hed said so far she hadnt bothered and she kept forgetting her swimsuit too all too easy to blame martin fairstone fairstone in court on two chargeshousebreaking and assault one of the neighbors challenging him as he left the flat hed just looted fairstone smashing the womans head into a wall stamping on her face so hard the sole of one sneaker left its impression siobhan giving evidence doing her best but they hadnt recovered the shoe and none of the haul from the flat had turned up in fairstones home the neighbor had given a description of her attacker then had picked out fairstones mug shot later on choosing him again at the id parade there were problems which the procurator fiscals office had been quick to identify no evidence at the scene nothing to link fairstone to the crimes except an id and the fact that he was a known housebreaker with several convictions for assault the shoe would have been nice the fiscal depute had scratched at his beard and asked if they might try dropping either of the charges maybe do a deal and he gets a cuff round the ear and heads back home siobhan had argued in court it was pointed out to siobhan by the defense that the neighbors original description of her attacker bore little resemblance to the figure in the dock the victim herself fared little better admitting to a margin of uncertainty that the defense exploited to the full when giving her own evidence siobhan used as many hints as she could to let everyone know that the defendant had a history eventually the judge couldnt ignore the remonstrations by the defense counsel youre on a final warning detective sergeant clarke he had said so unless you have some reason why you wish to scupper the crowns chances in this case i suggest you choose your answers more carefully from now on fairstone had just glared at her knowing full well what she was trying to do and afterwards the notguilty verdict delivered hed bounded out of the court building as if there were springs in the heels of his brandnew sneakers hed grabbed siobhan by the shoulder to stop her from walking away thats assault shed told him trying not to show how furious and frustrated she felt thanks for helping me get off in there hed said maybe i can return the favor someday im off to the pub to celebrate whats your poison drop down the nearest sewer will you i think im in love a grin spreading to cover his narrow face someone called to him his girlfriend bottleblond hair black tracksuit pack of cigs in one hand mobile phone to her ear shed provided his alibi for the time of the attack so had two of his friends looks like youre wanted its you i want shiv you want me she waited till he nodded then invite me along next time youre going to beat up a complete stranger give me your phone number im in the bookunder police marty his girlfriends snarl be seeing you shiv still grinning he walked backwards for a few paces then turned away siobhan had headed straight back over to st leonards to reacquaint herself with his file an hour later the switchboard had put through a call it was him phoning from a bar shed put the receiver down ten minutes later hed called again and then another ten after that and the next day and the whole of the following week unsure at first how to play it she didnt know if her silences were working they just seemed to make him laugh made him try all the harder she prayed he would tire find something else to occupy him then he turned up at st leonards tried following her home shed spotted him that time led him a dance while summoning help on her mobile a patrol car had picked him up next day he was curbside again just outside the car park at the back of st leonards shed left him there exiting on foot instead by the front door taking a bus home still he wouldnt give up and she realized that what had started presumablyas a joke had turned into a more serious form of game so shed decided to bring one of her stronger pieces into play rebus had noticed anyway the calls she wasnt taking the time she spent by the office window the way she kept glancing around her when they were out on a call so eventually shed told him and the pair of them had paid a visit to fairstones public housing unit in gracemount it had started badly siobhan soon realizing that her piece played by his own set of rules rather than anyone elses a struggle the leg snapping from a coffee table pine veneer yielding to the mdf within siobhan feeling worse than ever afterwardsweak because she had brought rebus in rather than deal with it herself trembling because at the back of her mind lurked the thought that shed known what would happen and had wanted it to happen instigator and coward theyd stopped for a drink on the way back into town think hell do anything siobhan had asked he started it rebus told her if he keeps on hassling you he knows now what hes in for a hiding you mean all i did was defend myself siobhan you were there you saw his eyes fixing hers until she nodded and he was right fairstone had lunged at him rebus had pushed him down onto the coffee table trying to hold him there then the leg snapped and both men slid to the floor rolling and struggling it had all been over in a matter of seconds fairstones voice shaking with rage as he told them to get out rebus pointing a warning finger repeating his order to back off from ds clarke just clear out the pair of you her hand touching rebuss arm its finished lets go you think its finished flecks of white saliva spitting from the corners of fairstones mouth rebuss final words it better be pal unless you really want to start seeing some fireworks shed wanted to ask him what hed meant but instead had bought a final round of drinks in bed that night shed stared at the dark ceiling before falling into a doze waking with a sudden feeling of terror leaping to her feet adrenaline surging through her shed crawled on hands and knees from her bedroom believing that if she got to her feet she would die eventually it passed and she used her hands on the hallway wall as she rose up from the floor she walked slowly back to bed and lay down on her side curled into a ball more common than you might think her doctor would eventually tell her after the second attack between times martin fairstone made a complaint of harassment dropping it eventually and hed also kept on calling shed tried to keep it from rebus didnt want to know what he meant by fireworks the cid office was dead people were out on calls or busy in court it seemed you could spend half your life waiting to give evidence only for the case to collapse or the accused to make a change of plea sometimes a juror went awol or someone crucial was sick time seeped away and at the end of it all the verdict was not guilty even when found guilty it might be a question of a fine or suspended sentence the prisons were full and seen more than ever as a last resort siobhan didnt think she was growing cynical just realistic thered been criticism recently that edinburgh had more traffic wardens than cops when something like south queensferry came up it stretched things tighter holidays sick leave paperwork and courtand not nearly enough hours in any given day siobhan was aware that there was a backlog on her desk because of fairstone her work had been suffering she could still feel his presence if a phone rang she would freeze and a couple of times she caught herself heading for the window to check if his car was out there she knew she was being irrational but couldnt help it knew too that it wasnt the kind of thing she could talk to someone about not without seeming weak the phone was ringing now not on her own desk but on rebuss if no one answered the switchboard might try another extension she crossed the floor willing the sound to stop it did so only when she picked up the receiver hello whos that a male voice brisk businesslike ds clarke hiya shiv its bobby hogan here detective inspector bobby hogan shed asked him before not to call her shiv a lot of people tried it siobhan pronounced shivawn shortened to shiv when people wrote her name down it turned into all sorts of erroneous spellings she remembered that fairstone had called her shiv a few times attempting familiarity she hated it and knew she should correct hogan but she didnt keeping busy she asked instead you know im handling port edgar he broke off course you do stupid question you come over well on tv bobby im always open to flattery shiv and the answer is no she couldnt help smiling im not exactly snowed under here she lied glancing across at the folders on her desk if i need an extra pair of hands ill let you know is john around mr popular hes taken a sickie what do you want him for is he at home i can probably get a message to him she was intrigued now there was some urgency in hogans voice you know where he is yes where you never answered my question what do you want him for hogan gave a long sigh because i need that other pair of hands he told her and only his will do so far as i know im suitably crushed he ignored her tone how soon can you let him know he might not be well enough to help if hes anywhere short of an iron lung ill take him she rested her weight against rebuss desk whats going on just get him to call me eh are you at the school best if he tries my mobile bye shiv hang on a sec siobhan was looking towards the doorway what hogan failed to mask his exasperation hes just here ill put him on she stretched the receiver out towards rebus his clothes all seemed to be hanging awkwardly at first she thought he must be drunk but then she realized what it was hed struggled to get dressed his shirt was tucked into his waistband but only just his tie hung loose around his neck instead of taking the phone from her he came forward and leaned his ear against it its bobby hogan she explained hiya bobby john connection must be breaking up rebus looked at siobhan bit closer he whispered she angled the mouthpiece so it rested against his chin noting that his hair needed washing it was plastered to his scalp in the front but sticking up in the back that better bobby fine yes john i need a favor when the phone dipped a little rebus looked up at siobhan her gaze was directed at the doorway again he glanced around and saw gill templer standing there my office she snapped now rebus ran the tip of his tongue around his lips i think im going to have to call you back bobby boss wants a word he straightened up hearing hogans voice becoming tinny and mechanical templer was beckoning for him to follow he gave a little shrug in siobhans direction and began to leave the room again hes gone she told the mouthpiece well get him back i dont think thats going to be possible lookmaybe if you could give me a clue what this is all about i might be able to help ill leave it open if you dont mind rebus said if you want the whole station to hear thats fine by me rebus slumped down on the visitors chair its just that im having a bit of trouble with door handles he lifted his hands for templer to see her expression changed immediately christ john what the hell happened i scalded myself looks worse than it is scalded yourself she leaned back fingers pressing the edge of the desk he nodded theres no more to it than that despite what im thinking despite what youre thinking i filled the kitchen sink to do some dishes forgot i hadnt added cold and plunged my hands in for how long exactly long enough to scald them apparently he tried for a smile reckoned the dishes story was easier to swallow than the bathtub despite which templer looked far from convinced her phone started ringing she picked up the receiver and dropped it again cutting the connection youre not the only one having some bad luck martin fairstone died in a fire siobhan told me and accident with a chip pan he shrugged it happens you were with him sunday night was i witnesses saw you together in a bar rebus shrugged i did chance to bump into him and left the bar with him no went back to his place says who john his voice was rising who says it wasnt an accident the fire investigators are still looking good luck to them rebus made to fold his arms realized what he was doing and dropped them to either side again that probably hurts templer commented its bearable and it happened on sunday night he nodded look john she leaned forwards elbows on the desktop you know what people are going to say siobhan claimed fairstone was stalking her he denied it then countered that youd threatened him a charge he decided to drop but now i hear from siobhan that fairstone attacked her did you know about that he shook his head the fires just a stupid coincidence she lowered her eyes it doesnt look good though does it rebus made a show of examining himself since when have i been interested in looking good despite herself she almost smiled i just want to know that were clean on this trust me gill then you wont mind making it all official get it down in writing her phone had started ringing again id answer it this time a voice said siobhan was standing in the hallway arms folded templer looked at her then picked up the receiver dcs templer speaking siobhan caught rebuss eye and gave a wink gill templer was listening to whatever the caller was telling her i seeyesi suppose that would becare to tell me why him exactly rebus suddenly knew it was bobby hogan maybe not on the phone hogan could have gone over templers head got the deputy chief constable to make the call on his behalf needing that favor from rebus hogan had a certain measure of power right now power gifted him along with his latest case rebus wondered what sort of favor he wanted templer put down the phone youre to report to south queensferry seems di hogan needs his handholding she was staring at her desktop thank you maam rebus said fairstone wont be going anywhere john remember that soon as hogans finished with you youre mine again understood templer looked past him to where siobhan was still standing meantime maybe ds clarke will shed some light rebus cleared his throat might be a problem there maam in what way rebus held up his arms again and turned his wrists slowly i might be all right for holding bobby hogans hand but ill need a bit of help for everything else he half turned in the chair so if i could just borrow ds clarke for a little while i can get you a driver templer snapped but for writing notes making and taking callsneeds to be cid and from what i saw in the office that narrows things down he paused with your permission get out then the pair of you templer made a show of reaching for some paperwork soon as theres news from the fire investigators ill let you know very decent of you boss rebus said rising to his feet back in the cid room he had siobhan slide a hand into his jacket pocket bringing out a small plastic jar of pills bastards measured them out like gold he complained get me some water will you she fetched a bottle from her desk and helped him wash down two tablets when he demanded a third she checked the label says to take two every four hours one more wont do any harm not going to last long at this rate theres a prescription in my other pocket well stop at a chemists once were on the road she screwed the top of the jar back on thanks for taking me with you no problem he paused want to talk about fairstone not particularly fair enough im assuming neither of us is responsible her eyes bored into his correct he said which means we can concentrate on helping bobby hogan instead but theres one last thing before we start what any chance you could do my tie properly nurse hadnt a clue she smiled ive
