 nawat stood against the wall relaxed and alert before him two menatarms were preparing to shoot dove stood behind one archer with a handful of arrows while the duchess held arrows for the second archer aly8217s mind told her that the duchess would hardly consent to murder just as the first man shot the second man shot immediately after him then both set fresh arrows to the string and shot steadily arrow after arrow one at a time until they had exhausted all the extras held by the duchess and her stepdaughter nawat caught them all with grace and ease snatching the arrows from the air as if he had all day to do so when the archers finished he gathered the heap of arrows at his feet and carried them back to their owners he8217s so fast aly thought in awe i couldn8217t do it and i8217m no slouch she sighed wishing da were here to see it he8217d taught her to catch daggers in midair but this game was much more hazardous the game was not done the menatarms repeated the experiment with javelins then hunting and combat spears nawat caught them all moving so fast aly couldn8217t follow his hands she cheered him and the menatarms on when the bell rang to remind the household it was nearly time for supper he looked up at the applauding aly and waved 8220this is my favorite game8221 he called to her 8220do you want to play8221 8220i wouldn8217t dare8221 she cried laughing before she retreated into the room she8217d seen men catch knives before she had seen the finest archers in the queen8217s riders draw an outline in arrows of someone positioned against a wooden fence or wall just to show they could do it she had never seen anything like this sarai and dove ran in sarai smiled at aly 8220you should have seen your face did you know he could do that8221 she asked as she collapsed on her bed dove unstrung her bow shaking her head 8220he8217s amazing8221 she said coiling her bowstring 8220you know maybe this horrible old place isn8217t so bad8221 sarai told the ceiling 8220not if these wonderful men keep showing up8221 aly raised an eyebrow at her 8220i wouldn8217t try kissing him8221 she warned 8220it wouldn8217t be what you expect8221 sarai wrinkled her nose 8220aly8221 she complained 8220i found out he eats bugs i8217m not kissing a man with bug breath8221 aly blinked i don8217t remember him tasting of bugs when he kissed me she thought i8217d better pay more attention next time her mind promptly reined her up this was highly improper there would be no next time her task was looking after the balitang children not mooning over someone particularly not a crow turned man even if he could pluck arrows from the air the next morning aly still on a goatherd8217s hours walked out of the keep into the dawn the sun had just cleared the walls to light the inner courtyard and the young man who straddled a bench there aly stopped to watch him carefully glue pieces of feather onto the wooden shaft nawat looked up at her with a smile that lit his eyes 8220you are beautiful in the new light8221 he told her 8220if i were the dawn crow i would bring you the sun to hatch as our first nestling8221 aly blinked at him her heart felt strangely squeezed by some powerful emotion she bit her lip to distract herself from a feeling that made her horribly unsure 8220have you been kissing anybody8221 she asked without meaning to and gasped she had let words out of her mouth without thinking which was not like her worse they were such personal words ones he might feel meant personal feelings she did not have this was the kind of thing that other girls said those girls who were not bored by all the young men who had courted them how many handsome fellows had sighed compliments to aly while unconcerned she had mentally wrestled with breaking a new code at home she never cared about her suitors enough to worry if they kissed other girls she scrambled to blot out what she8217d said 8220not that it8217s any of my business but you should understand people have a way of kissing for fun without it meaning anything serious and i8217d hate for you to think someone wanted you to matefeed them just because they8217re kissing82128221 stop babbling her mind ordered aly stopped nawat8217s smile broadened that disturbing light in his eyes deepened 8220i have kissed no one but you aly8221 he assured her serious 8220why should i kiss anyone else8221 aly gulped you can continue this conversation or you can talk about something less giddy she told herself less frightening 8220you know i won8217t always be around8221 she said abruptly 8220i don8217t belong here really8221 8220then i will go with you8221 nawat said 8220i belong with you8221 he doesn8217t know what he8217s saying aly told herself he doesn8217t know what that means she looked at him arms folded trying to keep any extra feelings from leaping out 8220what are you doing8221 she asked to change the subject to anything less dangerous then she grimaced he was fletching arrows as always she glanced at his bench then bent down he was fletching but these arrows were heavier and the feathers he used were not bird feathers but stormwing 8220how did you cut them up8221 she wanted to know genuinely curious more scraps of cutup steel feathers lay on the bench nawat pointed to a long piece of what looked like black chipped glass 8220shiny volcano rock8221 he told aly 8220chip the edge until it is sharp that cuts stormwing feathers they come from the heat of the place where stormwings were born8221 aly touched the glassy blade 8220obsidian8221 she said 8220that8217s its name8221 8220yes8221 nawat replied 8220shiny volcano rock8221 he set a length of steel feather into a thin groove filled with glue and held it in place aly didn8217t see a single cut on his hands though the feathers were lethally sharp 8220won8217t they be too heavy for the glue8221 she asked 8220i shaped the glue it holds stormwing feathers8221 nawat answered 8220stormwings really are born in volcanoes8221 aly inquired curious 8220in the beginning time when they were first dreamed8221 replied nawat setting another piece of steel feather in its slot 8220now if carrying an egg does not kill the mother they are born from steel eggs8221 he looked at aly and sighed his dark eyes wistful 8220the eggs are too heavy for a crow to take8221 8220you8217ve already taken enough from stormwings8221 aly told him pointing to the small pile of glinting feathers beside his bench 8220you could have been killed8221 8220there is a trick to it8221 he replied and blew lightly on his fletchings holding the arrow shaft before one eye he squinted down its length 8220perfect8221 he declared and set the arrow down 8220it seems like a lot of trouble and risk when goose feathers are safer to work with8221 aly remarked 8220what is a stormwingfletched arrow for anyway8221 8220they are mage killers8221 replied nawat 8220no matter if the mage is powerful if he has great spells to protect him a stormwing arrow will cut through illusion and magic8221 aly whistled softly impressed 8220take very good care of those then8221 she told nawat 8220we might find a use for them8221 8220i made them for you8221 nawat said giving her that radiant innocent smile 8220they are yours for a day when they will help you8221 he offered a finished arrow shaft to her aly smiled at him despite the goose bumps that rippled along her skin 8220keep them until they8217re needed please8221 she told him 8220my archery skills aren8217t very good8221 8220you could practice8221 nawat pointed out 8220i8217m a slave8221 aly explained 8220slaves who are caught with weapons are killed8221 8220then do not be a slave8221 he said matteroffactly 8220fly free8221 8220not just yet8221 she replied 8220i8217ll see the summer out first8221
