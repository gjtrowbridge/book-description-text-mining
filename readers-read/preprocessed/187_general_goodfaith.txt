 chapter 1 this would be 82 i was out at the viceroy with bobby baldwin bobby baldwin was my one employee which made us not quite friends but we went out to the viceroy almost every night my marriage was finished and his hadnt started so we spent a lot of time together that most everyone else we knew was spending with their families i didnt mind my business card had the viceroys number in the corner under quotmay also be reached atquot buyers called me there it was a good sign if they wanted to see a house again in what you might call the middle of the night that meant they couldnt wait till morning and if they wanted to see it again in the middle of the nightwell i did my best to show it to them that was the difference between bobby and me he always said quottheir motivation needs to be tested thats what i think let em wait a little bitquot bobby was not my brother but he might as well have been sally his sister had been my girlfriend in high school for about a year and a half she was the first person i ever knew who had a phone of her own she used to call me up and tell me what to do quotnow joeyquot she would say quottomorrow wear those tan pants youve got and the blue socks with the clocks on them and your white shirt and that green sweater i gave you and i am going to wear my blue circle skirt with the matching cashmere sweater and ill meet you on the steps well look great have you done your algebra problems when you get to number four the variable is seven and x equals half of y if you remember that then you wont have a problem with it did you wash your face yet dont forget to use that stuff i bought you rub it in clockwise just a little tiny dab about the size of the tip of your pencil eraser okayquot i had been short and now i was tall i had been skinny and quiet and religious and now i was goodlooking and muscular it was sally baldwin who brought me along told me what to wear and do and think and say she was never wrong she never lost her patience she created me and when she was done we broke up in a formal sense but she kept calling me she was smart and went off to smith college and i was sure she would get everything organized there once and for all i went to penn state in april of my freshman year sally was killed in a car accident outside of boston i had talked to her two days before quotnow joeyquot she had said quotits okay to see a woman who is almost thirty but you dont say that you are dating her you say that you are seeing her seeing is much more sophisticated than dating and it doesnt lead to marriagequot i went home for the funeral it was as if the baldwins had been eviscerated all they had left were felicity norton leslie and bobby that didnt seem like much without sally to move them along betty their mom couldnt act of her own free will the funeral director pat mahoney had to seat her here and stand her there and remove her from this spot and place her in that spot gordon seemed better almost vigilant in a way though my mother said he would never recover and maybe he never did bobby was ten then nine years younger than i was gordon came up to me afterward and asked me how i was doing he was concerned the way you always get at funerals and i couldnt help telling him that i wasnt doing at all welli hated college and was terribly homesick anyway and now there was this stunning thing that was the end of sallyand the next thing i knew he was offering me a job and i was taking it and i went back to pick up my stuff at penn state two days after the funeral and i started working for gordon the following monday which i certainly would not have been invited to do if sally were alive and my girlfriend or fiancee because gordon didnt like to be bankrolling everyone in the whole family especially not sonsinlaw my dad used to wonder what the baldwins real name was they werent like any baldwins he had ever known gordon was loud and affectionate hey honey he always said no matter who he was talking to he ate out every night he had three or four restaurants he took everyone to owned by his poker buddies i think he played poker twice a week high stakes these games had been going for generations for a living he bought and sold things for a while it was antiques for a while jewelry for a while cars for a while expensive fixtures out of houses and restaurants and hotels that were being torn down once in a while he would hear about some hotel in the city that was going under and he would come home with a truckload of dishes or silver that carried a hotel monogram one year his barn was full of pink silk chairs and settees from the lobby of a hotel in montreal another year he got a thousand commodes that was the year he persuaded everyone who bought a house from us that quotyou got to have one more bathroom than the number of bedrooms its the wave of the futurequot always land and houses and dairycattle breeding stock one thing leads to another that is houses lead to commodes and then commodes lead to houses which lead to land which leads to dairy cattle which lead to cheese which leads to pizza pies which lead to manicotti and veal parmesan which lead to wine which leads to love which leads to babies houses and commodes that was gordon baldwin in a nutshell my father who didnt like anything to lead to anything else because of sin couldnt decide whether the baldwins had originally been quotobolenskisquot or quotbalduccisquot or quotbaldagyisquot he took solace in the fact that we were stratfords always had been stratfords there was no misspelling of the stratford name since the middle ages the baldwins had come to town after the war that was all anyone knew and for all that gordon had gotten rich and locally famous and he bobby and everyone else in the family talked and talked where the baldwins had come from was something they never talked about anyway i could hardly keep my eyes open though it was only midnight early for a baldwin and bobby was wide awake he was drinking and playing craps for pennies with a builder we knew the bar was about half full it was a wednesday i said quotsee you at tenquot bobby said quotsee that a five and a three thats eightquot quotbobbyquot i said quotten i have to show a house at tenfifteen and i want to be sure youre there before i goquot quottenquot said bobby quotten in the morningquot quotin the morningquot quotmorning is when the sun is in the sky and you dont have to turn on your headlightsquot quotgot you roll emquot he looked at me and smiled he looked just like betty i shook my head as i passed next to the table right behind where we had been sitting i saw a guy look up look at me i went out into the parking lot the parking lot of the viceroy backed up on the river the nut my condo was in a development in a smaller town upriver nut hollow instead of getting right into my car i walked down to the river and had a look at the moon which was shining round and bright the river was black and glassy around the circle of the moon for just a single long moment then the wind came up and ruffled the image i saw there was a woman squatting at the base of a tree about ten yards from the river when she turned at my footsteps i realized it was fern minette bobbys fiancee she stood up with a big smile wiping her hands on her jeans fern was about twentyseven or so she and bobby had been engaged for four and a half years i said quotwell its fern what are you doing ferniequot quotcat entrapmentquot quotyoure trapping catsquot quotwell my cat he got out of the car when i took him to the grocery store fridayquot she pointed to a cat carrier with its door open just barely visible in a cleft up the bank from the river quoti put things in there liver his toys last night he went in but when i moved away from the tree he ran out againquot she sighed i said quotbobbys in the viceroy maybe he would help you hes not doing anything productivequot quotyou cant help with a cat a cat cant be herded a cat has to be attracted i just cant figure out the thing that would do it and as the nights go by it gets harder you should go away anywayquot quotdo you stay out here all nightquot quottill two then i come back at six go away he might be watching me and making up his mindquot i got in my car and shut the door when i turned on my headlights fern waved then hunkered down beside the tree the strangest thing about bobby and fern was that they had actually discussed marriage neither one was the sort of person you could image having any life plan that would lead to regular hours a house and then children who accepted them as parents bobby was still on my mind when i got up to go to the office in the morning probably because i was annoyed in advance that he would be late and i would have to rush to my appointment it was a sharp but clear spring morning not quite to the daffodil stage the sky was a cold bluegray but the grass had greened up on the hillsides and it seemed like you could see each blade shining with chlorophyll it was the sort of day where houses look great especially brick houses and i had a brick house to show one with a big front lawn and a newly blacktopped driveway the surprise was that bobby was at the office in a jacket and a tie and he had the multiple listing book out of his desk wide open to the listings in the high onehundreds in those days that was the back of the book and there were some nice houses there houses up in rollins hills with five and six bedrooms and subzero refrigerators i remember i showed a house up there with its own little saunasteam room the buyers and i stood in our shoes in the bathroom turning the seven dials and staring into the little woodpaneled cubbyhole like wed never seen running water before anyway bobby was deep in the rollins hills listings as soon as i walked in he said quotguess what this guy in the bar last night hes moving out from the city im taking him out this morning eleventhirty he wants to see seven houses today and seven tomorrow and then hes going to pick you should have hung around but im glad you didnt he was thisquot quotdarkhaired guy in a gray jacketquot quotyeahquot quotthats funny he looked up at me when i was leavingquot quotpeople always look at you when youre leaving the viceroy theyre looking at you in disbeliefquot quottheyre looking at you in shame bob anyway did you see fern she was out there trying to catch her catquot quotshes never going to catch that cat that cat has been trying to escape for five years you know when she moved into her apartment that cat had the vermin cleaned out in a month here he isquot a cadillac pulled into our little lot and eased between my lincoln and bobbys new bmw baldwin development bought a fleet of cars every two years always whatever some crony of gordons was just getting into after the new year rollins hills motors had gotten the bmw franchise and stu grade had sold gordon six bmws over a poker game bobbys was red the local sheriff had been informed that bobbys was the red one the guy who got out of the caddy was very smooth lookingcreased tan slacks expensivelooking white shirt italiancut jacket tasseled loafers he pocketed his keys and threw his sunglasses down on the seat of his car then glanced around for our door when he saw me looking at him through the plate glass he broke into a smile there was no one with him house deals without women put you out into unknown territory sometimes that was especially true in those days when most buyers were families moving around the county to nicer houses or out to the country from the city but bobby needed something to do with his time and i thought an iffy client was better than any one of his usual six activitiessleeping late going to the viceroy going to the doctor going to the dentist doing repairs around his own place or calling gordon and asking for something to do it was this last that had resulted in bobbys employment at my office bobby was wellmeaning and even smart but he was a danger to himself and others simply because he couldnt use any sort of tool or even do anything outside of his normal routine without hurting himself or getting sick if it wasnt a broken toe from stumbling over a stack of weights at the gym then it was poison ivy all over his face from taking fern on a hike or some sort of food poisoning gordon said to me quotthat kid could put his eye out with a hammer or break his leg with a screwdriver real estate is the safest place for himquot and it was but i didnt think he would be any match for this marcus burns to whom he was now introducing me my clients were or would soon be waiting my clients were careful buyers the sloans i made a living in real estate by keeping track of what a buyer wanted and doing researchgoing to every open house calling other agents visiting model homes just in general mastering as many features of as many listings as i couldbut you couldnt get ahead of the sloans what they wanted to know about every house they looked at even the ones they didnt like defied preparation they had been looking for four months not an inordinately long time but they had seen every house on the market in their price range and now they just waited for new listings usually at some point you gave up on people like that because you knew they would never buy the one thing that made me think the sloans would eventually go for something was their conviction that something valuable or even precious was out there the more i assured them we were on top of every available property the more worried they got that we were missing one i thought the tension would eventually become too much for them to bear needless to say they were prequalified in every way the mortgagor was dying to lend them money
