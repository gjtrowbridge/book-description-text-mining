 chapter one it was a wellknown fact among those in the british diplomatic corps that whenever his majesty king william iv had a sticky situation on his hands sir ian moore would get the assignment no one else had a chance it was true that sir ian thirtyfive years of age had a successful decadelong career as a diplomat it was true that he was unmarried unfettered and willing to be a roving ambassador able to go wherever duty to king and country sent him of course it was true that his loyalty and honor were beyond question but during this time of peace in europe truly sticky situations where a diplomat could make his mark were rare and many of sir ians colleagues wished his majestys favorite ambassador would retire to his estate in devonshire and give the rest of them a chance to shine the turks and greeks were a perfect example those people would test the mettle of any diplomat so when a minor skirmish between those factions threatened to break into allout war no one was surprised when sir ian was sent to anatolia but everyone was surprised when scarcely a fortnight after his arrival in constantinople he was recalled to gibraltar ambitious young diplomats crossed their fingers hoping that somehow some way ian moore had finally blotted his copybook ian knew his copybook was still quite satisfactory as to the reason for his recall from the east however even ian had to confess he was baffled why fetch me to gibraltar he wondered aloud sitting in his cabin aboard the mary eliza one of his britannic majestys finest and fastest ships of the line as the ship carried him across the mediterranean ian studied the map of europe spread out on the table before him what could it mean his valet harper looked up from the shirt he was mending it must be very serious indeed for them to send for you so suddenly something big is happening i cannot imagine what the turkish situation is the only thing of significance in this part of the world at present and they intend to replace me in the middle of it to what end all i know is its a shame there we were in constantinople just settled in for a good long stay and then in the wink of an eye theres a change of plan and were sailing off again harper shook his head with a sigh of regret pity that he added mighty fetching those turkish ladies looked in those trousers and those veils of theirs makes a man wonder whats underneath the sultan was going to give you one of his slave girls you know harper a true british gentleman would never own a slave girl barbaric practice maybe so sir but one of those turkish girls would have worked on you like a tonic not to say youve been shorttempered of late but thats absurd ian shot back nettled i have not been shorttempered if you say so but you have been working hard for many months and havent had any time for ladies he paused then added a man needs what he needs you know ian did not want to think about how long it had been since his needs in that particular area had been met too long he shot a warning glance at the servant harper thats enough any more impudence from you and i shall begin a search for a new valet the manservant who had been valeting him since his fifteenth birthday wasnt the least bit intimidated the censure in ians voice slid off him like water off a duck do you a world of good to loosen your cravat once in a while sir if you dont mind my saying so i do mind ian drummed his fingers against the table focusing his thoughts on important matters why fetch me to gibraltar he wondered again as he considered and rejected various possibilities morocco is stable things in spain are quiet as for the french well our relations with them arent good but thats nothing new i cannot imagine what the trouble is something to do with those italians again i say ian hoped not i dont see how that is possible the italian situation is resolved the treaty of bolgheri has been signed the congress of vienna remains intact and princess elena will be marrying the duke of ausberg when she reaches the age of twentyone talk is she doesnt want to marry him she will do her duty she has no choice harper shrugged thats as may be but girls are most unaccountable sir especially the italian ones he added with feeling its the temperament if there was anyone who ought to understand the italian temperament it was ian hed spent a lot of time in that part of the world these past few years pouring the soothing words of diplomacy over the prince of bolgheri and the dukes of venezia lombardy and tuscany to preserve peace in the region and keep italian nationalists from rebelling against the austrian empire but despite his many trips to the region he did not understand the italians he found their passions too dramatic and their moods too volatile for his fastidious british nature ian gave up his speculations as a futile exercise and rolled up the map regardless of where they proposed to send him he would do his duty he always did nonetheless when the mary eliza arrived at gibraltar and ian presented himself at government house he could not help being surprised by his next assignment youre sending me to london not i sir ian lord stanton corrected him these orders are from the prime minister himself you are to depart for home at once i have dispatched sir gervase humphrey to constantinople to take your place and deal with the turkish situation
