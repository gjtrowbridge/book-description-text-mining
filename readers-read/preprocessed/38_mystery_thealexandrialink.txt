go online and open your email8221 had he heard right go online and open your email he flipped open the phone and checked the frequency enough megahertz to make it worldcapable which made him wonder suddenly he felt vulnerable h248jbro plads was quiet at this late hour no one roamed the city square his senses came alive 8220get inside8221 and he yanked her into the shop and closed the door he hadn8217t switched on any lights 8220what is it8221 she asked her voice shredded by fear he faced her 8220i don8217t know pam you tell me our son has apparently been taken by godknowswho and you wait

glanced nervously around at the shelves cast in shadows 8220upstairs right8221 gary would have told her he lived over the store he certainly hadn8217t they8217d spoken only once since he8217d retired from the justice department and left georgia last year and that had been two months back in august when he8217d brought gary home after their summer visit she8217d coldly told him that gary was not his natural son instead the boy was the product of an affair from sixteen years ago her response to his own infidelity he8217d wrestled with that demon ever since and had not as yet come to terms with its implications one thing he8217d decided at the time8212he had no intention of ever speaking to pam malone again whatever needed to be said would be said between him and gary but things seemed to have changed 8220yeah8221 he said 8220upstairs8221 they entered his apartment and he sat at the desk he switched on his laptop and waited for the programs to boot pam had finally grabbed hold of her emotions she was like that her moods ran in waves soaring highs and cavernous lows she was a lawyer like him but where he8217d worked for the government she handled highstakes trials for fortune 500 companies that could afford to pay her firm8217s impressive fees when she8217d first gone to law school he8217d thought the decision a reflection of him a way for them to share a life together later he8217d learned it was a way for her to gain independence that was pam the laptop was ready he accessed his mailbox empty 8220nothing here8221 pam rushed toward him 8220what do you mean he said to open your email8221 8220that was two days ago and by the way how did you get here8221 8220they had a ticket already bought8221 he couldn8217t believe what he was hearing 8220are you nuts what you did was give them a twoday head start8221 8220don8217t you think i know that8221 she yelled 8220you think i8217m a complete idiot they told me my phones were tapped and i was being watched if i varied from their instructions even a little gary was dead they showed me a picture8221 she caught herself and tears flowed anew 8220his eyes oh his eyes8221 she broke down again 8220he was scared8221 his chest throbbed and his temples burned he8217d intentionally left behind a life of daily danger to find something new had that life now hunted him down he grabbed the edge of the desk it would do no good for both of them to fall apart if whoever they were wanted gary dead then he was already no gary was a bargaining chip8212a way to apparently gain his undivided attention the laptop dinged his gaze shot to the screen8217s lowerright corner receiving mail then he saw greetings appear on the from line and your son8217s life noted as the subject he maneuvered the cursor and opened the email you have something i want the alexandria link you hid it and you8217re the only person on earth who knows where to find it go get it you have 72 hours when you have it hit the number 2 button on the phone if i don8217t hear from you at the end of 72 hours you will be childless if during that time you screw with me your son will lose a vital appendage 72 hours find it and we8217ll trade pam was standing behind him 8220what8217s the alexandria link8221 he said nothing he couldn8217t he was indeed the only person on earth who knew and he8217d given his word 8220whoever sent that message knows all about it what is it8221 he stared at the screen and knew there8217d be no way to trace the message the sender like himself surely knew how to use black holes8212computer servers that randomly routed emails through an electronic maze not impossible to follow but difficult he stood from the chair and ran a hand through his hair he8217d meant to get a haircut yesterday he worked the sleep from his shoulders and sucked a few deep breaths he8217d earlier slipped on a pair of jeans and a longsleeved shirt that hung open exposing a gray undershirt and he was suddenly chilled by fear 8220dammit cotton82128221 8220pam shut up i have to think you8217re not helping8221 8220i8217m not helping what the82128221 the cell phone rang pam lunged for it but he cut her off and said 8220leave

accent 8220and please no ifyouhurtthatboyi8217mgoingtokillyou bra vado neither one of us has the time your seventytwo hours have already started8221 malone stayed silent but he recalled something he learned long ago never let the other side set the bargain 8220stick it up your ass i8217m not going anywhere8221 8220you take a lot of risks with your son8217s life8221 8220i see gary i talk to him then i go8221 8220take a look outside8221 he rushed to the window four stories down h248jbro plads was still quiet except for two figures standing on the far side of the cobbled expanse both silhouettes shouldered weapons grenade launchers 8220don8217t think so8221 the voice said in his ear two projectiles shot through the night and obliterated the windows below him both exploded
