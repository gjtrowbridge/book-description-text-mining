 nbsp chapter excerpt the recruits tried to sleep occasionally someone belched or expelled wind noisily and polly responded with a few fake eructations of her own that seemed to inspire greater effort on the part of the other sleepers to the point where the roof rattled and dust fell down before everyone subsided once or twice she heard people stagger out into the windy darkness in theory for the privy but probably given male impatience in these matters to aim much closer to home once coasting in and out of a troubled dream she thought she heard someone sobbing taking care not to rustle too much polly pulled out the muchfolded muchread muchstained last letter from her brother and read it by the light of the solitary guttering candle it had been opened and heavily mangled by the censors and bore the stamp of the duchy it read dear all we are in which is with a big thing with knobs on we with which is just as well because out of i am keeping well the food is well at the but my mate er says not to worry itll be all over by and we shall all have medals chins up paul it was in a careful hand the excessively clear and wellshaped writing of someone who had to think about every letter she folded it up again paul had wanted medals because they were shiny thatd been almost a year ago when any recruiting party that came past went away with the best part of a battalion and there had been people waving them off with flags and music sometimes now smaller parties of men came back the lucky ones were missing only one arm or one leg there were no flags she unfolded the other piece of paper it was a pamphlet it was headed quotfrom the mothers of borograviaquot the mothers of borogravia were very definite about wanting to send their sons off to war against the zlobenian aggressor and used a great many exclamation points to say so and this was odd because the mothers in the town had not seemed keen on the idea of their sons going off to war and positively tried to drag them back several copies of the pamphlet seemed to have reached every home even so it was very patriotic that is it talked about killing foreigners shed learned to read and write after a fashion because the inn was big and it was a business and things had to be tallied and recorded her mother had taught her to read which was acceptable to nuggan and her father made sure that she learned how to write which was not a woman who could write was an abomination unto nuggan according to father jupe anything she wrote would by definition be a lie but polly had learned anyway because paul hadnt at least to the standard needed to run an inn as busy as the duchess he could read if he could run his finger slowly along the lines and he wrote letters painfully slowly with a lot of care and heavy breathing like a man assembling a piece of jewelry he was big and kind and slow and could lift beer kegs as though they were toys but he wasnt a man at home with paperwork their father had hinted to polly very gently but very often that polly would need to be right behind him when the time came for him to run the duchess left to himself with no one to tell him what to do next her brother just stood and watched birds at pauls insistence shed read the whole of quotfrom the mothers of borograviaquot to him including the bits about heroes and there being no greater good than to die for your country she wished now she hadnt done that paul did what he was told unfortunately he believed what he was told too she put the papers away and dozed again until her bladder woke her up oh well at least at this time of the morning shed have a clear run she reached out for her pack and stepped as softly as she could out into the rain it was mostly just coming off the trees now which were roaring in the wind that blew up the valley the moon was hidden in the clouds but there was just enough light to make out the inns buildings a certain grayness suggested that what passed for dawn in pln was on the way she located the mens privy which indeed stank of inaccuracy a lot of planning and practice had gone into this moment she was helped by the design of her breeches which were the oldfashioned kind with generous buttoned trapdoors and also by the experiments shed made very early in the mornings when she was doing the cleaning in short with care and attention to detail shed found that a woman could pee standing up it certainly worked back home in the inns privy which had been designed and built with the certain expectation of the aimlessness of the customers the wind shook the dank building in the dark she thought of aunty hattie whod gone a bit strange around her sixtieth birthday and persistently accused passing young men of looking up her dress she was even worse after a glass of wine and she had one joke quotwhat does a man stand up to do a woman sit down to do and a dog lift its leg to doquot and then when everyone was too embarrassed to answer shed triumphantly shriek quotshake handsquot and fall over aunty hattie was an abomination all by herself polly buttoned up the breeches with a sense of exhilaration she felt shed crossed a bridge a sensation that was helped by the realization that shed kept her feet dry someone said quotpsstquot it was just as well shed already taken a leak panic instantly squeezed every muscle where were they hiding this was just a rotten old shed oh there were a few cubicles but the smell alone suggested very strongly that the woods outside would be a much better proposition even on a wild night even with extra wolves quotyesquot she quavered and then cleared her throat and demanded with a little more gruffnessquot yes quot quotyoud need thesequot whispered the voice in the fetid gloom she made out something rising over the top of the cubicle she reached up nervously and touched softness it was a bundle of wool her fingers explored it quota pair of socks quot she said quotright wear emquot said the mystery voice hoarsely quotthank you but ive brought several pairs quot polly began there was a faint sigh quotno not on your feet shove em down the front of your trousersquot quotwhat do you meanquot quotlookquot said the whisperer patiently quotyou dont bulge where you shouldnt bulge thats good but you dont bulge where you should bulge either you know lower downquot quotoh er i but i didnt think people noticed quot said polly glowing with embarrassment she had been spotted but there was no hue and cry no angry quotations from the book of nuggan someone was helping someone who had seen her quotits a funny thingquot said the voice quotbut they notice whats missing more than they notice whats there just one pair mark you dont get ambitiousquot polly hesitated quotum is it obviousquot she said quotno thats why i gave you the socksquot quoti meant that that im not that im quot quotnot reallyquot said the voice in the dark quotyoure pretty good you come over as a frightened young lad trying to look big and brave you might pick your nose a bit more often just a tip few things interest a young man more than the contents of his nostrils now ive got a favor to ask you in returnquot i didnt ask you for one polly thought quite annoyed at being taken for being a frightened young lad when she was quite sure shed come over as quite a cool nonruffled young lad but she said calmly quotwhat is itquot quotgot any paperquot wordlessly polly pulled quotfrom the mothers of borograviaquot out of her shirt and handed it up she heard the sound of a match striking and a sulfurous smell that only improved the general conditions quotwhy is this the escutcheon of her grace the duchess i see in front of mequot said the whisperer quotwell it wont be in front of me for long beat it boyquot polly hurried out into the night shocked dazed confused and almost asphyxiated and made it to the shed door but shed barely shut it behind her and was blinking in the blackness when it was thrust open again to let in the wind rain and corporal strappi quotall right all right hands off well you lot wouldnt be able to find em and on with socks hup hup hi ho hup hup quot bodies were suddenly springing up or falling over all around polly their muscles must have been obeying the voice directly because no brain could have got into gear that quickly corporal strappi in obedience to the law of noncommissioned officers responded by making the confusion more confusing quotgood grief a lot of old women could shift bettern youquot he shouted with satisfaction as people flailed around looking for their coats and boots quotfall in get shaved every man in the regiment to be clean shaven by order get dressed wazzer ive got my eye on you move move breakfast in five minutes last one there doesnt get a sausage oh deary me what a bloody shower quot the four lesser apocalyptical horsemen of panic bewilderment ignorance and shouting took control of the room to corporal strappis obscene glee polly though ducked out of the door pulled a small tin mug out of her pack dipped it into a water butt balanced it on an old barrel behind the inn and started to shave shed practiced this too the secret was in the old cutthroat razor that shed carefully blunted after that it was all in the shaving brush and soap get a lot of lather on shave a lot of lather off and youd had a shave hadnt you must have done sir feel how smooth the skin is she was halfway through when a voice by her ear screamed quotwhat dyou think youre doing private partsquot it was just as well the blade was blunt quotperks sirquot she said rubbing her nose quotim shaving sir its perks sirquot quotsir sir im not a sir parts im a bloody corporal parts that means you calls me corporal parts and you are shaving in an official regimental mug parts what you have not been issued with right you a deserter partsquot quotno s corporalquot quota thief thenquot quotno corporalquot quotthen how come you got a bloody mug partsquot quotgot it off a dead man sir corporalquot strappis voice pitched to a scream in any case became a screech of rage quotyoure a looter quot quotno corporal the soldier quot had died almost in her arms on the floor of the inn there had been half a dozen men in that party of returning heroes they must have been trekking with grayfaced patience for days making their way back to little villages in the mountains polly counted nine arms and ten legs between them and ten eyes but it was the apparently whole who were worse in a way they kept their stinking coats buttoned tight in lieu of bandages over whatever unspeakable mess lay beneath and they had the smell of death about them the inns regulars made space for them and talked quietly like people in a sacred place her father not usually a man given to sentiment quietly put a generous tot of brandy into each mug of ale and refused all payment then it turned out that they were carrying letters from soldiers still fighting and one of them had brought the letter from paul he pushed it across the table to polly as she served them stew and then with very little fuss he died the rest of the men moved unsteadily on later that day taking with them to give to his parents the potmetal medal that had been in the mans coat pocket and the official commendation from the duchy that went with it polly had taken a look at it it was printed including the duchesss signature and the mans name had been filled in rather cramped because it was longer than average the last few letters were rammed up tight together its little details like that which get remembered as undirected whitehot rage fills the mind apart from the letter and the medal all the man left behind was a tin mug and on the floor a stain which wouldnt scrub out
