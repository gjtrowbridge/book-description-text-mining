stars glittered across the night sky and the moon spilled light illuminating the trees belowturning leaves a glistening silver a female owl skimmed the canopy dipped lower to speed through the labyrinth of trees before rising again just in time to avoid a thick branch a second larger owl chased her in a wide circle above the forest surrounding a clearing where a large two story stone house sat the female plummeted toward the steep roof talons extended toward the chimney pulled up at the last heartstopping second to race away from the male wings flapping noiselessly the wind riffling iridescent feathers raven mikhail dubrinsky warned his lifemate sharply that was far too close it was exhilarating raven you are going to get tired there was a soft warning growl in mikhails voice as if a wolf lurked inside the body of the owl her laughter bubbled up soft and warm in his mind as they telepathically communicated im not a newbie anymore mikhail and after all these years i think i can handle flying i love it its my favorite thing to do are you ever going to get over being overprotective i do not think it is overprotective to watch over the woman of my heart and soul you always over do it when you fly and you risk much more than you should that may have been true but raven wasnt going to admit it once in the body of a bird she wanted to stay that way for long periods of time i feel so free from the moment of her conversionhuman to carpathianthe one thing that had intrigued and filled her with joy above all else in her new life was the ability to fly she could soar high above earth and see miles of beautiful forest cool lakes and a riot of wildflowers beauty always surrounded her when she took the form of an owl making her forgetat least for a few moments the absolute wonderand responsibilityof being lifemate to the prince of the carpathian people there was a small silence raven do you not feel freedom when you are with me i have never caged you although at times i felt it would be the safest thing to do the female owl circled back toward the male to position herself just under his left wing of course not silly dont you love flying the wind lifting your body while terrain below appears so magical there was that whisper of love in her voicein her mind mikhail had come to depend on the steadinessthe absolute steadfastness of her love it is so if you ever are despairing of my nature i would want you to let me know i feel your sadness sometimes my love the ache in your heart dont mikhail not because of you or because of us like any woman who has found her true lifemate i want children i cant complain we have our daughter savannah so precious to both of us and much more than many other of our women are gifted with if we have never have another i have been lucky enough to have one child as well as the only man who could ever make me happy you and savannah are enough for me mikhail wished they were home where he could pull her into his arms and kiss her soundly he ached with love for her more than he cared to admit and he could hearand feelthe desire in her to hold a child in her arms it was his greatest failurenot only to his lifemate but his people after hundreds of years he still couldnt protect his people from their greatest threatnot vampires or magenot modern societynot even their own lack of emotion after two hundred years and the ever present darkness creeping into their souls he couldnt protect them from what he was beginning to believe might be the very extinction of their species mikhail raven whispered his name in his mind a soft sound of utter love and compassion you will find the answers for our people youve accomplished so much already by bringing such great minds together in an effort to solve this problem and three babies have survived in the last few years we kept savannah francesca and gabriel have tamara and now there is corrine and dayans child jennifer three girls my love there is yet hope mikhail was silent wanting to roar his despair to the heavens three female children when so many of the men of his species were without hope to survive to maintain honor they had no choice but to find the one woman who would complete their soullight to their darkness without a woman they had nothing but an endless barren existence thats not so raven denied many have found their lifemates among my people a handful raven why cant i find the answer when i have such great minds working on the problem we need women and children or our kind will cease to exist after the assassination attempt on his life more than anything else mikhail feared their enemies would realize just how fragile the carpathian race had become with so many against them it would only take one to realize where the true vulnerability of the carpathian race laythe absence of women and children so far all the strikes had been directed against the men but sooner or later their enemies would realize that to kill the species they had only to kill the women and children the thought of raven his beloved lifemate or his precious daughter savannah as a target was almost more than he could bearbut it was inevitable the enemy had joined together with the dark mage and had found a way to hide his presence making him doubly dangerous no longer could the carpathians rely on their ability to read minds and sense a threat they must be more vigilant than ever even now he scanned the forest below them warily unable to relax completely mikhail you have closed your mind to mine he forced his thoughts back to their conversation it was bad enough that he could not console his lifemate over losing a child let alone stay on track with such an important topicyou have lived with us only fifty years and already you have suffered the loss of a child can you imagine the great sorrow in a hundred yearstwo hundred our women cannot suffer these losses without severe repercussions shea believes she and gary are much closer to finding the answers gabrielle is now helping as well raven reminded gary was human and gabrielle had been recently to save her life gabrielle had undergone the conversion but she had worked tirelessly even before the change to aid shea in finding out why carpathian women suffered so many miscarriages with all the training shea has as a human doctor and her natural abilities as a carpathian healer she is an amazing resource to our people she has worked with gabrielle gary and of course gregori to find the answer as to why our women can no longer successfully carry children the few babies born rarely survived the first year raven was grateful she had had a miscarriage and was spared the terrible grief of giving birth holding her child for a year and then losing it shea has already discovered so much she will unlock this mystery mikhail believed shea might be the one to perform such a miracle she had already proved her tenacity and courage in bringing his brother jacques back from the brink of insanity but mikhail also feared the answers would come too late for his people their enemies were banding together closing in and striking often worse it seemed their oldest and cruelest enemy might still be alive xavier the dark mage and his grandson razvan were aiding the undead with ancient knowledge raven broke away from him to fly with her usual abandon far too close to the canopy of trees his heart nearly stopped and it took tremendous discipline to keep from ordering her back to his side where she would be safe he couldnt imprison her any more than any of the other carpathian males could their lifemates but the need and desire were there beating at him with ruthless temptation mikhail put on a burst of speed catching up to the woman who completed his soul his sharp eyes scanning the terrain below as they flew together he could feel happiness radiating from her and it helped to ease the burdens in his heart you do know my love raven called teasinglythat you have to play santa claus at the christmas party for all the children mikhail lost the imagethat of an owlin his mind for first time in hundreds of years his body plummeted thirty feet nearly hitting the top of a tree before he recovered from his shock even within the owls body he shuddered you may rid yourself of that notion at once raven spiraled down toward their home her body graceful in flight landing on two feet on the walkway leading to their porch as she shifted into her natural form mikhail followed her shifting as he landed directly in front of her halting her escape the lines and planes of his face hardened into a fierce look meant to intimidate this conversation is not over he couldnt prevent the small shudder running through his body there are things you should never ask a man to do raven merely rolled her eyes the children will be expecting st nick to make an appearance this is our first big christmas party the first real one and the women have agreed to cook so the men have to do their part you have to do it mikhail i do not think so he replied his expression could daunt the most dangerous of vampires or vampire hunters but certainly did not seem to have the desired effect on his lifemate raven merely huffed out her breath at him exasperated dont be such a baby human men do it all the time with absolutely no fear i am not afraid her eyebrow shot up the one that always intrigued him but this time she looked suspiciously as if she might be laughing at him oh yes you are you look terrifiedand pale im pale because ive expended energy flying without first taking sustenance i am the prince of the carpathian people not santa claus thats not an excuse as the leader of our people it is your duty to play the part of st nick its tradition not carpathian tradition it is not dignified raven mikhail swept his black hair to the nape of his neck and secured it with a thin strip of leather his black eyes glittered at her making every attempt to intimidate her into submission she burst out laughing completely unsympathetic and certainly not scared tough luck hotshot its your job carpathian tradition or not you promised me wed have a big christmas party for everyone our people have come from the united states south america and several other countries to participate in our celebration we cannot possibly disappoint them it will not be disappointing to anyone if i do not do this ridiculous thing her laughter deepened into a rich appealing sound that played down his spine and made his stomach do a funny little flip only raven could do that to him only raven could make him want to do anything on earth to please her trust me mikhail the entire carpathian race will be disappointed if they do not see you playing the role of santa claus she stroked his face with her fingertips a nice white beard her hand ran down his chest to his hard flat stomach a nice round belly you arent at all amusing but she was and it was taking everything he had not to smile at her you promised me you would do everything to make our first christmas gathering a success i was not thinking at the time you were distracting me he grumbled was i raven asked blinking innocently i cant remember mikhail wrapped his arms around raven and pulled her into his body nibbling on her neck he tasted her pulse felt her answering excitement and knew it would always be this way between them raven he thought he couldnt love her more yet each day the emotion grew stronger until he felt he was bursting with it sometimes when she wasnt looking he could feel blood red tears welling up in his eyes who would believe the powerful prince of the carpathian people would be so enamored of a woman he had been born with the ritual words of binding imprinted on his brain as had every other male of his kind it had been a shock to discover not only that a human woman could become his lifemate but that she could be successfully turned to his species more than the complete amazement of all of that was the overwhelming love and hunger and he felt for her that it grew stronger with every moment they shared together looking at her could steal the breath from his body you always smell so good raven reached back to circle his neck with her arm dragging his head closer so she could kiss him the moment his lips touched hers fire exploded in his gut and spread low racing through his system until his blood thickened and his pulse pounded he pressed his body closer so she could feel the evidence of his desire she laughed softly you always make me forget what im doing im supposed to be cooking the turkey its been a very long time and i have to make certain i dont make any mistakes weve invited the ostojics and the guests staying at the inn we need human food and since it was my idea i couldnt very well pass on the most important item on our dinner menu yes you could mikhails voice suddenly turned sly raven whirled around to study her lifemates all too innocent expression what are you up to mikhail im passing on the duty of being jolly old st nick raven put both hands on her hips and tilted her head narrowing her eyes youre up to something very very bad i can feel your laughter what is so amusing it has just occurred to me that i have a soninlaw a slow answering grin spread over ravens face even as she gasped in shock one hand flying to her throat you wouldnt not gregori hell scare all the children he couldnt look jolly if he tried we let him take our daughter from us mikhail said i think as his fatherinlaw he will have a hard time turning me down and you say i have a wicked sense of humor raven accused where do you think i got it mikhail nuzzled her neck his voice a husky whisper the familiar answering tingle of excitement shot down her spine raven loved the way mikhails every touch seemed so intimate hell never do it not in a million years and youll still have to but id love to see his face when you ask i have no intention of asking mikhail denied straightening to his full height im his prince as well as his fatherinlaw and he is my second in command and soninlaw it is his duty to do these things you cant order him to play santa claus raven tried desperately to keep her laughter from spilling over gregori was one of the most intimidating men shed ever met the idea of even considering him in the part of santa claus was both hilarious and ludicrous to her i believe that i can raven mikhail said solemnly you ordered me and im the prince raven made a snickering sound i suppose youd prefer i groveled at your feet his hands framed her face and he bent to take possession of her mouth he loved her mouthher tasteher instant response i could kiss you for all time good thing since you dragged me kicking and screaming into your world raven closed her eyes and gave herself up to the sheer magic of his kiss her arms stole around his neck and she leaned into him wanting to feel the imprint of his body so real and alive against hers there had been too many assassination attempts on mikhail just recently they had lost one of their homes in a fierce battle fighting the combined forces of razvan a mage and vampires it had been unheard of for vampires to ban together let alone with any other species it frightened her to think there was a conspiracy to murder mikhail her terror of losing him had partly been the reason shed suggested a huge celebration of christmas she needed something to take her mind off of her growing fears for his safety mikhail lifted his head retaining possession of her chin there is no need for you to fear for my safety raven the smile faded from ravens face and she took a step away from her lifemate there is every need she glanced toward the forest a hitch in her breath someone is coming a youngster raven no one to be afraid of mikhail brought her palm to his mouth to press a kiss in the center ive never seen you so nervous i try to accept what we cannot change mikhail but as the years have gone by the danger to you has increased i try to live as normal a life as possible but i cannot even now when it is imperative to protect you overcome my revulsion of sleeping in the ground my terror of being buried alive makes us more vulnerable than ever ashamed she ducked her head avoiding his eyes raven my love he bent his head once more to hers his lips brushing hers with a tenderness that brought tears to her eyes i made you a promise and i mean to keep it you do not ever have to sleep beneath the ground the earth rejuvenates us in our chamber and there is no need to feel you have in any way placed my life in danger you are my life i cannot allow you ever to be in danger if i thought sleeping in our chamber was dangerous i would find another way her eyes searched his her mind sweeping through his at the same time searching for the truth she knew he wove strong safeguards to protect them but she still feared she placed them in danger with her strong aversion to going to ground the rustle of leaves on the path to their home broke them apart mikhail shifting his body slightly to place his taller frame between the forest and his lifemate a young woman emerged from behind several leafy plants looking frightened but determined she was average height with tousled dark hair shimmering with red streaks she had the skin of a young girl and the eyes of someone far far older skyler mikhail identified for raven gabriel and francesca adopted her both gabriel and francesca have given her their blood she is still human yet carries a powerful bloodline she is a very strong psychic raven smiled at the teenager she worries about the carpathian males wanting to claim her now that she is sixteen shes much too young to worry about such things you must be skyler how nice of you to come visiting perhaps youd care to come in and talk to me while i check on the turkey i do not see gabriel with you mikhail greeted pointedly this young child represented hope to his race yet she walked through the forest unescorted mikhail dont frighten her there are wolves in the forest as well as the possibility of enemies skyler stopped abruptly her gaze shifting to mikhail for a moment her dark eyes clashed with mikhails black ones defiantly gabriel trusts me to make me way to your house im not a child anymore i can see that im mikhail and this is my lifemate raven gabriel and francesca speak of you so often i feel as if i know you forgive me if i showed my concern for a young woman i look upon as family a brief smile flitted with skylers mouth i have to hand it to you mr dubrinsky that should make me feel like a worm but it doesnt im here because i absolutely want to make it clear that i am not a lifemate to anyone a shadow passed across the moon briefly blotting out the light spilling down on the forest bats wheeled and dipped in a mad frenzied performance in the night sky mikhail stood still searching the surrounding forest with his preternatural senses he gestured imperiously toward the door raven held open they followed skyler inside you are so certain of this the aroma of turkey filled the house and mikhail hid his natural revulsion against the scent of meat cooking smells from her past often comforted raven she was unaware of it but he sensed her happiness as if the turkey in the oven had been an important part of her lifea good memory of childhoodso he was careful not to ruin it for her raven sent him a small smile as if she might be reading his thoughts in spite of his thin shield hed have to watch that her skills and powers grew daily skyler looked at the high beamed ceilings and wide open space before her gaze settled on the three enormous stained glass windows her face lit up and she walked straight over to them this is francescas work isnt she awesome i helped her with this one she tilted her head to study the vibrant colors i havent learned how to weave the safeguards into the glass yet i can do it in quilts but glass is much more complicated she glanced at raven do you ever stand under the setting sun and feel comfort skyler moved an inch to her left right here if you stand right in this spot as the last rays of light hit youll feel it i did that its a work of art raven said if i could id have every window done in francescas work i had no idea you were helping her i have some talent not nearly as strong as hers but shes helping me develop mine i hope to be partners with her one day the smile faded leaving her eyes bleak she reached up to brush strands of dark hair from her face revealing a small crescentshaped scar on her temple and drawing attention to the white scars on her hands and forearms skyler seemed to be aware of her nervous gesture and folded her hands her chin raising a fraction ive heard rumors of a coming out partywhere the men gather to see if they could possibly be compatible with one of the women we have no women mikhail pointed out there are no parties and no coming out as we have no women skylers mouth firmed into a stubborn line as she followed the couple into the kitchen gabriel and francesca treat me like family mikhail nodded they love you as if you were their daughter he inhaled deeply drawing her scent into his lungs you carry their blood so through love blood and in every other way you are their daughter theyve offered to convert me when im twentyone and im considering it but i want assurances that you wont try to force me to be with a manany man no one would force you to do anything raven said gabriel is a powerful man dont you think he would protect you absolutely he would protect me i dont want gabriel or francesca to have to protect me if i go through the conversion i do not want someone trying to claim me are you not aware of the plight of our people of our males mikhail demanded raven put a restraining hand on his arm have a seat skyler can i get you something to eat or drink we have juice in the fridge without breaking eye contact with mikhail the teenager sank into a chair with an almost regal nod yes thank you juice would be nice she is terrific isnt she mikhail shes terrified but determined that she be heard there was admirationand warning in ravens soft message to her lifemate raven poured a glass of orange juice and set it in front of skyler mikhails head went up alertly and he stepped toward the window his gaze restless as he searched the darkness he felt the presence of wolves and owls as they hunted for prey but nothing that would cause the uneasy feeling twisting at his gut he glanced down at the defiant young teenager gently probing her mindand memories he found francesca and gabriels shields to help distance the girl from the brutality of her life before they had made her their ward but even with that protection in place the memories of the malicious cruelty and violence against skyler sickened him mikhail glanced at raven and saw the tears shimmering in her eyes as she shared skylers pastfelt her pain and despairthe utter hopelessness of a child who could not escape from a depraved adult world raven hastily crossed to the oven to check on the turkey it smells good skyler said i used a wild rice stuffing raven said i remember it from my childhood it took a bit of time tracking down the recipe but it should be good although its been a long time since i cooked anything francesca lets me cook whenever i want she trusts me to make my own decisions skyler glanced at mikhail are you aware of what happens to a carpathian male without his lifemate mikhail asked his voice and compelling skyler nodded gabriel and francesca both explained it to me they lose colors and emotions first over hundreds of years honor can fade and they become dangerous especially the hunters any who take lives and eventually they can become the vampire the most evil of all creatures and you would leave your lifemate to this fate you would be that cruel and inhumane should he suffer even more than he already is because you did mikhail raven whirled around shock on her face shes a child how could you giving our daughter to gregori before she was beyond a fledging was bad enough but this child has suffered and we have no way of knowing whether or not she is lifemate to one of our males she is mature far beyond her human years raven allow her to answer skyler carefully placed the glass on the table and stood up folding her arms as she faced mikhail squarely no of course not i wouldnt want anyone to suffer but i cant seem to overcome the things in my past she held her trembling hands in front of her i dont feel comfortable in the presence of men im not capable of being anyones lifemate and i dont want to be forced into a position where i have no choice no say in my life i didnt come to the conclusion lightly i love gabriel and i certainly wouldnt want to think of him dead or suffering or a vampire but i know i cant ever be powerless again male carpathians are far too dominating and i would find myself slipping back into that dark place where francesca first found me mikhail frowned do you believe our women are without power is that how you see francesca skyler shook her head francesca is loved and returns love she can do what i cantand never will be able to do gabriel promised meas did lucianthat they will never let another force my compliance but i know a carpathian male has the ability to bind a carpathian woman to him i want to be fully gabriel and francescas daughter but i dont want to be subject to the laws of your world she doesnt know her lifemate could bind her to him in her human state mikhail reached out to raven suddenly at a loss as to what to do or say to this womanchild why would francesca and gabriel and even lucian keep this information from her skyler he said aloud a carpathian male must put his lifemate above all else he would see to your needs have patience with you you are young yet you have no idea how youll feel in a few years i do know and you would sentence a carpathian male one who has given many lifetimes of service to deathor worseto the undead out of fear his decisions have nothing to do with me and what of the carpathian race our species is nearly extinct we cannot continue to exist without women and children one woman makes a difference one woman can save a male and give birth to a child i see francesca struggling sometimes to be true to her nature and shes a strong woman gabriel is very protective and dislikes her going anywhere without him mikhail slammed a barrier in his mind immediately to prevent raven from reading his mind gabriel had to be concerned with their enemies striking at the women yet he had allowed skyler to go into the woods or had he did you mention to gabriel that you were coming to see us skyler scuffed the toe of her hiking boot on the kitchen floor i may have forgotten he was busy helping francesca bake gingerbread for the house were making for the children raven basted the turkey in silence turning over skylers fears in her mind what is it francesca struggles against skyler she asked skyler shrugged what do you struggle against mikhail was slightly shocked at the human teenagers reply she sounded far too mature for her age and that in itself was a danger he hadnt considered if gabriel and francesca had thought about the potential risks before bringing skyler to their homeland they would have mentioned her maturity to him she was only sixteena virtual baby by their standards yet her experiences had aged her far beyond her physical years she lookedand spokeas an adult would her voice trigger the terrible needs of the carpathian male if so and she restored color and emotion to her lifemate before she could meet his needs that might be as dangerous to the male when she wasnt ready to be with him as not finding her at all often being a lifemateand intense sexual awareness and needcame before love or even affection raven touched his handa small gesture but it was enough to lighten his spirits she smiled at the teenager i struggle with the terrible burden of so many lives depending on my lifemate and with the knowledge that so many want him dead and i struggle with my own inadequacies there are still aspects of carpathian life i cant come to terms with and it could present an added danger to my lifemate she smiled up at mikhail the stark love shining in her eyes put an unexpected lump in his throat i have never not once not at any time regretted that i am lifemate to this man i think you underestimate your own abilities skyler youre a very courageous young woman you are far too young to contemplate taking on a carpathian male but eventually you will come into your full power and potential most of the men have no idea what theyve gotten themselves into she winked at the girl it takes time to develop skills and power and most of us were too young but we learn quickly by utilizing the mind bond skyler nodded gabriel and francesca teach me by sharing information telepathically and ive found its so much more detailed than conversation i can see how youd learn so much more quickly hows the baby doing there was a hitch in ravens voice and she didnt dare glance at mikhail of course he would noticehe always noticed his gaze found herssharpaware sliding over her body with too much knowledge she hadnt told him she could get pregnantthat is was the optimum time and if they let this chance slip by it could be years before it happened again ashamed of being afraid of the sorrow and grief that accompanied taking such a chance raven looked away from him and sometimes skyler i struggle against my own weaknesses and fears but neverneveragainst being lifemate to mikhail skyler obviously an empath moved closer to raven as if by her close presence she could reduce the sadness i guess we all do that dont we she looked to mikhail for confirmation mikhail touched ravens hair his fingers gentle raven my love his voice in her mind was infinitely tenderevery carpathian male knows when his mate can conceive you are everything i have ever wanted when you are readyonly when you are readydo we try again he smiled at skyler even as his gaze caressed his lifemate you are a very wise young lady dark clouds crossed the moon momentarily darkening the skies and casting macabre shadows into the large kitchen the silhouette of a large wolf passed in front of the window as if a large creature had crept onto the wraparound deck and paced just outside instinctively they turned toward the second window just over the sink skyler gave a muffled cry as a great shaggy head fur black and eyes glowing nearly red stared at them through the glass stay inside mikhail commanded as he shimmeredfirst into transparencyand then dissolved into vapor streaming across the kitchen to slide under the door out into the night the wolf abruptly disappeared leaving the two women staring into the darkness it could have been gabriel or lucian checking up on me skyler ventured they often take the form of a wolf raven shook her head they would have come to the house talked with mikhail let you know they were worried skyler put a comforting hand on her arm a difficult thing for her to do when she disliked being touched or touching there are a dozen carpathian males within hearing distance if the prince needs help he has only to call out raven smiled at her one hand to her throat of course he can whatever is out there doesnt really feel like a threat to me in the form of an animal it would be easy enough for a skilled carpathianor vampireto hide his intentions but raven wasnt going to acknowledge that to skyler mikhail will let us know if something is wrong in the meantime i have this turkey in the oven have you ever cooked before its been such a long time for me and i could use a hand skyler laughed we have a housekeeper she does the cooking and lets me into the kitchen once in a while but doesnt really like anyone under foot she pretends it doesnt bother her but i know it does of course youd know youre an empath you can feel what shes feeling that must be uncomfortable for you skyler shrugged gabriel and francesca are helping me to learn how to shut myself off so far i havent mastered it yet but i think eventually ill be fairly good at it francesca helps to guard me during the time shes awake why do you want them to convert you theyre my family i want to be with them and theyve both exchanged blood with you skyler nodded it will only take one blood exchange for the conversion gabriel explained it to me but he wants me to wait until im older he thinks i need more time to think about it but i know what i want as long as the prince doesnt insist on me taking a carpathian male as a lifemate then im going to try to get gabriel to do it as soon as possible its difficult on your body skyler raven warned theres a great deal of pain they cant protect you from i can feel that youre uneasy raven theres something you arent telling me raven had been completely human just as skyler had been and she was a strong psychic talent she could feel that carpathian blood had already heightened skylers awareness and senses the girl was sharp and had powerful with welldeveloped psychic talents raven still remembered those days the sensation of someone elses emotions creeping over her sharp and terrible there was a scent to evil and depravity and an empath as sensitive as skyler needed to be sheltered from the continual assault on her it was no wonder gabriel and francesca had both given her blood to help shield her i think you already know what im not telling you skyler you came here not to ask mikhail for assurances but to make him aware of your strong objections francesca and gabriel would never try to hide the truth from youthat your true lifemate can bind you to him whether you are human or carpathian if you are the other half of his soul he can seal you together you know that dont you skyler blushed as she nodded her head im sorry i shouldnt have lied sometimes i learn more by pretending ignorance most people dont give a teenager credit for intelligence or maturity i can ask for protection against him cant i raven studied the tooold eyes have you met your lifemate skyler shook her head her gaze shifting away i have nightmares i hear a voice sometimes and im afraid she hesitated when i was a little girl and men did things to me i would scream and scream in my mind i would hear a voice calling to me at the time i just thought i was going crazy but i know hes out there somewhere and hes looking for me she rubbed the spot between her eyes i didnt want to come to the carpathian mountains because i was afraid he might be here but gabriel and francesca wouldnt leave me behind gabriel said i needed protection at all times ravens heart jumped he said that skyler nodded hes been strange lately not wanting francesca or me to go anywhere without him i can see she gets upset but she doesnt say anything she works at the hospital and some of the shelters and i often go with her but he doesnt like her going anymore raven busied herself with the turkey basting it again even though there was no need when did gabriel start becoming upset about the two of you going off alone she kept her voice casual but out of the corner of her eye caught the girls sharp glance since the attack on the prince there is nothing to fear out here raven one of the males taking a run in the forest and decided to drop by but saw we had company i am going to see my brother do not allow skyler back into the forest without an escort should i be worried about something mikhail raven felt the brief hesitation i do not know i am uneasy but have no real reason to be be careful mikhail be safe tell shea ill see her soon what are you discussing with jacques raven felt his sudden amusement the image of gregori dressed up as santa claus surrounded by children
