 chapter 1 in 1972 i was sixteen8212young my father said to be traveling with him on his diplomatic missions he preferred to know that i was sitting attentively in class at the international school of amsterdam in those days his foundation was based in amsterdam and it had been my home for so long that i had nearly forgotten our early life in the united states it seems peculiar to me now that i should have been so obedient well into my teens while the rest of my generation was experimenting with drugs and protesting the imperialist war in vietnam but i had been raised in a world so sheltered that it makes my adult life in academia look positively adventurous to begin with i was motherless and the care that my father took of me had been deepened by a double sense of responsibility so that he protected me more completely than he might have otherwise my mother had died when i was a baby before my father founded the center for peace and democracy my father never spoke of her and turned quietly away if i asked questions i understood very young that this was a topic too painful for him to discuss instead he took excellent care of me himself and provided me with a series of governesses and housekeepers8212money was not an object with him where my upbringing was concerned although we lived simply enough from day to day the latest of these housekeepers was mrs clay who took care of our narrow seventeenthcentury town house on the raamgracht a canal in the heart of the old city mrs clay let me in after school every day and was a surrogate parent when my father traveled which was often she was english older than my mother would have been skilled with a feather duster and clumsy with teenagers sometimes looking at her toocompassionate longtoothed face over the dining table i felt she must be thinking of my mother and i hated her for it when my father was away the handsome house echoed no one could help me with my algebra no one admired my new coat or told me to come here and give him a hug or expressed shock over how tall i had grown when my father returned from some name on the european map that hung on the wall in our dining room he smelled like other times and places spicy and tired we took our vacations in paris or rome diligently studying the landmarks my father thought i should see but i longed for those other places he disappeared to those strange old places i had never been while he was gone i went back and forth to school dropping my books on the polished hall table with a bang neither mrs clay nor my father let me go out in the evenings except to the occasional carefully approved movie with carefully approved friends and8212to my retrospective astonishment8212i never flouted these rules i preferred solitude anyway it was the medium in which i had been raised in which i swam comfortably i excelled at my studies but not in my social life girls my age terrified me especially the toughtalking chainsmoking sophisticates of our diplomatic circle8212around them i always felt that my dress was too long or too short or that i should have been wearing something else entirely boys mystified me although i dreamed vaguely of men in fact i was happiest alone in my father8217s library a large fine room on the first floor of our house my father8217s library had probably once been a sitting room but he sat down only to read and he considered a large library more important than a large living room he had long since given me free run of his collection during his absences i spent hours doing my homework at the mahogany desk or browsing the shelves that lined every wall i understood later that my father had either half forgotten what was on one of the top shelves or8212more likely8212assumed i would never be able to reach it late one night i took down not only a translation of the kama sutra but also a much older volume and an envelope of yellowing papers i can8217t say even now what made me pull them down but the image i saw at the center of the book the smell of age that rose from it and my discovery that the papers were personal letters all caught my attention forcibly i knew i shouldn8217t examine my father8217s private papers or anyone8217s and i was also afraid that mrs clay might suddenly come in to dust the dustless desk8212that must have been what made me look over my shoulder at the door but i couldn8217t help reading the first paragraph of the topmost letter holding it for a couple of minutes as i stood near the shelves december 12 1930 trinity college oxford my dear and unfortunate successor it is with regret that i imagine you whoever you are reading the account i must put down here the regret is partly for myself8212because i will surely be at least in trouble maybe dead or perhaps worse if this is in your hands but my regret is also for you my yetunknown friend because only by someone who needs such vile information will this letter someday be read if you are not my successor in some other sense you will soon be my heir8212and i feel sorrow at bequeathing to another human being my own perhaps unbelievable experience of evil why i myself inherited it i don8217t know but i hope to discover that fact eventually8212perhaps in the course of writing to you or perhaps in the course of further events at this point my sense of guilt8212and something else too8212made me put the letter hastily back in its envelope but i thought about it all that day and all the next when my father returned from his latest trip i looked for an opportunity to ask him about the letters and the strange book i waited for him to be free for us to be alone but he was very busy in those days and something about what i had found made me hesitate to approach him finally i asked him to take me on his next trip it was the first time i had kept a secret from him and the first time i had ever insisted on anything reluctantly my father agreed he talked with my teachers and with mrs clay and reminded me that there would be ample time for my homework while he was in meetings i wasn8217t surprised for a diplomat8217s child there was always waiting to be done i packed my navy suitcase taking my schoolbooks and too many pairs of clean kneesocks instead of leaving the house for school that morning i departed with my father walking silently and gladly beside him toward the station a train carried us to vienna my father hated planes which he said took the travel out of traveling there we spent one short night in a hotel another train took us through the alps past all the whiteandblue heights of our map at home outside a dusty yellow station my father started up our rented car and i held my breath until we turned in at the gates of a city he had described to me so many times that i could already see it in my dreams autumn comes early to the foot of the slovenian alps even before september the abundant harvests are followed by a sudden poignant rain that lasts for days and brings down leaves in the lanes of the villages now in my fifties i find myself wandering that direction every few years reliving my first glimpse of the slovenian countryside this is old country every autumn mellows it a little more in aeternum each beginning with the same three colors a green landscape two or three yellow leaves falling through a gray afternoon i suppose the romans8212who left their walls here and their gargantuan arenas to the west on the coast8212saw the same autumn and gave the same shiver when my father8217s car swung through the gates of the oldest of julian cities i hugged myself for the first time i had been struck by the excitement of the traveler who looks history in her subtle face b ecause this city is where my story starts i8217ll call it emona its roman name to shield it a little from the sort of tourist who follows doom around with a guidebook emona was built on bronze age pilings along a river now lined with artnouveau architecture during the next day or two we would walk past the mayor8217s mansion past seventeenthcentury town houses trimmed with silver fleursdelis past the solid golden back of a great market building its steps leading down to the surface of the water from heavily barred old doors for centuries river cargo had been hoisted up at that place to feed the town and where primitive huts had once proliferated on the shore sycamores8212the european plane tree8212now grew to an immense girth above the river walls and dropped curls of bark into the current near the market the city8217s main square spread out under the heavy sky emona like her sisters to the south showed flourishes of a chameleon past viennese deco along the skyline great red churches from the renaissance of its slavicspeaking catholics hunched brown medieval chapels with the british isles in their features saint patrick sent missionaries to this region bringing the new creed full circle back to its mediterranean origins so that the city claims one of the oldest christian histories in europe here and there an ottoman element flared in doorways or in a pointed window frame next to the market grounds one little austrian church sounded its bells for the evening mass men and women in blue cotton work coats were moving toward home at the end of the socialist workday holding umbrellas over their packages as my father and i drove into the heart of emona we crossed the river on a fine old bridge guarded at each end by greenskinned bronze dragons 8220there8217s the castle8221 my father said slowing at the edge of the square and pointing up through a wash of rain 8220i know you8217ll want to see that8221 i did want to i stretched and craned until i caught sight of the castle through sodden tree branches8212motheaten brown towers on a steep hill at the town8217s center 8220fourteenth century8221 my father mused 8220or thirteenth i8217m not good with these medieval ruins not down to the exact century but we8217ll look in the guidebook8221 8220can we walk up there and explore it8221 8220we can find out about it after my meetings tomorrow those towers don8217t look as if they8217d hold a bird up safely but you never know8221 he pulled the car into a parking space near the town hall and helped me out of the passenger side gallantly his hand bony in its leather glove 8220it8217s a little early to check in at the hotel would you like some hot tea or we could get a snack at that gastronomia it8217s raining harder8221 he added doubtfully looking at my wool jacket and skirt i quickly got out the hooded waterproof cape he8217d brought me from england the year before the train trip from vienna had taken nearly a day and i was hungry again in spite of our lunch in the dining car but it was not the gastronomia with its red and blue interior lights gleaming through one dingy window its waitresses in their navy platform sandals8212doubtless8212and its sullen picture of comrade tito that snared us as we picked our way through the wet crowd my father suddenly darted forward 8220here8221 i followed at a run my hood flapping almost blinding me he had found the entrance to an artnouveau teahouse a great scrolled window with storks wading across it bronze doors in the form of a hundred waterlily stems the doors closed heavily behind us and the rain faded to a mist mere steam on the windows seen through those silver birds as a blur of water 8220amazing this survived the last thirty years8221 my father was peeling off his london fog 8220socialism8217s not always so kind to its treasures8221 at a table near the window we drank tea with lemon scalding through the thick cups and ate our way through sardines on buttered white bread and even a few slices of torta 8220we8217d better stop there8221 my father said i had lately come to dislike the way he blew on his tea over and over to cool it and to dread the inevitable moment when he said we should stop eating stop doing whatever was enjoyable save room for dinner looking at him in his neat tweed jacket and turtleneck i felt he had denied himself every adventure in life except diplomacy which consumed him he would have been happier living a little i thought with him everything was so serious but i was silent because i knew he hated my criticism and i had something to ask i had to let him finish his tea first so i leaned back in my chair just far enough so that my father couldn8217t tell me to please not slump through the silvermottled window i could see a wet city gloomy in the deepening afternoon and people passing in a rush through horizontal rain the teahouse which should have been filled with ladies in long straight gowns of ivory gauze or gentlemen in pointed beards and velvet coat collars was empty 8220i hadn8217t realized how much the driving had worn me out8221 my father set his cup down and pointed to the castle just visible through the rain 8220that8217s the direction we came from the other side of that hill we8217ll be able to see the alps from the top8221 i remembered the whiteshouldered mountains and felt they breathed over this town we were alone together on their far side now i hesitated took a breath 8220would you tell me a story8221 stories were one of the comforts my father had always offered his motherless child some of them he drew from his own pleasant childhood in boston and some from his more exotic travels some he invented for me on the spot but i8217d recently grown tired of those finding them less astonishing than i8217d once thought 8220a story about the alps8221 8220no8221 i felt an inexplicable surge of fear 8220i found something i wanted to ask you about8221 he turned and looked mildly at me graying eyebrows raised above his gray eyes 8220it was in your library8221 i said 8220i8217m sorry8212i was poking around and i found some papers and a book i didn8217t look8212much8212at the papers i thought 82128221 8220a book8221 still he was mild checking his cup for a last drop of tea only half listening 8220they looked8212the book was very old with a dragon printed in the middle8221 he sat forward sat very still then shivered visibly this strange gesture alerted me at once if a story came it wouldn8217t be like any story he8217d ever told me he glanced at me under his eyebrows and i was surprised to see how drawn and sad he looked 8220are you angry8221 i was looking into my cup now too 8220no darling8221 he sighed deeply a sound almost grief stricken the small blond waitress refilled our cups and left us alone again and still he had a hard time getting started
