 the thing is my lucks always been rotten just look at my name jean not jean marie or jeanine or jeanette or even jeanne just jean did you know in france they name boys jean its french for john and okay i dont live in france but still im basically a girl named john if i lived in france anyway this is the kind of luck i have the kind of luck ive had since before mom even filled out my birth certificate so it wasnt any big surprise to me when the cab driver didnt help me with my suitcase id already had to endure arriving at the airport to find no one there to greet me and then got no answer to my many phone calls asking where my aunt and uncle were did they not want me after all had they changed their minds had they heard about my bad luck8212all the way from iowa8212and decided they didnt want any of it to rub off on them but even if that were true8212and as id told myself a million times since arriving at baggage claim where they were supposed to have met me and seeing no one but skycaps and limo drivers with little signs with everyones names on them but mine8212there was nothing i could do about it i certainly couldnt go home it was new york city8212and aunt evelyn and uncle teds house8212or bust so when the cab driver instead of getting out and helping me with my bags just pushed a little button so that the trunk popped open a few inches it wasnt the worst thing that had ever happened to me it wasnt even the worst thing that had happened to me that day i pulled out my bags each of which had to weigh fifty thousand pounds at least8212except my violin case of course8212and then closed the trunk again all while standing in the middle of east sixtyninth street with a line of cars behind me honking impatiently because they couldnt pass due to the fact that there was a stanley steemer van doubleparked across the street from my aunt and uncles building why me really id like to know the cab pulled away so fast i practically had to leap between two parked cars to keep from getting run over the honking stopped as the line of cars that had been waiting behind the cab started moving again their drivers all throwing me dirty looks as they went by it was all the dirty looks that did it8212made me realize i was really in new york city at last and yeah id seen the skyline from the cab as it crossed the triboro bridge the island of manhattan in all its gritty glory with the empire state building sticking up from the middle of it like a big glittery middle finger but the dirty looks were what really cinched it no one back in hancock would ever have been that mean to someone who was clearly from out of town not that all that many people visit hancock but whatever then there was the street i was standing on it was one of those streets that look exactly like the ones they always show on tv when theyre trying to let you know something is set in new york like on law and order you know the narrow three or fourstory brownstones with the brightly painted front doors and the stone stoops according to my mom most brownstones in new york city were originally singlefamily homes when they were built way back in the 1800s but now theyve been divided up into apartments so that theres one8212or sometimes even two or more families8212per floor not moms sister evelyns brownstone though aunt evelyn and uncle ted gardiner own all four floors of their brownstone thats practically one floor per person since aunt evelyn and uncle ted only have three kids my cousins tory teddy and alice back home we just have two floors but there are seven people living on them and only one bathroom not that im complaining still ever since my sister courtney discovered blowouts its been pretty grim at home but as tall as my aunt and uncles house was it was really narrow8212just three windows across still it was a very pretty townhouse painted gray with lighter gray trim the door was a bright cheerful yellow there were yellow flower boxes along the base of each window flower boxes from which bright red8212and obviously newly planted since it was only the middle of april and not quite warm enough for them8212geraniums spilled it was nice to know that even in a sophisticated city like new york people still realized how homey and welcoming a box of geraniums could be the sight of those geraniums cheered me up a little like maybe aunt evelyn and uncle ted just forgot i was arriving today and hadnt deliberately failed to meet me at the airport because theyd changed their minds about letting me come to stay like everything was going to be all right after all yeah with my luck probably not i started up the steps to the front door of 326 east sixtyninth street then realized i couldnt make it with both bags and my violin leaving one bag on the sidewalk i dragged the other up the steps with me my violin tucked under one arm i deposited the first suitcase and my violin case at the top of the steps then hurried back down for the second suitcase which id left on the sidewalk only i guess i took the steps a little too fast since i nearly tripped and fell flat on my face on the sidewalk i managed to catch myself at the last moment by grabbing some of the wroughtiron fencing the gardiners had put up
