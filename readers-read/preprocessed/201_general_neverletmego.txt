 my name is kathy h i8217m thirtyone years old and i8217ve been a carer now for over eleven years that sounds long enough i know but actually they want me to go on for another eight months until the end of this year that8217ll make it almost exactly twelve years now i know my being a carer so long isn8217t necessarily because they think i8217m fantastic at what i do there are some really good carers who8217ve been told to stop after just two or three years and i can think of one carer at least who went on for all of fourteen years despite being a complete waste of space so i8217m not trying to boast but then i do know for a fact they8217ve been pleased with my work and by and large i have too my donors have always tended to do much better than expected their recovery times have been impressive and hardly any of them have been classified as 8220agitated8221 even before fourth donation okay maybe i am boasting now but it means a lot to me being able to do my work well especially that bit about my donors staying 8220calm8221 i8217ve developed a kind of instinct around donors i know when to hang around and comfort them when to leave them to themselves when to listen to everything they have to say and when just to shrug and tell them to snap out of it anyway i8217m not making any big claims for myself i know carers working now who are just as good and don8217t get half the credit if you8217re one of them i can understand how you might get resentful8212about my bedsit my car above all the way i get to pick and choose who i look after and i8217m a hailsham student8212which is enough by itself sometimes to get people8217s backs up kathy h they say she gets to pick and choose and she always chooses her own kind people from hailsham or one of the other privileged estates no wonder she has a great record i8217ve heard it said enough so i8217m sure you8217ve heard it plenty more and maybe there8217s something in it but i8217m not the first to be allowed to pick and choose and i doubt if i8217ll be the last and anyway i8217ve done my share of looking after donors brought up in every kind of place by the time i finish remember i8217ll have done twelve years of this and it8217s only for the last six they8217ve let me choose and why shouldn8217t they carers aren8217t machines you try and do your best for every donor but in the end it wears you down you don8217t have unlimited patience and energy so when you get a chance to choose of course you choose your own kind that8217s natural there8217s no way i could have gone on for as long as i have if i8217d stopped feeling for my donors every step of the way and anyway if i8217d never started choosing how would i ever have got close again to ruth and tommy after all those years but these days of course there are fewer and fewer donors left who i remember and so in practice i haven8217t been choosing that much as i say the work gets a lot harder when you don8217t have that deeper link with the donor and though i8217ll miss being a carer it feels just about right to be finishing at last come the end of the year ruth incidentally was only the third or fourth donor i got to choose she already had a carer assigned to her at the time and i remember it taking a bit of nerve on my part but in the end i managed it and the instant i saw her again at that recovery centre in dover all our differences8212while they didn8217t exactly vanish8212seemed not nearly as important as all the other things like the fact that we8217d grown up together at hailsham the fact that we knew and remembered things no one else did it8217s ever since then i suppose i started seeking out for my donors people from the past and whenever i could people from hailsham there have been times over the years when i8217ve tried to leave hailsham behind when i8217ve told myself i shouldn8217t look back so much but then there came a point when i just stopped resisting it had to do with this particular donor i had once in my third year as a carer it was his reaction when i mentioned i was from hailsham he8217d just come through his third donation it hadn8217t gone well and he must have known he wasn8217t going to make it he could hardly breathe but he looked towards me and said 8220hailsham i bet that was a beautiful place8221 then the next morning when i was making conversation to keep his mind off it all and i asked where he8217d grown up he mentioned some place in dorset and his face beneath the blotches went into a completely new kind of grimace and i realised then how desperately he didn8217t want reminded instead he wanted to hear about hailsham so over the next five or six days i told him whatever he wanted to know and he8217d lie there all hooked up a gentle smile breaking through he8217d ask me about the big things and the little things about our guardians about how we each had our own collection chests under our beds the football the rounders the little path that took you all round the outside of the main house round all its nooks and crannies the duck pond the food the view from the art room over the fields on a foggy morning sometimes he8217d make me say things over and over things i8217d told him only the day before he8217d ask about like i8217d never told him 8220did you have a sports pavilion8221 8220which guardian was your special favourite8221 at first i thought this was just the drugs but then i realised his mind was clear enough what he wanted was not just to hear about hailsham but to remember hailsham just like it had been his own childhood he knew he was close to completing and so that8217s what he was doing getting me to describe things to him so they8217d really sink in so that maybe during those sleepless nights with the drugs and the pain and the exhaustion the line would blur between what were my memories and what were his that was when i first understood really understood just how lucky we8217d been8212tommy ruth me all the rest of us driving around the country now i still see things that will remind me of hailsham i might pass the corner of a misty field or see part of a large house in the distance as i come down the side of a valley even a particular arrangement of poplar trees up on a hillside and i8217ll think 8220maybe that8217s it i8217ve found it this actually is hailsham8221 then i see it8217s impossible and i go on driving my thoughts drifting on elsewhere in particular there are those pavilions i spot them all over the country standing on the far side of playing fields little white prefab buildings with a row of windows unnaturally high up tucked almost under the eaves i think they built a whole lot like that in the fifties and sixties which is probably when ours was put up if i drive past one i keep looking over to it for as long as possible and one day i8217ll crash the car like that but i keep doing it not long ago i was driving through an empty stretch of worcestershire and saw one beside a cricket ground so like ours at hailsham i actually turned the car and went back for a second look we loved our sports pavilion maybe because it reminded us of those sweet little cottages people always had in picture books when we were young i can remember us back in the juniors pleading with guardians to hold the next lesson in the pavilion instead of the usual room then by the time we were in senior 28212when we were twelve going on thirteen8212the pavilion had become the place to hide out with your best friends when you wanted to get away from the rest of hailsham the pavilion was big enough to take two separate groups without them bothering each other8212in the summer a third group could hang about out on the veranda but ideally you and your friends wanted the place just to yourselves so there was often jockeying and arguing the guardians were always telling us to be civilised about it but in practice you needed to have some strong personalities in your group to stand a chance of getting the pavilion during a break or free period i wasn8217t exactly the wilting type myself but i suppose it was really because of ruth we got in there as often as we did usually we just spread ourselves around the chairs and benches8212there8217d be five of us six if jenny b came along8212and had a good gossip there was a kind of conversation that could only happen when you were hidden away in the pavilion we might discuss something that was worrying us or we might end up screaming with laughter or in a furious row mostly it was a way to unwind for a while with your closest friends on the particular afternoon i8217m now thinking of we were standing up on stools and benches crowding around the high windows that gave us a clear view of the north playing field where about a dozen boys from our year and senior 3 had gathered to play football there was bright sunshine but it must have been raining earlier that day because i can remember how the sun was glinting on the muddy surface of the grass someone said we shouldn8217t be so obvious about watching but we hardly moved back at all then ruth said 8220he doesn8217t suspect a thing look at him he really doesn8217t suspect a thing8221 when she said this i looked at her and searched for signs of disapproval about what the boys were going to do to tommy but the next second ruth gave a little laugh and said 8220the idiot8221 and i realised that for ruth and the others whatever the boys chose to do was pretty remote from us whether we approved or not didn8217t come into it we were gathered around the windows at that moment not because we relished the prospect of seeing tommy get humiliated yet again but just because we8217d heard about this latest plot and were vaguely curious to watch it unfold in those days i don8217t think what the boys did amongst themselves went much deeper than that for ruth for the others it was that detached and the chances are that8217s how it was for me too or maybe i8217m remembering it wrong maybe even then when i saw tommy rushing about that field undisguised delight on his face to be accepted back in the fold again about to play the game at which he so excelled maybe i did feel a little stab of pain what i do remember is that i noticed tommy was wearing the light blue polo shirt he8217d got in the sales the previous month8212the one he was so proud of i remember thinking 8220he8217s really stupid playing football in that it8217ll get ruined then how8217s he going to feel8221 out loud i said to no one in particular 8220tommy8217s got his shirt on his favourite polo shirt8221 i don8217t think anyone heard me because they were all laughing at laura8212the big clown in our group8212mimicking one after the other the expressions that appeared on tommy8217s face as he ran waved called tackled the other boys were all moving around the field in that deliberately languorous way they have when they8217re warming up but tommy in his excitement seemed already to be going full pelt i said louder this time 8220he8217s going to be so sick if he ruins that shirt8221 this time ruth heard me but she must have thought i8217d meant it as some kind of joke because she laughed halfheartedly then made some quip of her own then the boys had stopped kicking the ball about and were standing in a pack in the mud their chests gently rising and falling as they waited for the team picking to start the two captains who emerged were from senior 3 though everyone knew tommy was a better player than any of that year they tossed for first pick then the one who8217d won stared at the group 8220look at him8221 someone behind me said 8220he8217s completely convinced he8217s going to be first pick just look at him8221 there was something comical about tommy at that moment something that made you think well yes if he8217s going to be that daft he deserves what8217s coming the other boys were all pre tending to ignore the picking process pretending they didn8217t care where they came in the order some were talking quietly to each other some retying their laces others just staring down at their feet as they trammelled the mud but tommy was looking eagerly at the senior 3 boy as though his name had already been called laura kept up her performance all through the teampicking doing all the different expressions that went across tommy8217s face the bright eager one at the start the puzzled concern when four picks had gone by and he still hadn8217t been chosen the hurt and panic as it began to dawn on him what was really going on i didn8217t keep glancing round at laura though because i was watching tommy i only knew what she was doing because the others kept laughing and egging her on then when tommy was left standing alone and the boys all began sniggering i heard ruth say 8220it8217s coming hold it seven seconds seven six five 8221 she never got there tommy burst into thunderous bellowing and the boys now laughing openly started to run off towards the south playing field tommy took a few strides after them8212it was hard to say whether his instinct was to give angry chase or if he was panicked at being left behind in any case he soon stopped and stood there glaring after them his face scarlet then he began to scream and shout a nonsensical jumble of swear words and insults we8217d all seen plenty of tommy8217s tantrums by then so we came down off our stools and spread ourselves around the room we tried to start up a conversation about something else but there was tommy going on and on in the background and although at first we just rolled our eyes and tried to ignore it in the end8212probably a full ten minutes after we8217d first moved away8212we were back up at the windows again the other boys were now completely out of view and tommy was no longer trying to direct his comments in any particular direction he was just raving flinging his limbs about at the sky at the wind at the nearest fence post laura said he was maybe 8220rehearsing his shakespeare8221 someone else pointed out how each time he screamed something he8217d raise one foot off the ground pointing it outwards 8220like a dog doing a pee8221 actually i8217d noticed the same foot movement myself but what had struck me was that each time he stamped the foot back down again flecks of mud flew up around his shins i thought again about his precious shirt but he was too far away for me to see if he8217d got much mud on it 8220i suppose it is a bit cruel8221 ruth said 8220the way they always work him up like that but it8217s his own fault if he learnt to keep his cool they8217d leave him alone8221 8220they8217d still keep on at him8221 hannah said 8220graham k8217s temper8217s just as bad but that only makes them all the more care ful with him the reason they go for tommy8217s because he8217s a layabout8221 then everyone was talking at once about how tommy never even tried to be creative about how he hadn8217t even put anything in for the spring exchange i suppose the truth was by that stage each of us was secretly wishing a guardian would come from the house and take him away and although we hadn8217t had any part in this latest plan to rile tommy we had taken out ringside seats and we were starting to feel guilty but there was no sign of a guardian so we just kept swapping reasons why tommy deserved everything he got then when ruth looked at her watch and said even though we still had time we should get back to the main house nobody argued tommy was still going strong as we came out of the pavilion the house was over to our left and since tommy was standing in the field straight ahead of us there was no need to go anywhere near him in any case he was facing the other way and didn8217t seem to register us at all all the same as my friends set off along the edge of the field i started to drift over towards him i knew this would puzzle the others but i kept going8212even when i heard ruth8217s urgent whisper to me to come back i suppose tommy wasn8217t used to being disturbed during his rages because his first response when i came up to him was to stare at me for a second then carry on as before it was like he was doing shakespeare and i8217d come up onto the stage in the middle of his performance even when i said 8220tommy your nice shirt you8217ll get it all messed up8221 there was no sign of him having heard me so i reached forward and put a hand on his arm afterwards the others thought he8217d meant to do it but i was pretty sure it was unintentional his arms were still flailing about and he wasn8217t to know i was about to put out my hand anyway as he threw up his arm he knocked my hand aside and hit the side of my face it didn8217t hurt at all but i let out a gasp and so did most of the girls behind me that8217s when at last tommy seemed to become aware of me of the others of himself of the fact that he was there in that field behaving the way he had been and stared at me a bit stupidly 8220tommy8221 i said quite sternly 8220there8217s mud all over your shirt8221 8220so what8221 he mumbled but even as he said this he looked down and noticed the brown specks and only just stopped himself crying out in alarm then i saw the surprise register on his face that i should know about his feelings for the polo shirt 8220it8217s nothing to worry about8221 i said before the silence got humiliating for him 8220it8217ll come off if you can8217t get it off yourself just take it to miss jody8221 he went on examining his shirt then said grumpily 8220it8217s nothing to do with you anyway8221 he seemed to regret immediately this last remark and looked at me sheepishly as though expecting me to say something comforting back to him but i8217d had enough of him by now particularly with the girls watching8212and for all i knew any number of others from the windows of the main house so i turned away with a shrug and rejoined my friends ruth put an arm around my shoulders as we walked away 8220at least you got him to pipe down8221 she said 8220are you okay mad animal8221
