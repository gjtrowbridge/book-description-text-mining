 earth date equivalent june 30th 1994 i tigron empire of the djinn ark imperial operating theater damn them prince djetthrojason eyed the masked males and the unpleasant array of implements they were preparing to use on him i havenrsquot told them everything and irsquom not about to no way am i going to invite anyone to take a laser to my privates ahhh fewmet the ldquobattlefield analgesiardquo was wearing off during the duel that hersquod begun as commander jason and ended mdashdefeatedmdash as prince djetthrojason hersquod felt almost no pain despite the damage tarrantarragon had inflicted now his massively bruised thigh throbbed heavily his neck muscles ached and his jawhellip it hurt even to think about his jaw perhaps worse mdashbut less so by the momentmdash was the damage to his alphamale machismo as he lay strapped down stark naked in his enemyrsquos operating theater preparing his mind for surgery without anesthetic also for ldquothe fate worse than deathrdquo which was to come if tarrantarragon had observed great djinn tradition the duel theyrsquod fought less than an hour ago ought to have been to the death why hadnrsquot tarrantarragon killed me then and there to the victor went the empire the ark imperial and godsright to any female he wantedhellip and we both want the same female damn it even if he wanted to stop i shouldrsquove fought on after hersquod crippled my leg and shattered my bloody jaw why didnrsquot i whatrsquos left for me what indeed irsquoll be the djinn equivalent of a broken thoroughbred stallion put out to stud itrsquos fairly obvious why tarrantarragon made an excuse not to finish me off the great djinn are nearly extinct in twenty yearsrsquo time tarrantarragonrsquos and djinniverarsquos children will need truedjinn mates all entitled to the silent d prefix to their royal djinn names thatrsquos why when the ldquofate worse than deathrdquo had been spelled out it had been sheer bravado to mumble that he wanted to marry princess martiadjulia maybe i do maybe i donrsquot it hurt how much he still wanted djinnivera whorsquod been the last djinn virgin in all the communicating worlds mdashand beyondmdash and betrothed to be his until tarrantarragon abducted her by force and took her virginity what consolation would it be to have tarrantarragonrsquos sexy fashionista bitch of a sister in his power and in his bed instead djetth winced at the savagery of his thoughts about martiadjulia shards of pain shot along his broken jawline hellrsquos teeth if he and martiadjulia were going to make a go of it shersquod have to have a shorter name maybe marsh or jewelhellip ldquowell djetthrojason are you ready to be carved up for your new identity and your new life as my little sisterrsquos glorified love slaverdquo from somewhere out of djetthrsquos line of sight tarrantarragon taunted him stressing the part of djetthrsquos real name that hersquod used until his cover as ldquocommander jasonrdquo was blown and he was overpowered and arrested djetth did not turn his head the pain in his face and head was intolerable enough without moving ldquoahhh i do believe that our imperial surgeons are ready to take out that distinctive jagged scar on your cheekrdquo tarrantarragon crooned ldquoand screw up your jawrdquo what else might they do while he was under the laser and the knife while his face was open might they carve out a sensory gland or two implant a tracking device use his broken jaw as an excuse to weld a mask over his head prince djetthrojason would be a latter day ldquoman in the iron maskrdquo if they realized how closely he resembled crown prince tarrantarragon which he would without his scars his colorful contact lenses and his long blonddyed hair djetth glanced at the treacherous turncoat rsquorhett whorsquod been his bloody useless ldquosecondrdquo at the duel and who was still hanging around what for damn him rsquorhett was way too much the intergalactic statesman for his own mdashor anyone elsesmdash good if the patient lost consciousness tarrantarragon could decide that the chances for galactic peace would be better if djetthrojason were neuteredhellip one way or another given the secrets rsquorhett knew rsquorhett might agree quotnomdashquot djetth groaned with the unexpected agony of trying to speak he wanted to refuse anesthetic again how he wished there was somebody present whom he could trust a door swished open ldquodoes he have to be in such painrdquo the cause of all the trouble spoke from the doorway she sounded on edge as if she felt his pain telepathically djinnivera no longer his djinni by conquest by the irrevocable exchange of vows and finally by her own choice she was tarrantarragonrsquos by all the lechers of antiquity how he loved her at that moment for coming mentally djetth qualified his thoughts djinnivera might not love him now but she was honorable to the core tarrantarragon wouldnrsquot dare do anything dastardly in front of her as she glided to his surgical table djetth looked at her wildly helplessly with mute appeal hoping that she would read his mind and help him this one last time djinniverarsquos amethyst eyes widened as if she had heard him and understood her gaze averted she reached out and dropped a gauzy white cloth of some sort over his monstrously inappropriate erection to others her action might have looked like public modesty on her part djetth assumed that djinni had read the part of his mind that was worrying about his striking tattoo that only showed up in the dark or when suitably excited thank you he thought please help me stay she nodded and took his fettered hand with her undamaged left quotyoursquove been macho about this too long jj why wonrsquot you let them put you to sleeprdquo ldquocareful my loverdquo tarrantarragon said moving possessively to her side ldquoyou can never call him jj again nor may you use any of his other damned traitorrsquos aliases not jj not commander jason traitors cannot be seen to survive their attempts on my life commander jason is officially dead and everyone mdashincluding martiadjuliamdash must believe it from this day forward hersquos prince djetthrojasonrdquo ldquowhat a mouthfulhelliprdquo djinni began then her changing expression told him that she must have read a thoughtpun he couldnrsquot resist ldquodjetthrdquo she frowned sternly ldquoi know you great djinn males canrsquot help thinking of sex all the time but itrsquos not helpful djetth as long as you have your saturniid gland yoursquore dangerousquot not dangerous to you kid you wonrsquot ovulate while yoursquore pregnant and probably not for a while after that he thought back at her her mouth twisted in a wry smile ldquoyoud be safer if you let them remove itrdquo some aspects of royal djinn maleness one would rather die than surrender he rejoined hoping she would not read his darker thoughts ldquomartiadjulia would be better off if you couldnrsquot have the rutrage again toohelliprdquo as she spoke djinni tossed her head as if shaking off a bothersome fly djetth wondered if djinni had unexpectedly channeled someone elsersquos reasoning djinni couldnrsquot possibly know how savagely martiadjulia liked to be served in bed ldquoi saw palace footage of you having the rutrage with martiadjuliardquo the little mindreaderrsquos voice rose in protest at the thought he hadnrsquot meant her to sense you saw you saw what exactly his thought question was a ploy to distract her from thinking about the rutrage but no sooner had he asked than he dreaded how detailed her reply might be ldquowhat you might expect given that the camera was behind a mirrored ceiling and you were on toprdquo she retorted keeping his tattoo a secret ldquotarrantarragon fastforwarded you because you went at it so longrdquo ldquonot that longrdquo tarrantarragon murmured maliciously probably to remind them that he was listening to djinnirsquos half of the conversation ldquolong enoughrdquo djinni said ldquodjetth you might already be a fatherrdquo ldquogranted that is remotely possiblerdquo tarrantarragon sneered while appearing to examine a wicked looking lancet ldquoletrsquos hope you werenrsquot that thorough djetthrojason or your firstborn would have to bemdashand remainmdasha bastard unfortunately my slackwit of a sister canrsquot keep a secret if martiadjulia thinks commander jason got her pregnant the rumor will be all over court before we get home and before she hears that her lover is deadrdquo djetth felt an inexplicable distress at the idea that he could never claim this theoretically possible child as his own ldquoshall we beginrdquo tarrantarragonrsquos too perceptive eyes ranged over djetthrsquos body lingering for an instant on the cloth covering his penis not for the first time in his life djetth thanked the great originator that tarrantarragon had lost the power to read minds ldquoi am staying with himrdquo djinni announced gripping his hand tightly djetth was careful not to wrap his fingers around hers or to respond to djinnirsquos comforting touch in any discernable way touching the heir apparentrsquos mate was yet another act of high treason punishable by death ldquovery well my love you may stay as long as you keep your gaze on his facerdquo tarrantarragons lips curled into a sneer he had certainly noticed the handholding ldquodjetthrojason irsquoll ask you for the last time have you declared every identifying mark on your body that my sister might recognize every scarhelliprdquo ldquoyesrdquo djetth snarled back one eye on djinni to see whether her face betrayed his lie head turned distracted by djinni and the explosion of pain in his face from speaking aloud djetth forgot that his neck was exposed where rsquorhett could reach it he felt a cold numbing touch of rsquorhettrsquos fingers on his most vital acupressure point strove to turn his head and couldnt rsquorhett is using djinncraft to put me to sleep damn rsquorhett and his secret agendas the growing paralysis had not yet reached djetthrsquos eyes as his vision dimmed his desperate gaze met the cool green inscrutable eyes of his bastard cousin and halfbrother rsquorhett hed be lucky to wake up with a new face a new and dangerous identity if he woke up ii ark imperial imperial suite ohhh jason yoursquore so big ohhh so healthy ohhh martiadjuliarsquos softly sighed grunts came more often and more forcefully in response to her loverrsquos faster and increasingly savage thrusts sexflushed and well and truly tumbled martiadjulia moved her face restlessly from side to side a glossy dampened strand of her silvery hair caught in her opensmiling mouth unnoticed martiadjulia braced her pale beautifully caredfor hands on commander jasonrsquos tanned broad shoulders as if she wanted to push him back down her body to stop him from driving quite so hard and so deeply into her he kept it up ldquowhat am i not seeingrdquo tarrantarragon mused thoughtfully tapping his pursed lips with two fingers ldquothere must be something remarkable about this particular sex marathonrdquo he rewound the retrieved backup fragment of footage and frowned as he prepared to play it in the slowest of slow motion it was only a fragment possibly it was not the right fragment it was the merest chance that it had not been deleted now martiadjulia arched her back fully extended her arms still above her head but relaxing away from the bedheadwall from what tarrantarragon could observe ndashsince commander jason was busy with martiadjuliarsquos abundant corsetenhanced cleavage and his long blond hair was in the way mdashmartiadjuliarsquos cheeks neck and chest looked sexflushed her blissshuttered blue eyes sparkled and there was a sly smile on her loveswollen lips ahhh yes this was the beginning unnoticed by jason she must have just reached for the secret panel on the wall and had started surveillance recording this was a few heartbeats after martiadjulia had decided that she wanted this longlasting male in her bed forever it was quite a damning moment martiadjulia would be mortified if anyone saw it and realized that mdashat that momentmdash she had intended to use blackmail to force commander jason to become her mate ldquotarrantarragon what are you watchingrdquo his own dear little mate demanded in her native earthling english from the bedroom doorway where she should have been taking an overdue and much needed nap given her pregnancy ldquosurveillance footagerdquo he said ldquoof a sex marathonrdquo djinni queried it was too late to switch programs djinnirsquos halfdjinn senses were as good if not better than any great djinnrsquos ldquomartiadjulia and djetthrdquo he admitted ldquodo you want to watch it with merdquo tarrantarragon deliberately ended on a hopeful note djinni was not too far along for leisurely consensual lovemaking if she might be in the mood he had no objection to playing the voyeur although mdashin truthmdash the large naked male on top was not a natural object of interest for a royal blueblooded great djinn nor was his excessively curvy sister ldquois that the footage you showed me shortly after yoursquod tricked me into saying the imperial mating vows and all the communicating worlds thought you were busy deflowering merdquo her voice vibrated with indignation tarrantarragon grinned impenitently ldquoat that time my love you were too upset to enjoy being ravished repeatedly yoursquod only just discovered my true and terrible identity i hoped some mild pornography would divert you i admit that i miscalculated how was i to know that yoursquod recognize the male in bed with my sister as your jilted fianceacuterdquo djinni tossed her unusual redbrown hair ldquoyou told me that yoursquod destroyed all that footage at martiadjuliarsquos requestrdquo she accused him her memory was flawless ldquoi distinctly remember you complaining more than once that you couldnrsquot retrieve any trace of jj or djetth as we now call himrdquo ldquoi honestly thought i had my loverdquo she raised a skeptical eyebrow the way all djinn did ldquodo you rememberhellip ahhh you wouldnrsquot because you fell asleep exhausted from crying after the saurian dragon unfairly cursed you for daring to be seduced by merdquo djinni had come near enough to be grabbed and scooped into his lap he did so and held her close with his interlocked hands cradling her belly where his heir grew a fraction of a fingerjoint every day ldquowhile you slept that day i caught martiadjulia in my office attempting to erase footage which shersquod initiated she had already made an incompetent start what martiadjulia didnrsquot know is that whenever someone who doesnrsquot know my personal code tries to erase anything on my systems it backs up to a new file here on the ark imperial rdquo ldquoonly if the ark imperial is in range i supposerdquo ldquoof courserdquo he agreed if only he had known then what he knew now he wouldnrsquot have been so quick to enter his code to stop whatever damage his wayward sister had initiated by doing so hersquod halted the automatic backup however the fragment had been preserved and it had not occurred to him to bother looking for it until djinni blurted out a very odd nonsequitur as they were preparing to operate on djetth ldquowhy are you looking at it nowrdquo his aggressively suspicious little mate demanded the percentages were not in his favor if he were to lie to his mindreading mate especially since he had recently vowed never to lie to her again ldquomy curiosity was fired by something you said to djetth my loverdquo she blushed adorably pale sheet lightning flickered in the deep violet of her telltale eyes djinni was afraid hersquod discover a secret from the footage tarrantarragon spoke so many languages fluently that it had not until now registered as significant that djinni had always conversed in english with djetth he filed that thought for later and reported what had piqued his interest in the operating theater ldquoyou told him lsquoi saw footage of you having the rutragehelliprsquo then you made a mysterious ungrammatical leap to lsquowhat you might expect given that the camera was behind the mirrored ceiling and that you were on top tarrantarragon fastforwarded youhelliprsquordquo the tiger princes of tarrantarragonrsquos generation had lost the power to read minds but he could tell when djinni was about to be economical with the truth she squirmed on his lap ldquois there any doubt in your mind little love that djetth was having the rutragerdquo he could have asked her whether shersquod read djetthrsquos mind and whether there was any doubt in djetthrsquos mind he could have asked what djetth was afraid might be exposed on the footage there were many skills tarrantarragon lacked finesse was not one of them ldquonoooordquo djinni said slowly probably truthfully ldquoi do think djetth had the rutrage but it must have been mildly or he wouldnrsquot have left martiadjuliarsquos bed after only two days he wouldnrsquot have tried to rescue me from you even if he was convinced that rescuing me was the right and honorable thing to do his encounter with martiadjulia left him very confused frustrated and angry you knowrdquo the same things had occurred to tarrantarragon ldquoirsquove heard you make disparaging comments about your sister beforerdquo djinni added as if thinking aloud ldquomaybe her fertility pheromones are dormant in a sort of sleeping beauty mode maybehelliprdquo djinni yawned and patted his cheek with her good hand ldquoi think irsquoll go back to bedrdquo her ungrammatical jump to camera angles and djetthrsquos sexually dominant position had been skirted however the fragment and its mystery could wait tarrantarragon got up and followed djinni to the bedroom he had a grammatical ambiguity of his own to put to her ldquomy love shall i join with yourdquo iii ark imperial recovery room rsquorhett had half expected to hear stealthy footsteps he did not open his heavylidded eyes or uncross his ankles under the morguelike hospital bed he gave no sign that he had not nodded off in the pullout segmented chairbed at djetthrsquos bedside he flared his nostrils slightly and breathed in the approaching cocktail of stale old spice menrsquos grooming products lungs recovering slowly from half a human lifetime of tobacco use and the nervous tang of an englishman off his world and not quite at ease among gods and aliens what was grievous doing here if tarrantarragon had sent his ldquoearthways advisorrdquo to quietly smother djetth while he was unconscious grievous would be the one to die keeping his arms folded rsquorhett slipped his right hand inside the front opening of the white saurian ambassadorrsquos uniform that he wore night and day he curled his fingers around the hidden handle of a surgical knife that hersquod palmed during the organized chaos of djetthrsquos operations ldquoyou got yours thenrdquo grievous muttered vindictively from the open doorway rsquorhett sat very still in his chair so far it would seem grievous hadnrsquot noticed that djetth was not alone ldquoserves you right you bloody dirtyfighting bastard i hope it hurtsrdquo rsquorhett understood grievousrsquos outrage djetth had not fought the duel with tarrantarragon according to angloamerican notions of good sportsmanship ldquoas if princess djinnivera didnrsquot have enough to contend withhellip and i dare say i donrsquot know the half of itrdquo grievous was right he didnrsquot know more than half of the story few did because he had been a failed assassinrsquos escort rsquorhett knew how djinnirsquos longpreserved fertile fragrance had been smuggled into the imperial palace on a sterile decoyrsquos body in order to rutenrage disgrace and destroy tarrantarragon the plot misfired because tarrantarragonrsquos greatest enemy the saurian dragon hadnrsquot known that the occasion of state was to be tarrantarragonrsquos formal mating or that the matetobetaken would be djinnivera herself consequently when tarrantarragon sniffed a maddening whiff of fertilefemale pheromones he assumed that the source was djinni it was djinni who was carried off to the imperial bed to bear the violence of his highandmightinessrsquos sudden rutraged lust since imperial allegedlyvirgin brides were traditionally treated to rough and semipublic sex there was no scandal everyone thoroughly approved of tarrantarragonrsquos depraved behavior ironically the malicious assassin had planted a small dose of djinnirsquos ovulation pheromones on tarrantarragonrsquos sister the princess martiadjulia no one had foreseen that djetth would be in the tigron imperial star space let alone at the virginsrsquo ball or that the assassinrsquos unauthorized subplot would set djetthrsquos hormones to raging it was quite possible that djetth had made love to djinniverarsquos scent on martiadjuliarsquos generous body luckily martiadjulia had been willing ldquomy boss wants you out of the wayrdquo grievous continued moving to the foot of djetthrsquos bed rsquorhett opened his eyes a slit to be absolutely sure that grievous was doing nothing more deadly than standing at a distance from djetthrsquos bed and muttering grievous had something behind his back rsquorhett balanced the small sharp knife in his hand in tigron gravity aboard the ark imperial a hardworking human jugular vein was a big enough target then he saw what grievous held djetth was aware of a threat he could hear a gruff voice like the rumbling of distant thunder sounds were muffled like falling snow there was cottony stuff over his ears his eyes wouldnrsquot open but he knew someone was in his room drifting in and out of consciousness made him all too vulnerable damn it even when he was half awake he couldnrsquot force his limbs to move the pain was tolerable it was no worse than a hangover all over that was the drugs fewmet he was as helpless as a baby he heard a closer sound a sharply indrawn breath slackdamn he couldnrsquot see couldnrsquot turn his head oh shit there were two of them ldquoprince djarrhett didnrsquot see you sir sorry to

tarrantarragonrsquos right hand man went around calling princes and titlestealing impostors sir what was grievous up to ldquotheyrsquore wire cutters grievous i imagine there is a limit to how
