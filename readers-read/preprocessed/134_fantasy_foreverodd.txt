 one waking i heard a warm wind strumming the loose screen at the open window and i thought stormy but it was not the desert air smelled faintly of roses which were not in bloom and of dust which in the mojave flourishes twelve months of the year precipitation falls on the town of pico mundo only during our brief winter this mild february night was not however sweetened by the scent of rain i hoped to hear the fading rumble of thunder if a peal had awakened me it must have been thunder in a dream holding my breath i lay listening to the silence and felt the silence listening to me the nightstand clock painted glowing numbers on the gloom 241 am for a moment i considered remaining in bed but these days i do not sleep as well as i did when i was young i am twentyone and much older than when i was twenty certain that i had company expecting to find two elvises watching over me one with a cocky smile and one with sad concern i sat up and switched on the lamp a single elvis stood in a corner a lifesize cardboard figure that had been part of a theaterlobby display for blue hawaii in a hawaiian shirt and a lei he looked selfconfident and happy back in 1961 hed had much to be happy about blue hawaii was a hit film and the album went to number one he had six gold records that year including quotcant help falling in lovequot and he was falling in love with priscilla beaulieu less happily at the insistence of his manager tom parker he had turned down the lead in west side story in favor of mediocre movie fare like follow that dream gladys presley his beloved mother had been dead three years and still he felt the loss of her acutely only twentysix hed begun to have weight problems cardboard elvis smiles eternally forever young incapable of error or regret untouched by grief a stranger to despair i envy him there is no cardboard replica of me as i once was and as i can never be again the lamplight revealed another presence as patient as he was desperate evidently he had been watching me sleep waiting for me to wake i said quothello dr jessupquot dr wilbur jessup was incapable of a response anguish flooded his face his eyes were desolate pools all hope had drowned in those lonely depths quotim sorry to see you herequot i said he made fists of his hands not with the intention of striking anything but as an expression of frustration he pressed his fists to his chest dr jessup had never previously visited my apartment and i knew in my heart that he no longer belonged in pico mundo but i clung to denial and i spoke to him again as i got out of bed quotdid i leave the door unlockedquot he shook his head tears blurred his eyes but he did not wail or even whimper fetching a pair of jeans from the closet slipping into them i said quotive been forgetful latelyquot he opened his fists and stared at his palms his hands trembled he buried his face in them quottheres so much id like to forgetquot i continued as i pulled on socks and shoes quotbut only the small stuff slips my mindlike where i left the keys whether i locked the door that im out of milk quot dr jessup a radiologist at county general hospital was a gentle man and quiet although he had never before been this quiet because i had not worn a tshirt to bed i plucked a white one from a drawer i have a few black tshirts but mostly white in addition to a selection of blue jeans i have two pair of white chinos this apartment provides only a small closet half of it is empty so are the bottom drawers of my dresser i do not own a suit or a tie or shoes that need to be shined for cool weather i own two crewneck sweaters once i bought a sweater vest temporary insanity realizing that i had introduced an unthinkable level of complexity to my wardrobe i returned it to the store the next day my fourhundredpound friend and mentor p oswald boone has warned me that my sartorial style represents a serious threat to the apparel industry ive noted more than once that the articles in ozzies wardrobe are of such enormous dimensions that he keeps in business those fabric mills i might otherwise put in jeopardy barefoot dr jessup wore cotton pajamas they were wrinkled from the rigors of restless sleep quotsir i wish youd say somethingquot i told him quoti really wish you wouldquot instead of obliging me the radiologist lowered his hands from his face turned and walked out of the bedroom i glanced at the wall above the bed framed behind glass is a card from a carnival fortunetelling machine it promises you are destined to be together forever each morning i begin my day by reading those seven words each night i read them again sometimes more than once before sleep if sleep will come to me i am sustained by the certainty that life has meaning as does death from a nightstand i retrieved my cell phone the first number on speed dial is the office of wyatt porter chief of the pico mundo police department the second is his home number the third is his cell phone more likely than not i would be calling chief porter one place or another before dawn in the living room i turned on a light and discovered that dr jessup had been standing in the dark among the thriftshop treasures with which the place is furnished when i went to the front door and opened it he did not follow although he had sought my assistance he couldnt find the courage for what lay ahead in the rubescent light from an old bronze lamp with a beaded shade the eclectic decorstickleystyle armchairs plump victorian footstools maxfield parrish prints carnivalglass vasesevidently appealed to him quotno offensequot i said quotbut you dont belong here sirquot dr jessup silently regarded me with what might have been supplication quotthis place is filled to the brim with the past theres room for elvis and me and memories but not for anyone newquot i stepped into the public hall and pulled the door shut my apartment is one of two on the first floor of a converted victorian house once a rambling singlefamily home the place still offers considerable charm for years i lived in one rented room above a garage my bed had been just a few steps from my refrigerator life was simpler then and the future clear i traded that place for this not because i needed more space but because my heart is here now and forever the front door of the house featured an oval of leaded glass the night beyond looked sharply beveled and organized into a pattern that anyone could understand when i stepped onto the porch this night proved to be like all others deep mysterious trembling with the potential for chaos from porch steps to flagstone path to public sidewalk i looked around for dr jessup but didnt see him in the high desert which rises far east beyond pico mundo winter can be chilly while our lowdesert nights remain mild even in february the curbside indian laurels sighed and whispered in the balmy wind and moths soared to street lamps the surrounding houses were as quiet as their windows were dark no dogs barked no owls hooted no pedestrians were out no traffic on the streets the town looked as if the rapture had occurred as if only i had been left behind to endure the reign of hell on earth by the time i reached the corner dr jessup rejoined me his pajamas and the lateness of the hour suggested that he had come to my apartment from his home on jacaranda way five blocks north in a better neighborhood than mine now he led me in that direction he could fly but he plodded i ran drawing ahead of him although i dreaded what i would find no less than he might have dreaded revealing it to me i wanted to get to it quickly as far as i knew a life might still be in jeopardy halfway there i realized that i could have taken the chevy for most of my driving life having no car of my own i borrowed from friends as needed the previous autumn i had inherited a 1980 chevrolet camaro berlinetta coupe often i still act as though i have no wheels owning a few thousand pounds of vehicle oppresses me when i think about it too much because i try not to think about it i sometimes forget i have it under the cratered face of the blind moon i ran on jacaranda way the jessup residence is a whitebrick georgian with elegant ornamentation it is flanked by a delightful american victorian with so many decorative moldings that it resembles a wedding cake and by a house that is baroque in all the wrong ways none of these architectural styles seems right for the desert shaded by palm trees brightened by climbing bougainvillea our town was founded in 1900 by newcomers from the east coast who fled the harsh winters but brought with them coldclimate architecture and attitude terri stambaugh my friend and employer owner of the pico mundo grille tells me that this displaced architecture is better than the dreary acres of stucco and graveled roofs in many california desert towns i assume that she is right i have seldom crossed the city line of pico mundo and have never been beyond the boundaries of maravilla county my life is too full to allow either a jaunt or a journey i dont even watch the travel channel the joys of life can be found anywhere far places only offer exotic ways to suffer besides the world beyond pico mundo is haunted by strangers and i find it difficult enough to cope with the dead who in life were known to me upstairs and down soft lamplight shone at some windows of the jessup residence most panes were dark by the time i reached the foot of the frontporch steps dr wilbur jessup waited there the wind stirred his hair and ruffled his pajamas although why he should be subject to the wind i do not know the moonlight found him too and shadow the grieving radiologist needed comforting before he could summon sufficient strength to lead me into his house where he himself no doubt lay dead and perhaps another i embraced him only a spirit he was invisible to everyone but me yet he felt warm and solid perhaps i see the dead affected by the weather of this world and see them touched by light and shadow and find them as warm as the living not because this is the way they are but because this is the way i want them to be perhaps by this device i mean to deny the power of death my supernatural gift might reside not in my mind but instead in my heart the heart is an artist that paints over what profoundly disturbs it leaving on the canvas a less dark less sharp version of the truth dr jessup had no substance but he leaned heavily upon me a weight he shook with the sobs that he could not voice the dead dont talk perhaps they know things about death that the living are not permitted to learn from them in this moment my ability to speak gave me no advantage words would not soothe him nothing but justice could relieve his anguish perhaps not even justice when hed been alive he had known me as odd thomas a local character i am regarded by some peoplewronglyas a hero as an eccentric by nearly everyone odd is not a nickname its my legal handle the story of my name is interesting i suppose but ive told it before what it boils down to is that my parents are dysfunctional bigtime i believe that in life dr jessup had found me intriguing amusing puzzling i think he had liked me only in death did he know me for what i am a companion to the lingering dead i see them and wish i did not i cherish life too much to turn the dead away however for they deserve my compassion by virtue of having suffered this world when dr jessup stepped back from me he had changed his wounds were now manifest he had been hit in the face with a blunt object maybe a length of pipe or a hammer repeatedly his skull was broken his features distorted torn cracked splintered his hands suggested that he had desperately tried to defend himselfor that he had come to the aid of someone the only person living with him was his son danny my pity was quickly exceeded by a kind of righteous rage which is a dangerous emotion clouding judgment precluding caution in this condition which i do not seek which frightens me which comes over me as though i have been possessed i cant turn away from what must be done i plunge my friends those few who know my secrets think my compulsion has a divine inspiration maybe its just temporary insanity step to step ascending then crossing the porch i considered phoning chief wyatt porter i worried however that danny might perish while i placed the call and waited for the authorities the front door stood ajar i glanced back and saw that dr jessup preferred to haunt the yard instead of the house he lingered in the grass his wounds had vanished he appeared as he had appeared before death had found himand he looked scared until they move on from this world even the dead can know fear you would think they have nothing to lose but sometimes they are wretched with anxiety not about what might lie beyond but about those whom they have left behind i pushed the door inward it moved as smoothly as silently as the mechanism of a wellcrafted springloaded trap
