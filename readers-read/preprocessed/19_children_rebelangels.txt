december 1895 spence academy for young ladies ah christmas the very mention of the holiday conjures such precious sentimental memories for most a tall evergreen tree hung with tinsel and glass gaily wrapped presents strewn about a roaring fire and glasses filled with cheer carolers grouped round the door their jaunty hats catching the snow as it falls a nice fat goose resting upon a platter surrounded by apples and of course fig pudding for dessert right jolly good i should like to see that very much these images of christmas cheer are miles away from where i sit now at the spence academy for young ladies forced to construct a drummer boy ornament using only tinfoil cotton and a small bit of string as if performing some diabolical experiment in cadaver regeneration mary shelleys monster could not be half so frightening as this ridiculous thing the figure will not remind a soul of christmas happiness more likely it will reduce children to tears quotthis is impossiblequot i grumble i elicit no pity from any quarter even felicity and ann my two dearest friends which is to say my only friends here will not come to my aid ann is determined to turn wet sugar and small bits of kindling into an exact replica of the christ child in a manger she seems to take no notice of anything beyond her own two hands for her part felicity turns her cool gray eyes to me as if to say suffer i am no instead it is the beastly cecily temple who answers me dear dear cecily or as i affectionately refer to her in the privacy of my mind she who inflicts misery simply by breathing quoti cannot fathom what is giving you such trouble miss doyle really it is the simplest thing in the world look ive done four alreadyquot she holds out her four perfect tinfoil boys for inspection there is a round of oohing and aahing over their beautifully shaped arms the tiny woolen scarvesknit by cecilys capable hands but of courseand those delicate licorice smiles that make them seem overjoyed to be hanging by the neck from a christmas tree two weeks until christmas and my mood blackens by the hour the tinfoil boy seems to be begging me to shoot him compelled by a force larger than myself i cannot seem to keep from placing the crippled ornament boy on the side table and performing a little show i move the ugly thing forcing him to drag his useless leg like mr dickenss treacly tiny tim quotgod bless us every onequot i warble in a pathetic highpitched voice this is greeted by horrified silence every eye is averted even felicity who is not known as the soul of decorum seems cowed behind me there is the familiar sound of a throat being cleared in grand disapproval i turn to see mrs nightwing spences frosty headmistress staring down at me as if i were a leper blast quotmiss doyle do you suppose that to be humorous making light of the very real pain of londons unfortunatesquot quotii why quot mrs nightwing peers at me over her spectacles her graying pouf of hair is like a nimbus warning of the storm to come quotperhaps miss doyle if you were to spend time in service to the poor wrapping bandages as i once did in my own youth during the crimean war you would acquire a healthy and muchneeded dose of sympathyquot quotyyes mrs nightwing i dont know how i could have been so unkindquot i blabber out of the corner of my eye i can see felicity and ann hunched over their ornaments as if they were fascinating relics from an archeological dig i note that their shoulders are trembling and i realize that they are fighting laughter over my terrible plight theres friendship for you quotfor this you shall lose ten good conduct marks and i shall expect you to perform an act of charity during the holiday as penancequot quotyes mrs nightwingquot quotyou shall write a full account of this charitable act and tell me how it has enriched your characterquot quotyes mrs nightwingquot quotand that ornament needs much workquot quotyes mrs nightwingquot quothave you any questionsquot quotyes mrs nightwing i meant no mrs nightwing thank youquot an act of charity over the holiday would enduring time with my brother thomas count toward that end blast ive done it now quotmrs nightwingquot the sheer sound of cecilys voice could make me froth at the mouth quoti hope these are satisfactory i do so want to be of service to the unfortunatequot its possible that i shall lose consciousness from holding back a very loud ha at this cecily who never misses an opportunity to tease ann about her scholarship status wants nothing to do with the poor what she does want is to be mrs nightwings lapdog mrs nightwing holds cecilys perfect ornaments up to the light for inspection quotthese are exemplary miss temple i commend youquot cecily gives a very smug smile quotthank you mrs nightwingquot ah christmas with a heavy sigh i take apart my pathetic ornament and begin again my eyes burn and blur i rub them but it does no good what i need is sleep but sleep is the very thing i fear for weeks ive been haunted by wicked warnings of dreams i cannot remember much when i awaken only snatches here and there a sky roiling with red and gray a painted flower dripping tears of blood strange forests of light my face grave and questioning reflected in water but the images that stay with me are of her beautiful and sad quotwhy did you leave me herequot she cries and i cannot answer quoti want to come back i want us to be together againquot i break away and run but her cry finds me quotits your fault gemma you left me here you left mequot that is all i remember when i wake each morning before dawn gasping and covered in perspiration more tired than when i went to bed they are only dreams then why do they leave me feeling so troubled
