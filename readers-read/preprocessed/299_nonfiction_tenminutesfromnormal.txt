the train felt odd slow and lethargic a marked contrast to the hyperactivity of the justfinished republican national convention a convention is a riot of balloons speeches people and parties but suddenly the noise had stopped someone had slammed on the brakes and we were on a slow roll across the midwest seeing the occasional cow the convention had been a great success the moment we had all been working toward the moment we nominated my boss as the republican candidate for president of the united states of america a coronation a culmination yet like so many big events in a presidential campaign oddly unsatisfying the planning and organizing that had led to that moment had been years in the making the past several months had been devoted almost entirely to building toward the convention writing the speech organizing the themes planning every scripted moment of national television coverage but then before we were able to truly celebrate or absorb it all it was over and we were back on the trail or in this case the train track always on to the next thing a presidential campaign is relentless you win a straw poll or a primary or a debate or the daily news headline and wake up to people already talking and asking about the next one you win in iowa lose in new hampshire get back on track in south carolina only to lose in michigan three days later and wonder yet again are we missing something but youre on a plane to california where theres a debate coming up then flying cross country for next weeks critical primary in virginia once you start the only way to stop is to lose and that of course is not the way you want to get off of this train the reporters on board were all restless through long stretches of rural pennsylvania and across ohio their cell phones didnt work much of the time al gore could have dropped out of the race and we wouldnt even know it one complained to me we should be so lucky i replied the biggest excitement came when a woman mooned the train causing a great stir among all on board and endless speculation about what exactly she was trying to say with her show by the second day the sleepy routine had begun to feel a little more natural long hours of rocking along the track punctuated by brief rallies in small towns and waves off the back to small groups of people who gathered at crossings bringing their children to witness a little piece of american political history we were approaching a town in illinois when the conductor came over the loudspeaker and proudly announced ladies and gentlemen we are ten minutes from normal ten minutes from normal if i ever write a book thats going to be the title i told my colleagues in the staff car 10 minutes from normal is exactly how i feel about this whole bizarre experience ive always considered myself a very normal person who had at least until recently a very normal life with a normal family and normal friends except of course i have a boss and friend who became the president and while that is often thrilling and even sometimes still surprising it is most definitely not normal at times it still strikes me when im standing backstage and the band plays hail to the chief which doesnt happen that often because the president is quite humble and tries to balance the grandeur and stature of the office with his desire not to inflate his own sense of selfimportance and he walks on stage and i am amazed that is the president of the united states and i know him and he knows me he knows my husband and son we have had dinners together ive even cooked some of them and so has he i know how he takes his coffee he knows that i am tall not big because we have had that conversation women who are 5 feet ten and a half and wear size 12 shoes do not like to be called big we prefer the more stately tall my friend condi rice says its like sweating southern women do not sweat especially if you grew up as she did in birmingham alabama southern women only perspire tall people in back the president says to me during the group photograph at last years senior staff christmas dinner winking to show he got it he remembers i have a very normal family a teenage son who thinks that i am totally annoying especially when i ask intrusive questions like how was your day or even try to talk to him when he gets in the car after school because hes tired tired of talking i wonder how is that possible since he doesnt and a husband who puts up with us all and only occasionally gets irritated when i ask him for the third time today whether he loves me and then refuse to be satisfied when he tells me yes but its hard its not that hard i protest not too hard he replies agreeably which of course is not the answer i want to hear i have a grown daughter for sake of complete accuracy i should say a stepdaughter but my husband had custody of her and we married when she was nine she lived with us and i nursed her through chicken pox and creating categories of children in a family always struck me as wrong so i always call her my daughter and a granddaughter who has inherited a strong will and streak of independence from all sides of our family we have a cat griffey the only cat our family has ever had who actually comes when he is called and would be an almost perfect pet which my husband defines as not requiring much in the way of service except for a terrible habit of choosing to throw up on the carpet instead of the tile floor even if the tile floor is closer and he has to go to another room in midcough to find some soft lovely hardtoclean carpet on which to deposit his most recent hairball i also live with an exuberant golden retriever a rambunctious and bouncy and eager dog who never has learned to keep all four feet on the ground or her tongue in and nose out of unwelcome places shes quite loveable if a bit enthusiastic thats what i think at least my husband and the dog have a strained relationship i would like to think it dates to the time i let the dog spend the night in the house because it was cold outside in washington and the first night she was perfect but the second night she chewed up a blue ballpoint ink pen on the light whitebeige carpet but its actually much deeper than that jerry ended up taking care of the last dog a ditzy cocker spaniel named fritzi who was sweet but kind of stupid and while i was fond of her i never really bonded in the way that you bond with a real dog a large and intelligent one your dog gets in the cat litter how intelligent is that jerry asks notice the pronoun not our dog as in the family pet but your dog as in all mine jerry used to laugh when the media described me as a control freak or the person who controlled the white house message anyone who thinks shes in control ought to come and meet our animals he would say writing about the pets is oddly personal and i realize this story will involve the people close to me more than perhaps i realized or wanted im going to have to write about you in my book i inform my husband in between commercials for er one of the few shows we watch on television i didnt agree to that he protests ever the lawyer you agreed i should write this book i answer i cant write a book about my life without writing about our family it wouldnt be true it wouldnt be honest i protest he looks unconvinced this is supposed to be a book about your political life your life at the white house he says no remember its a book about a lot of things how a normal person like me ended up working at the white house what it was like its not a typical political gossip book i sputter this book is about life and family and faith and important things and i cant write about what is important without writing about you and robert you can mention us but keep it brief he replies
