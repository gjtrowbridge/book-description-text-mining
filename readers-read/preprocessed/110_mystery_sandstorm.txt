 chapter one fire and rain november 14 0133 am the british museum london england harry masterson would be dead in thirteen minutes if he had known this he wouldve smoked his last cigarette down to the filter instead he stamped out the fag after only three drags and waved the cloud from around his face if he was caught smoking outside the guards break room he would be shitcanned by that bastard fleming head of museum security harry was already on probation for coming in two hours late for his shift last week harry swore under his breath and pocketed the stubbed cigarette hed finish it at his next break that is if they got a break this night thunder echoed through the masonry walls the winter storm had struck just after midnight opening with a riotous volley of hail followed by a deluge that threatened to wash london into the thames lightning danced across the skies in forked displays from one horizon to another according to the weatherman on the beeb it was one of the fiercest electrical storms in over a decade half the city had been blacked out overwhelmed by a spectacular lightning barrage and as fortune would have it for harry it was his half of the city that went dark including the british museum on great russell street though they had backup generators the entire security team had been summoned for additional protection of the museums property they would be arriving in the next half hour but harry assigned to the night shift was already on duty when the regular lights went out and though the video surveillance cameras were still operational on the emergency grid he and the shift were ordered by fleming to proceed with an immediate security sweep of the museums two and a half miles of halls that meant splitting up harry picked up his electric torch and aimed it down the hall he hated doing rounds at night when the museum was lost in gloom the only illumination came from the streetlamps outside the windows but now with the blackout even those lamps had been extinguished the museum had darkened to macabre shadows broken by pools of crimson from the lowvoltage security lamps harry had needed a few hits of nicotine to steel his nerve but he could put off his duty no longer being the low man on the night shifts pecking order he had been assigned to run the halls of the north wing the farthest point from their underground security nest but that didnt mean he couldnt take a shortcut turning his back on the long hall ahead he crossed to the door leading into the queen elizabeth ii great court this central twoacre court was surrounded by the four wings of the british museum at its heart rose the great copperdomed round reading room one of the worlds finest libraries overhead the entire twoacre courtyard had been enclosed by a gigantic foster and partners150designed geodesic roof creating europes largest covered square using his passkey harry ducked into the cavernous space like the museum proper the court was lost to darkness rain pattered against the glass roof far overhead still harrys footsteps echoed across the open space another lance of lightning shattered across the sky the roof divided into a thousand triangular panes lit up for a blinding moment then darkness drowned back over the museum drumming down with the rain thunder followed felt deep in the chest the roof rattled too harry ducked a bit fearing the entire structure would come crashing down with his electric torch pointed forward he crossed the court heading for the north wing he rounded past the central reading room lightning flashed again brightening the place for a handful of heartbeats giant statues lost to the darkness appeared as if from nowhere the lion of cnidos reared beside the massive head of an easter island statue then darkness swallowed the guardians away as the lightning died out harry felt a chill and pebbling of gooseflesh his pace hurried he swore under his breath with each step bleeding buggered pieces of crap his litany helped calm him he reached the doors to the north wing and ducked inside greeted by the familiar mix of mustiness and ammonia he was grateful to have solid walls around him again he played his torch down the long hall nothing seemed amiss but he was required to check each of the wings galleries he did a fast calculation if he hurried he could complete his circuit with enough time for another fast smoke with the promise of a nicotine fix luring him he set off down the hall the beam of his torch preceding him the north wing had become host to the museums anniversary showcase an ethnographical collection portraying a complete picture of human achievement down the ages spanning all cultures like the egyptian gallery with its mummies and sarcophagi he continued hurriedly ticking off the various cultural galleries celtic byzantine russian chinese each suite of rooms was locked down by a security gate with the loss of power the gates had dropped automatically at last the halls end came into sight most of the galleries collections were only temporarily housed here transferred from the museum of mankind for the anniversary celebration but the end gallery had always been here for as far back as harry could recall it housed the museums arabian display a priceless collection of antiquity from across the arabian peninsula the gallery had been commissioned and paid for by one family a family grown rich by its oil ventures in that region the donations to keep such a gallery in permanent residence at the british museum was said to top five million pounds per annum one had to respect that sort of dedication
