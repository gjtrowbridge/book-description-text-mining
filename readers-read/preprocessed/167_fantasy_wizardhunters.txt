 chapter 1 vienne ilerien it was nine oclock at night and tremaine was trying to find a way to kill herself that would bring in a verdict of natural causes in court when someone banged on the door dammit a couple of books on poisons slid from her lap as she struggled out of the overstuffed armchair she managed to hold on to the second volume of medical jurisprudence closing it over her finger to mark her place the search for the elusive untraceable poison was not going well there were too many ways sorcererphysicians could uncover such things and she didnt want it to look as if she had been murdered intracranial hemorrhage seemed a good possibility if a little difficult to arrange on ones own but im a valiarde i should be able to figure this out she thought sourly dragging the blanket around her she picked her way through the piles of books to the door the library at coldcourt was ideal for this being large eclectic and packed with every book treatise and monograph on murder and mayhem available to the civilized world the entry hall was dark except for a single electric bulb burning in the converted gas fixture above the sweep of the stairs the light fell on yellowed plaster walls and rich old wood and a blueandgoldpatterned carpet on polished stone tile coldcourt was aptly named and tremaines bare feet were half frozen by the time she made it to the front door she had let the housekeeper have the night off and now she regretted it but she had had no idea it would take this long to arrange things at this rate she wouldnt be dead until next week the unwanted person was still banging who is it she shouted wondering if he could hear her coldcourt had been built as a country house and its walls were thick natural stone to withstand the vienne winter it was part of an aging neighborhood of small estates just outside the old city wall and sprawled in asymmetrical crenellated and embellished glory across its poorly kept grounds the door was several inches thick old oak plated with not entirely decorative embossed lead proof against bullets and other less solid assaults the windows above the door were heavy leaded glass threaded with silver the blackout curtains fixed tightly all buildings had the blackout curtains stipulated by the civilian defense board but the other protections were peculiarly coldcourts though all its wards against sorcerous attack were no help in the current situation a muffled voice replied its gerard oh god tremaine leaned her forehead tiredly against the chill wood surface as executor of her fathers estate guilliame gerard had been her guardian until she was twentyone but she had seen him only infrequently these past few years her first thought was that her supervisor in the siege aid group must have written to him tremaine had joined the aid society because they worked in the bombedout areas of the city searching for survivors or bringing supplies to the fire brigades and the war departments rescue teams it was hard desperate work and many of them even experienced men like constables or fire brigade members or former soldiers were killed by unexploded bombs or collapsing buildings a small woman who had never been very good at games in school shouldnt have been able to last a week tremaines life should have ended with no more fanfare than a line in the casualty columns of the newspapers anything else would surely lead to a magistrates investigation which might uncover even more unpleasant facts about her familys immediate past than had already been exposed that was the last thing she needed but tremaine had been in the aid society for six months she probably still couldnt hit a lawn tennis ball properly but she could climb scramble over under and through rubble like a squirrel dodge flying debris and when a ghoul had leapt out at her from a halfcollapsed cellar the instinct to beat it to pieces with a lead pipe had triumphed over the will to die but after six months of neardeathbutneverquite experiences her supervisor had told her she was due a months leave before she could enlist for another term tremaine had protested with a patriotic fervor that her old friends in the theater would have admired those who were still alive anyway but she had given in when she had seen the look in the womans eye the supervisor was the duchess of duncanny used to managing estates on a grand scale and she had been trained as a hospital nurse early in the war she was too perceptive by far and tremaine had looked into those old eyes and thought she knows she knows why im here it was time to leave the aid society and find some other way she must have contacted gerard shit shit shit shit wincing tremaine turned the heavy key and drew the bolts gerard slipped in by habit pushing the heavy door shut quickly so a betraying light wouldnt escape the outskirts of vienne were considered an unlikely target area and tremaine hadnt heard any bomb warnings on the wireless earlier he was a tall man in his early forties with dark hair just lightly touched with gray his tie was askew and his tweed jacket stained with dark patches his spectacles caught the light as he stared down at her in consternation tremaine im sorry to burst in on you like this but something terrible has happened they broke the wards she thought staring at him blankly the palace is destroyed a bubble of hysterical laughter grew in her chest it was over there would be no messy inquests or embarrassing articles in the papers to avoid the gardier had won and she could bash her own head in with a rock and no one would think twice about it the palace was bombed no gerard gave her an odd look oh no not that terrible he took a sharp breath gathering his thoughts ive just come from the project the last test sphere was destroyed oh tremaine wet her lips trying to catch up he meant the viller institutes defense project outside the city she gathered the blanket around her and fumbled the large book into a more comfortable grip trailing gerard further into the hall do you need me to write a bank draft she asked vaguely there were people in the city who did that and handled the other business affairs of the institute but perhaps those offices had been hit or evacuated i thought the government requisitioned anything you needed now gerard stopped to face her impatiently tremaine listen to me he blinked as he took in her appearance is that your nightdress its a smock an artists smock most of tremaines clothes were wornout the couturier she had patronized had closed down and left the city and she hadnt had time or inclination to stand in the lines at the stores for months i never mind now whats happened the sphere we were using for the experiment was destroyed gerard explained the riardin prototype of the viller sphere the last one we had that time she understood him was destroyed suddenly angry tremaine dumped medical jurisprudence on the marble console table what the hell do you mean was destroyed by who by riardin his face grim gerard adjusted his spectacles it killed him and selfdestructed tremaine let out her breath and pinched the bridge of her nose moron she muttered but it didnt surprise her it was hardly the first time this project had killed someone he was overzealous gerard admitted but he was the best we had im now the highestranking sorcerer on the project he took a deep breath as if he was still trying to take stock of that himself tremaine looked up at him frowning lodun university had been sealed off by its own wards and lay under heavy sorcerous siege by the gardier it had been impenetrable for the past two years and no one had been able to get close enough to discover whether the sorcerers and townspeople trapped inside were still alive or not since then sorcerers who could be spared from the border and coastal defenses were in short supply gerard was more than competent but he wasnt up to the flamboyant riardins level one of the benefits of suicide was not having to watch while what was left of her friends went before her gerard the other spheres were specifically keyed to riardin he built them he worked with them theres no time to build another for me his expression was grave i need the damal prototype oh arisilde damal had been the greatest sorcerer in the history of ilerien tremaine had called him uncle ari she stared at gerard for a moment nonplussed then realized he was asking for her permission well yes of course gerard started for the stairs halting in confusion when tremaine veered back toward the library still dragging her blanket he demanded you dont keep it in the vaults upstairs it gets lonely its cold and dark up there thats probably what made the two early spheres die you know there had been three original spheres constructed by edouard viller tremaines foster grandfather kept in the secret storerooms in coldcourts attics two had quietly died in their years of inactivity and the last had been destroyed by arisilde damal himself in the course of a powerful spell when tremaines father nicholas valiarde had endowed the viller institute to continue edouard villers work arisilde had worked with the natural philosophers employed by it to recreate villers original design tremaine led the way into the library the books had overflowed the floortoceiling shelves long ago and invaded the parlor next door and several rooms on the second floor but the main part of the collection was still housed here though it badly needed dusting it was still the coziest room in the house with colorful antique parscian carpets and overstuffed armchairs it was also the only room without blank spots on its walls where paintings had been taken down silent reminders of the imminent danger of invasion following the instructions her father had left behind tremaine had had his art collection removed to a sealed hidden vault below the valiarde importing offices in vienne along with some of the furniture the older books her mothers jewelry and other valuables since then tremaine had had the feeling the house was an empty shell nothing left behind including herself she went to the glassfronted cabinet against the far wall and opened a drawer to search for the key sorry to burst in on you like this i know youre on leave from the aid society gerard glanced at the meager fire in the grate and the pile of books surrounding her armchair are you writing something again uh huh tremaine gave up on the key buried amid the welter of pencil stubs scraps of paper and several decades accumulation of unidentifiable odds and ends and popped the lock on the cabinet doors with a hard jerk the sphere rested on an upper shelf crowded in with old yellowed notebooks and folios it was a small croquet ballsize device formed of coppercolored metal strips filled with tiny wheels and gears she lifted it off the shelf her fingers going a little numb with the mild shock of the power shivering through the metal she breathed on it and the sphere warmed to her touch she gathered it against her chest as she shut the cabinet door no magical locks no secret devices gerard said a little sadly as he stepped up behind her the valiardes have come down in the world no really gerard had been a trusted crony of her father so he was entitled to the observation but tremaine still felt more than a twinge just stab me in the gut while youre at it why dont you she muttered sorry he actually sounded sorry as he accepted the sphere from her he added wistfully i was rather fond of the secret magical locks so was i tremaine looked into the sphere watching the blue and gold lights chase each other along the metal pathways alchemy and natural philosophy were powerfully mated in the design she hadnt a clue how it did what it did this particular sphere had never been part of the institutes studies uncle ari had given it to her when she was a little girl the day her pet cat had died of old age he had said it would be cruel to prolong the cats life but that this could be her friend too it wont catch mice but it can purr he had told her uncle ari hadnt always been playing with a full deck of cards but he had been very sweet he had been the first sorcerer to begin the viller institutes great project and one of the first to die of it she said give it a minute to warm up gerard watched her gravely i handled this one when arisilde first charged it but that was years ago is it easy to work with she shrugged i never had any trouble with it but then i never used it for spells not real ones you didnt have to be a sorcerer to make the sphere work but you did need to have some latent magical talent tremaines greatgrandmother had been a powerful witch and all her mothers family had had talent to one extent or another though her mother had been an actress rather than a sorceress as a child tremaine had had enough magic to make the sphere find lost toys and produce small illusions and colored light shows but even that ability had faded with lack of practice she supposed she would never see the device again any progress she asked not expecting an optimistic answer besides riardin blowing himself up not that that was progress but gerard knew her too well to take offense i think were close the experiment riardin was conducting he was approaching the spell from an entirely new angle he shook his head pulling his spectacles off to rub his eyes were very close to deciphering arisildes architecture so youll know exactly what killed uncle ari and my father tremaine turned the sphere watching the sparks travel deeper into its depths it was active tonight more so than she had ever seen it before perhaps because she hadnt had it out since last year last year maybe its been longer than that they wanted to save us from this tremaine gerard said quietly he gestured at the blackout curtains tightly covering the librarys narrow windows from this war i know nicholas valiarde and arisilde damal had been the first to discover the early traces of the gardier that faceless enemy that appeared out of nowhere that attacked without reason with power that destroyed conventional weapons and magic alike that had been years before the devastating attack on the city of lodun before the small country of adera had been overrun and forced to serve as a gardier staging area for attacks on ilerien tremaine didnt blame nicholas and arisilde for what had happened afterward it had been an accident a series of miscalculations on the part of two men who had been treading a fine line between life and death all their lives with a sigh tremaine held the sphere out to gerard uncle ari never wanted to make weapons he took the sphere from her handling it carefully it may sound overdramatic but this could be the salvation of he stared into the sphere with consternation its gone dead no frowning she took it back she shook it a little making gerard wince but then he was used to the more delicate and temperamental instruments constructed by riardin and the others who were trying to duplicate arisildes work its fine she held it out showing him the lights moving deep within the device gerard took the sphere again and tremaine leaned over it frowning as the life faded out of it she shook her head in annoyance taking it back from him it worked for you before didnt it she shook the sphere again and he hurriedly stopped her he said perhaps i havent worked with it in more than ten years he blinked struck by the enormity of the possible disaster if thats the case we have no working spheres to continue the experiment you mean its forgotten you brows drawn together tremaine held it out to him again try to use it while im holding it something simple gerard rested his fingers lightly on the sphere frowning in concentration for a moment tremaine thought nothing would happen then a swirl of illusory light drifted across the fine old carpet near the hearth sparkling like fayre dust making both the fire in the grate and the electric bulb in the lamp dim and shiver gerard let out his breath and released the sphere the light vanished it still knows me but it apparently wants contact with you also he met her eyes his face serious tremaine i hate to ask you this but its vital for the continuation of the experiment were so close to success tremaine looked around at the library gesturing vaguely she couldnt afford to get involved in anything right now im sort of in the middle of something i know its dangerous but if you could dangerous tremaine stared at him thats perfect she nodded give me a few minutes to get dressed
