 across the spiral arm the gasgiant planets held secrets dangers and treasure for a century and a half harvesting vital stardrive fuel from the cloud worlds had been a lucrative business for the roamers five years ago though that had all changed like vicious guard dogs the hydrogues had forbidden all skymines from approaching the gas giants they claimed as their territory the embargo had crippled the roamer economy the terran hanseatic league and the ildiran empire many brave or foolish entrepreneurs had defied the hydrogues ultimatum they had paid with their lives dozens of skymines were destroyed the deepcore aliens were unstoppable and ruthless but when facing desperate situations roamers refused to give up instead they changed tactics surviving151and thriving151through innovation the old speaker always told us that challenges redefine the parameters of success jess tamblyn said over the open comm taking his lookout ship into position above the deceptively peacefullooking gas giant welyr by damn jess del kellum transmitted with just a touch of annoyance if i wanted to be pampered id live on earth kellum an older clan leader and handson industrialist signaled to the converging fastdive scoop ships the cluster of modified blitzkrieg skymines and a hodgepodge of small lookout craft gathered at what they hoped was a safe distance above the coppery planet no one knew how far away the hydrogues could detect trespassing cloud thieves but they had long since given up playing it safe in the end all life was a gamble and human civilization could not survive without stardrive fuel the ektiscavenging crew powered up their huge scoops and containers ready for a concerted plunge into the thick cloud decks hit and run their supercharged engines glowed warm their pilots sweated ready alone in his lookout ship jess flexed his hands on the cockpit controls prepare to come from all sides move in fast gulp a bellyful and head for safety we dont know how long the drogue bastards will give us after the big harvesting ships acknowledged they dropped like hawks after prey what once had been a routine industrial process had become a commando operation in a war zone when presented with the hydrogue threat daring roamer engineers had redesigned traditional skymining facilities they had accomplished a lot in five years the new blitzkrieg scoops had giant engines superefficient ekti reactors and detachable cargo tanks like a cluster of grapes once each tank was filled it could be launched up to a retrieval point passing off the harvested ekti a bit at a time without losing a full cargo load if151 when 151the hydrogues came after them kellum transmitted the big goose thinks were shiftless bandits by damn lets give the drogues the same impression the hansa151the big goose151paid dearly for every drop of stardrive fuel as ekti supplies dwindled year after year prices skyrocketed to a point that roamers considered the risk acceptable five of the modified scoops now dispersed across the atmosphere then plunged into welyrs clouds storm upwellings and vanishingly thin winds with giant funnelmaws open the blitzkrieg scoops roared through storm systems at top speed they gobbled resources compressing the excess into hydrogenholding tanks while secondary ekti reactors processed the gas as he flew his lookout mission like a man in the crows nest of an ancient pirate ship jess deployed floating sensors into welyrs soupy clouds the buoys would detect any large ships rising from the depths the sensors might give only a few minutes warning but the daredevils could retreat quickly enough jess knew that it did no good to fight the ildiran solar navy and the hansa edf had demonstrated that lesson often enough at the first sign of the enemys arrival his renegade harvesters would turn and run with whatever ekti theyd managed to grab the first blitzkrieg scoop filled one cargo tank and rose high enough to jettison it leaving a smoke trail in the thin air a resounding cheer echoed across the comm and the competitive roamers challenged each other to do better the unmanned fuel tank soared away from welyr toward its rendezvous point safe in times past leisurely skymines had drifted over the clouds like whales feeding on plankton jesss brother ross had been the chief of blue sky mine on golgen hed had dreams an excellent business sense and all the hopes in the world without warning though hydrogues had obliterated the facility killing every member of the crew jess monitored his scans though the sinking sensor buoys detected no turbulence that might signal the approach of the enemy he didnt let his attention waver welyr seemed much too quiet and peaceful deceptive every crewman aboard the blitzkrieg scoops was tense knowing they had only one chance here and that some of them would likely die as soon as the hydrogues arrived heres a second one highestquality ekti del kellums harvester launched a full cargo tank within moments each of the five blitzkrieg scoops had ejected a load of ekti the scavengers had been at welyr for less than three hours and already it was a valuable haul good way to thumb our noses at the drogues kellum continued his anxiety manifesting as chattiness over the comm band though id prefer to slam them with a few comets just like you did at golgen jess jess smiled grimly his cometary bombardment had made him a hero among the roamers and he hoped that the planet was now uninhabitable all the enemy aliens destroyed a strike back i was just following my guiding star now many clans looked to jess for suggestions on how they might continue their retaliation against the aliens nonsensical prohibition you and i have a lot in common kellum said his voice more conspiratorial now that he had switched to a private frequency and if you ever do another bombardment might i suggest this place as a target what have you got against welyr then he remembered ah you were planning to marry shareen of the pasternak clan yes by damn shareen pasternak had been the chief of a skymine on welyr jess recalled that the woman had an acidly sarcastic sense of humor and a sharp tongue but kellum had been delighted with her it would have been the second marriage for both of them but shareens skymine had been destroyed in the early hydrogue depredations now three more ekti cargo tanks launched away from the racing blitzkrieg scoops trish ng the pilot of a second lookout ship frantically radioed jess cutting off the conversation the sensor buoys check the readings jess he saw a standard carrier wave with a tiny blip in the background its just a lightning strike dont get jumpy ng that same lightning strike repeats every twentyone seconds like clockwork she waited a beat jess its an artificial signal copied looped and reflected back at us the drogues mustve already destroyed the sensor buoys its a ruse jess watched and the pattern became apparent thats all the warning were going to get everybody pack up and head out as if realizing they had been discovered seven immense warglobes rose like murderous leviathans from welyrs deep clouds the roamer scavengers did not hesitate retreating pellmell up through the gas giants skies a deepthroated subsonic hum came from the alien spheres and pyramidal protrusions on their crystalline skins crackled with blue lightning the roamer daredevils had all seen the enemy shoot their destructive weapons before kellum ejected four empty ekti cargo tanks throwing them like grapeshot at the nearest warglobes choke on these jess shouted into the comm dont wait just leave kellums diversion worked the aliens targeted their blue lightning on the empty projectiles giving the blitzkrieg scoops a few more seconds to escape the roamers fired their enormous engines and four of the five harvester scoops lifted on an escape trajectory but one of the new vessels hung behind just a moment too long and the enemy lightning bolts ripped the facility to molten shreds the crews screams echoed across the comm channel then cut off instantly go go jess yelled disperse and get out of here the remaining commando harvesters scattered like flies the automated cargo tanks would go to their pickup coordinates where the commandos could retrieve the haul at their leisure the warglobes rose up shooting more blue lightning into space they struck and destroyed a lagging lookout ship but the others escaped the enemy spheres remained above the atmosphere for some time like growling wolves before they slowly descended back into the coppery storms of welyr without pursuing though dismayed at the loss of one blitzkrieg scoop and a lookout ship the raiders were already tallying the ekti they had harvested and projecting how much it would bring on the open market alone in the cockpit of his scout ship jess shook his head what has happened to us if we can cheer because our losses were not too bad
