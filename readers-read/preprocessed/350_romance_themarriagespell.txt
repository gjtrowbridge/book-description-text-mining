 an excerpt from the marriage spell by mary jo putney ballantine june 2006 jack langdon lives in a regency world where magic is accepted but considered vulgar and undesirable by the ton jack met his best friends at a school designed to beat the magic out of aristocratic boys with too great an interest in wizardry twenty years later with magic far behind him jack has become an army officer fighting in the peninsular wars on leave back home he suffers mortal injuries in the hunting field his friends take him to abigail barton a talented healer and a young woman who has long admired him from afar abby turned to look at lord frayne lucky jack langdon he was called from what his friends said he would never have smiled at her on the streets of melton mowbray if hersquod known she was a wizard he probably would have spat and turned away yet the man still drew her both for her memories of him healthy and for his present vulnerability ldquoi want very much for him to liverdquo she said honestly ldquoit would be a tragedy for a strong young man who has such a gift for inspiring friendship to die needlessly buthellipi donrsquot know if i can do this would it be worth risking my life when i donrsquot know if there is a real chance of successrdquo she bit her lip ldquomy father would be most disappointed if his only daughter killed herself while attempting something beyond her abilitiesrdquo ldquois there anything that would make the risk worthwhile if you wish wealth or independencehelliprdquo ashbyrsquos voice trailed off suggestively abby studied fraynersquos unconscious form aching with frustration that his life was slipping away and she didnrsquot think she could save him it was absurd to be half in love with a man she didnrsquot even know an outrageous thought struck her more to herself than the men she murmured ldquothere is something that would make the risk worthwhile but itrsquos not a price lord frayne would be willing to payrdquo ldquosouls canrsquot be stolenrdquo ransom said ldquoanything else is open for discussionrdquo she laughed at the absurdity of her idea ldquoeven marriage i doubt he would do that even to save his liferdquo yet as she gazed at him she realized that she was willing to risk her life for no payment whatsoever simply because she wanted him to live irsquom sorry papa but i must do this to her shock ashby studied her through narrowed eyes ldquoask him he might surprise yourdquo her jaw dropped ldquoyou canrsquot be serious the idea is outrageousrdquo before she could say that she would attempt the healing circle without any extra incentives ashby said ldquoyou may be a wizard but you are also a lady so itrsquos not an unreasonable idea jack has said a couple of times that he really ought to be looking for a bride but he canrsquot face the horrors of the marriage mart what could be easier than a wife who can save his life and doesnrsquot need courtingrdquo taking abbyrsquos arm the duke guided her across the room to where lord frayne lay ldquojack we have a proposition for youhelliprdquo each time jack drifted into darkness he expected not to emerge from the shadows for they grew steadily darker more determined to suck him into ultimate blackness this time he was pulled back to awareness when ashby said ldquojack we have a proposition for you miss barton is a talented healer and she will undertake the risks of conducting a healing circle in return for the honor of becoming your wife it seems a fair bargain to me do you agreerdquo jack blinked wondering if he was out of his head ldquoare you insane rdquo he whispered his voice rasping ldquobetter dead than enthralled by a damned wyrdlingrdquo ashby leaned closer his green eyes fierce ldquothatrsquos the sort of thing one says when healthy would you really prefer death to marrying an attractive intelligent woman of good familyrdquo his friend had a point damn him now that death was rolling the dice with his bones jack realized that he wasnrsquot yet ready to make his final throw but marry a bloody female wyrdling he blinked fuzzily at the figure standing next to ashby female yes rather extravagantly so tall and robust and plain with brown hair and a square jaw not the sort of woman one would notice if passing in the street he supposed that men who liked amazons might find her attractive but jack had always had a fondness for petite ethereal blondes preferably blondes who didnrsquot dabble in even the smallest most acceptable forms of girlish magic and yet his life was in the balance he closed his eyes feeling too weak to make such a decision marriage he wouldnrsquot want to marry a woman who was a complete stranger even if she wasnrsquot a wyrdling granted ashby was generally a good judge of character but maybe his judgment was warped by the sight of jackrsquos dying carcass dying his body seemed to have disappeared except for the wretched struggle to draw breath he had seen enough men die in spain to recognize the signs of mortal injury bit by bit his life force was fading away he wasnrsquot ready yet dear god there were so many things he wanted to do places he wanted to visit friends he needed to see with sudden desperate ferocity he craved life like a man perishing in the desert craved water he opened his eyes and stared at the amazon ldquoif you try and half succeed would i be left a helpless cripple i truly would prefer death to thatrdquo she bent over him and suddenly she wasnrsquot an abstract idea but a real woman one with thoughts and feelings whose blue eyes became the whole world they were a pale blue with a dark navy blue edge magical eyes strange and compelling ldquothat will not happen lord frayne either you will survive and eventually heal or you will die you will not be left a broken man dependent on others i promise you thatrdquo as their gazes met he guessed that she understood his unspoken message if she couldnrsquot heal him she would let him go the knowledge was soothing but stillhellip ldquoyoursquore a wizard canrsquot marry a wizardrdquo he almost called her a wyrdling again but managed to change the word didnrsquot want to be rude ldquocome now jackrdquo ransom drawled from somewhere outside of the narrow range of jackrsquos vision ldquothink of how amusing it would be to horrify certain people by doing something so outrageousrdquo the faintest of trembles sounded in his voice ldquoyoursquove always rather liked being outrageousrdquo jack choked out a laugh leave it to ransom to make the idea of marrying a wizard sound like a delightful last way of thumbing his nose at society though the point of marrying this womanmdashmiss bartonmdashwas so that he wouldnrsquot be thumbing his nose for the last time he focused on the ladymdashwell ashby had implied that she was a lady and if her father was a baronet she probably wasmdashand asked ldquowhat kind of wife would you berdquo her dark brows drew together in a straight line as she considered ldquoan undemanding one i like life in the country so i wouldnrsquot come to london to embarrass you very oftenrdquo there was a faint ironic note in her velvety voice the fact of her magic repelled him and it would be a social embarrassment but at the moment neither of those facts were compelling ldquoyou propose to save my life how would you benefit from such a marriagerdquo ldquodoesnrsquot every woman wish to acquire a titlerdquo the irony thickened he would have smiled except that he didnrsquot have the strength ldquothatrsquos all you want a titlerdquo she glanced away ldquoihellipi would also like to have a childrdquo an awkward subject ldquothe wife of a peerrsquos first duty is to bear an heirrdquo he closed his eyes blocking out the sight of her he had never imagined that a day would come when he must be grateful to still have control of his eyelids he was dying and nothing would change that yet for a chance at life he would take the gamble despite the impossible odds ldquoif i survive a child might be managed god willing very well miss barton we have a bargain if you restore my life and health i give my word that you will be my briderdquo
