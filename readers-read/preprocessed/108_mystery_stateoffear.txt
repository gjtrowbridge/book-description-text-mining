 chapter excerpt paris nord sunday may 2 2004 1200 pm in the darkness he touched her arm and said stay here she did not move just waited the smell of salt water was strong she heard the faint gurgle of water then the lights came on reflecting off the surface of a large open tank perhaps fifty meters long and twenty meters wide it might have been an indoor swimming pool except for all the electronic equipment that surrounded it and the very strange device at the far end of the pool jonathan marshall came back to her grinning like an idiot questce que tu penses he said though he knew his pronunciation was terrible what do you think it is magnificent the girl said when she spoke english her accent sounded exotic in fact everything about her was exotic jonathan thought with her dark skin high cheekbones and black hair she might have been a model and she strutted like a model in her short skirt and spike heels she was half vietnamese and her name was marisa but no one else is here she said looking around no no he said its sunday no one is coming jonathan marshall was twentyfour a graduate student in physics from london working for the summer at the ultramodern laboratoire ondulatoirethe wave mechanics laboratoryof the french marine institute in vissy just north of paris but the suburb was mostly the residence of young families and it had been a lonely summer for marshall which was why he could not believe his good fortune at meeting this girl this extraordinarily beautiful and sexy girl show me what it does this machine marisa said her eyes were shining show me what it is you do my pleasure marshall said he moved to the large control panel and began to switch on the pumps and sensors the thirty panels of the wave machine at the far end of the tank clicked one after another he glanced back at her and she smiled at him it is so complicated she said she came and stood beside him at the control panel your research is recorded on cameras yes we have cameras in the ceiling and on the sides of the tank they make a visual record of the waves that are generated we also have pressure sensors in the tanks that record pressure parameters of the passing wave these cameras are on now no no he said we dont need them were not doing an experiment perhaps we are she said resting her hand on his shoulder her fingers were long and delicate she had beautiful fingers she watched for a minute then said this room everything is so expensive you must have great security no not really he said just cards to get in and only one security camera he gestured over his shoulder that one back in the corner she turned to look and that is turned on she said oh yes he said thats always on she slid her hand to caress his neck lightly so is someone watching us now afraid so then we should behave probably anyway what about your boyfriend him she gave a derisive snort i have had enough of him earlier that day marshall had gone from his small apartment to the caf233 on rue montaigne the caf233 he went to every morning taking a journal article with him to read as usual then this girl had sat down at the next table with her boyfriend the couple had promptly fallen into an argument in truth marshall felt that marisa and the boyfriend didnt seem to belong together he was american a beefy redfaced fellow built like a footballer with longish hair and wireframe glasses that did not suit his thick features he looked like a pig trying to appear scholarly his name was jim and he was angry with marisa apparently because she had spent the previous night away from him i dont know why you wont tell me where you were he kept repeating it is none of your business thats why but i thought we were going to have dinner together jimmy i told you we were not no you told me you were and i was waiting at the hotel for you all night so no one made you you could go out enjoy yourself but i was waiting for you jimmy you do not own me she was exasperated by him sighing throwing up her hands or slapping her bare knees her legs were crossed and the short skirt rode up high i do as i please thats clear yes she said and at that moment she turned to marshall and said what is that you are reading it looks very complicated at first marshall was alarmed she was clearly talking to him to taunt the boyfriend he did not want to be drawn into the couples dispute its physics he said briefly and turned slightly away he tried to ignore her beauty what kind of physics she persisted wave mechanics ocean waves so you are a student graduate student ah and clearly intelligent you are english why are you in france and before he knew it he was talking to her and she introduced the boyfriend who gave marshall a smirk and a limp handshake it was still very uncomfortable but the girl behaved as if it were not so you work around here what sort of work a tank with a machine really i cant imagine what you say will you show me and now they were here in the wave mechanics laboratory and jimmy the boyfriend was sulking in the parking lot outside smoking a cigarette what shall we do about jimmy she said standing beside marshall while he worked at the control panel he cant smoke in here i will see that he does not but i dont want to make him more angry
