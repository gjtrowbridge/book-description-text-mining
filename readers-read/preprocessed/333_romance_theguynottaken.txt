marlie davidow was not the kind of woman who went looking for trouble but one friday night in september thanks to her own curiosity and the wonders of the internet trouble found her her brother jason and his bridetobe were registered on weddingwishescom marlie housebound with a sixmonthold did all her shopping online sitting on the beige slipcovered couch where she spent most of her time nursing her baby or rocking her baby or trying to get her baby to stop crying so on that fateful friday night after zeke had finally succumbed to sleep she wiped the fermented pureed pears off her shirt set her laptop on the sofas arm and pointed and clicked her way through the purchase of a twohundreddollar knife set as she hit complete order she wondered about the propriety and potential bad mojo of sending the happy couple knives for their wedding too late she thought and rubbed her eyes it was nine oclock a time prebaby when a night might just be getting started but drew was still at work and she was as whipped as if shed run a marathon just for the hell of it marlie typed in her name and reviewed her own choices feeling wistful as she remembered compiling her wedding registry she and drew had made outings of it having leisurely brunches before driving out to the macys in the paramus mall to spend hours looking at china and crystal silver martini shakers and handblown margarita glasses from mexico two years and three months after their wedding the crystal and the silverware were still in their original boxes in her mothers basement awaiting the day when she and drew would move out of their onebedroom apartment on the upper east side and into a place with a dining room or at least a little more storage space the fancy china had been pulled out twice which corresponded to the number of homecooked meals marlie had made since shed left her job as publicity director for a small theater company in chelsea to stay home after zeke was born the telephone rang marlie picked it up and looked at the caller id webworx which meant drew who was probably calling to say hed be even later than usual she nudged the phone under a couch cushion and then prodded by an impulse she didnt pause to analyze turned back to her laptop typed the words bob morrison into the bridegroom blank and hit enter before she could lose her nerve nothing she thought as a little hourglass popped up on the screen over the last four years on and off shed looked for bob online idly typing his name into one search engine or another during down times at work she never found anything except the same stale handful of links bobs name listed as among the finishers in a 5k race hed run in college bob mentioned as one of the survivors in his grandfathers obituary bob and a bunch of other graduates of a summer art institute in long island besides if bob ever got married marlie figured shed feel it at some kind of organic cellular level after all the time theyd lived together not to mention all the times theyd slept together shed just know one couple matches your results popped onto the screen bob morrison and karen kravitz manhasset new york marlie jerked her head back from the computer as if a hand had reached out and slapped her bob morrison manhasset thats my bob she thought and then she shook her head sharply because bob wasnt hers anymore theyd broken up four years ago then shed met drew and now she was married she was mrs drew davidow mother of one and bob wasnt hers anymore click to view registry invited the text at the top of the page marlie clicked and scrolled through the registry her slack jaw and wide eyes bathed in the blue glow of the screen until her husband came home looking wan and weary and set his briefcase down next to the diaper bag are you okay he asked shed blinked at him groggily and started to climb off the couch the baby was crying again no dont worry i got it he managed a smile and headed toward the portionedoff part of their bedroom where zeke slept hey little man she heard him say she managed to get herself off the couch and staggered toward the bedroom ill just rest for a minute she thought as her head hit the pillow she closed her eyes and when she opened them again it was three in the morning drew was on the couch with zeke resting on his chest just starting to open his eyes marlie unfastened her nursing bra adjusted zekes weight in her arms and eventually the three of them fell asleep on the sofa together hes marrying a woman who registered for a healthometer food scale marlie reported to her best friend gwen on monday over an early lunch at their favorite midtown sushi place gwen whod been marlies friend in college and first roommate in new york had gotten married at twentyfive and pregnant at twentyseven and had gone back to work in advertising when her daughter started nursery school that day she wore highheeled boots fitted jeans and a smart tweed jacket with ruffled cuffs complemented by a gorgeous red patentleather bag marlie carried a nylon diaper bag and wore maternity jeans shed never been a skinny girl to start with and she was having trouble shedding the last fifteen eighteen actually pounds of baby weight which seemed to have settled themselves quite happily on her hips gwen raised her eyebrows and we know this because marlie gave her the condensed version of the story while pushing zekes stroller back and forth with her sneakered foot shed been buying her brother a present just decided to plug in bobs name gwens saucershaped hazel eyes widened but her voice was calm as she said just decided to marlies cheeks flushed well i was curious i guess and thats not the point the point is that hes marrying the unme the antime she pushed the stroller so hard that it bumped into the table spilling green tea onto gwens plate and into her lap oh god im sorry no worries gwen said too quickly as she tried to mop up the mess while keeping her cuffs dry its just tea so the unme thing youre basing it just on the food scale what kind of woman registers for a food scale marlie asked a woman whos concerned about portion size i guess a skinny bitch marlie muttered handing her friend her napkin and if youre the person who gives them the food scale what do you say on the card best wishes for a happy life together ps dont get fat you could just go with congratulations gwen said it wasnt just the food scale said marlie there was a plastic chipanddip set tackay and beige china beige she shook her head feeling her heart pounding realizing she was angrier about this than shed previously suspected beige boring yeah she thought bitterly like she was leading such an exciting life her idea of culture these days was watching more than twenty minutes of uninterrupted oprah gwen set her chopsticks down okay listen to me we are not going down the bob morrison road again what are you talking about the obsession the agonizing the dialing while drunk i only did that once marlie protested gwens cuffs were dripping marlie pulled a pamper out of her diaper bag and handed it to her friend the drivebys gwen continued relentlessly pointing a chopstick for emphasis it cant technically be a driveby if you walk marlie said and listen gwen what if he was the one i was supposed to be with what if she took a bite of dynamite roll poured more tea and popped a few edamame our of their shells when she looked up gwen was still waiting head tilted eyes wide she sighed and said reluctantly what if he was the one gwen looked taken aback as if shed never questioned her commitment to her own husband she probably hadnt marlie thought it was probably easy not to when your husband was tall handsome completely agreeable besotted with you and looked like a taller notcrazy tom cruise well for starters you married someone else and had a baby with him gwen said marlie sighed there was that gwen set her chopsticks down on her plate and looked at her friend intently marlie she said this is what you wanted you wanted drew you wanted a baby you wanted to stop working remember marlie nodded she could remember all too vividly sitting across from her friend in this very restaurant bouncing gwens daughter ginger on her knee and avowing her desire for those very things but ginger had been an adorably pudgy baby whod grown into an adorable little girl with a collection of little mermaid purses and afterschool ballet lessons and gwen with her clean house and her nanny and her happy accommodating husband made it all look easy had gwens first six months of motherhood been this awful if they were marlie wondered would her friend have told her i know things arent great right now gwen said marriages go through rough times did yours she asked gwen shrugged well sure remember that fight we had about whether to take his mom on vacation with us marlie nodded even though as best as she could remember that fight had ended after a day when paul had simply agreed to tack on the cost of another casita to their stay in scottsdale as for marlie she had thought once or twice late at night when she was so tired it was a struggle to get her limbs to obey her that recent events in her marriage had transcended the boundaries of rough time and were edging toward the whole thing was a mistake drew and his partners were in the process of launching webworx her husband left their apartment before eight in the morning and rarely got home before nine oclock at night and she couldnt fairly complain about it because he was the only one bringing home a paycheck shed just never expected that caring for a newborn would leave her feeling so exhausted so edgy and desperate for adult human contact beyond the ten minutes of conversation drew could muster before falling asleep when he finally came home its going to get better gwen said she glanced at her slim gold watch smoothed her straightened hair and got to her feet i know this parts hard but trust me you just have to live through it zekes going to start walking and talking and sleeping and youll be fine she looked down fondly at zeke and bent to kiss his cheek and believe me you wouldnt have wanted to miss this it goes so fast marlie nodded feeling a jealousy toward her friend that was so strong and sudden that it was like being punched shed have given anything to be gwen with ruffled cuffs and beautiful boots on her way off to an afternoon that would not include endless renditions of the itsybitsy spider and three baskets of spitup stiffened laundry an evening that would not involve a baby who screamed and screamed no matter how she tried to soothe him she meant to walk home but zeke was still sleeping peacefully in his stroller and somehow she found herself walking downtown past the bus stop and the trash cans the grocery store and the fancy boutiques toward the neighborhood where she and bob had once lived together hey bob meet marlie hah hah hah marlie said holding her plastic cup of beer and looking up at the man whod just occasioned a joke shed heard approximately a thousand times in her life once for every bob shed ever met but this bob didnt seem so bad he was broadshouldered maybe an inch or two taller than she was with curling brown hair and goldrimmed glasses a soft belly pushing against the buttons of his blueandgreenplaid shirt and a friendly slanting smile he looked like an illustration of a friendly bear cub from one of the books shed loved as a little girl is it marley like the singer or no its marlie with an i and an e oh bob nodded leaning close so she could hear him over the sound of rem informing the assembled guests in the crowded offcampus apartment that it was the end of the world as they knew it wanna dance she shook her head she didnt dance girls like gwen cute girls graceful girls they danced girls like marlie stood in the corner making caustic comments and guarding her friends purses no thank you she said but bob either didnt hear or didnt care because he plucked her cup of beer out of her hand and pulled her toward the center of the room no really she tried again but bob wasnt listening he smiled and reached for her putting one hand on the small of her back tucking her neatly against him come on he said his skin was pleasantly warm and he smelled of soap and beer and something sweet like hay or freshcut grass even through the bass line she imagined she could hear the beating of his heart bob and marlie stayed together until they graduated from nyu and then they moved into a place that marlie had found in murray hill marlie whod starred in every campus theater group production from medea to hair did temp work in law offices and went on auditions and gosees trying out for everything from soap operas to experimental offbroadway productions to madeforcable shootemups bob talked about graduate school and painted his big colorful abstract canvases a few hours a day a few days a week bob had a trust fund thanks to a father whod done quite well as a personal injury attorney one big case involving a guy whod lost both legs in a freak subway mishap and hed been set for life so it didnt really matter if bob never got a gallery to represent him or a day job or if he never finished the paintings he started or if he spent most of his time making mix tapes and meeting his similarly semiemployed friends for lunches that turned into marathon frisbee games in union square park marlie watched and waited and went everywhere her agent sent her it took her a few years to figure out gradually and painfully that she was a good actress and new york city only had room for the great ones and sometimes not even them shed get the occasional callback for tv shows that filmed in new york the everysooften bit part and once a commercial for an antacid in which she portrayed bloating sufferer number three and clutched at her belly convincingly for fourteen hours she and bob turned twentythree then twentyfour still in their little apartment with the kitchen full of newspapers and pizza boxes bob could never remember to recycle and the bed well futon really that never got made where everything they owned had been scavenged from a street corner or donated by bobs parents two weeks after bobs twentyfifth birthday they had a talk that boiled down to marlie asking is this all you want from your life and bob responding yeah and i dont see whats wrong with it hed sulked shed fumed and gone to sleep on the couch two weeks later she told her agent not to bother submitting her head shot anymore took the fulltime publicity job at new directions theater at 8th avenue and 18th street and moved out i have put away childish things she thought as bob leaned against the doorway giving her the boxes shed packed and wiping at his eyes be good hed said handing her a ninebynine square wrapped in plain brown paper a portrait hed painted of her back when they were still in college grow up she thought kissing his stubbly salty cheek and then walking down the rickety stairs with the scuffed rubber treads past the hole that some new tenants kingsize bed had gouged out of the plaster wall and except for one rumsoaked weekend involving a few latenight phone calls and three trips past their old apartment that had been that shed met drew the following summer on a vacation gwen had talked her into a long weekend whitewater rafting in west virginia in the gear shop being fitted for her wetsuit and paddle shed mistaken her future husband for one of the guides shed peppered him with half a dozen questions about the equipment and whether anyone ever got hurt on these trips before he confessed that he was actually a web designer from manhattan whod been born and bred in the city and didnt know any more about rafting than she did when it turned out they both worked in chelsea theyd exchanged business cards and when they got home theyd traded emails then theyd met for drinks then theyd started going out shed married drew and bob she knew from a postcard hed sent a year and a half ago had found a gallery in the village to represent him bob morrison unfinished his show was called shed wondered if it was meant to be a joke then shed wondered if he actually wanted her to come to the opening or if hed sent the card as a kind of screwyou a way of thumbing his nose at her and showing her hed made it as an artist after all eventually shed stopped wondering and tossed the card thinking that things had worked out the way they were supposed to happy endings all around everyone where and with whom they were supposed to be so why now all these years later with a husband and a baby couldnt she quit thinking about bob morrison why couldnt she stop remembering the night theyd met how cool the spring air had been on her face when shed left the party how the night had smelled of lilacs how bob had eased her against the stairwell of that longago apartment raining kisses down on her face as his hand had slid up her cheap cotton skirt you have to stop this she told herself pushing the stroller back toward carl schurz park shed made her choice shed picked what was behind door number two and it wouldnt do her any good to think about what might have been behind door number one at the park she fed zeke then smeared sunblock on his plump white arms and cheeks an hour passed with excruciating slowness while she pushed her baby in a swing and listened to the other mommies trying to nod in the right places trying to impersonate a happily married young mother whod made the right decisions and was reasonably content with her life but that night drew was working late again and after shed wiped down the countertops and sponged dried oatmeal from zekes breakfast off the floor marlie found herself back on weddingwishescom rolling her eyes over bob and karens towels and polyesterblend tablecloths before long not even that was enough and some dark impulse led her to stick one of bobs old mix tapes into the stereo and click back to the login page if you are the bride or groom click here she read as the cures why cant i be you jangled in the background she clicked on groom please enter your password she held her breath and typed the whole time shed known him bobs password had always been felicity which was the name of his cat verifying then welcome bob click here to update registry read the screen her heart was pounding as she scrolled through household items to find just the thing she wanted adding it to the list hitting update one hitachi magic wand with its wonderfully suggestive shape added to the morrisonkravitz wishlist heh but why stop with sex toys update brides contact information invited a link marlie clicked and there were the address and phone number for karen kravitz little miss help me celebrate my new life with a food scale marlie cut and pasted karens information into a new window for future research purposes maybe shed forward it to gwen who was a whiz on the internet maybe gwen would get lucky and find a picture her fingers froze above the keyboard as another idea occurred to her quickly before she could lose her nerve she erased karen kravitzs name and typed in her own update the screen asked this is crazy marlie thought but the knowledge of her own insanity didnt stop her maybe once she saw her name and bobs together at the top of a wedding registry that now included a food scale beige china and a vibrator the obsession that had taken hold of her since shed learned that bob was getting married would loosen its grip and shed be herself again and happy she hit enter there was a popping noise as small and unimportant as a soap bubble burstingand her screen went black oh no she murmured giving the laptop a little shake she hit controlaltdelete nothing happened she hit restart still nothing no no no she groaned yanking out the power cord and plugging it in again what if shed broken the computer and what was going to happen when bob saw what shed done to his registry she heard zeke make his little crowing eh eh eh noise in the bedroom she ran into the bedroom pulled him out of his crib with shaking hands changed his diaper nursed him on the couch next to the blackscreened laptop while frantically trying to restart the computer with her free hand and figure out how to tell drew what had happened shed gotten as far as honey im really sorry when she fell asleep marlie the instant she opened her eyes she knew something was wrong the light the light was wrong there was too much of it in his entire life zeke had never slept past six in the morning and the room was too full of light for it to be that early the light was wrong the bed felt wrong and that voice marlie rolled over and felt her whole body break out in goose bumps when she saw who was lying next to her bob bob morrison with new wrinkles at the corners of his brown eyes looking at her with his familiar slanting smile she sat straight up in the bed the futon barely managing to bite back a scream you okay babe the sunlight glinted off the silver threads in his hair and his hand was warm on her bare shoulder youre not getting cold feet or anything right right she managed her heart was in her throat and she could feel her pulse booming in her ears as she slipped one hand underneath her pajama bottoms feeling for the line of raised flesh no scar hence no csection ditto no eighteen pounds of baby weight and presumably no baby this is a dream she thought running her hands over her hips and wondering why she had ever thought she was fat before shed had the baby or if shed ever had a dream that felt this real everything was so vivid the feel of the sheets on her bare skin the faint smell of beeswax candles the sound of traffic through the windows even the sour justwokeup taste in her mouth bobs hand followed marlies under her waistband he leaned close and kissed her cheek then her ear marlie shuddered as his beard scraped the tender skin of her neck feeling a flush of pleasure which was quickly followed by a fullon wave of guilt bathroom she gasped she tossed back the covers and hopped out of bed skidding through a patch of sunlight and stopped to twirl in front of the bathroom mirror checking out her prebaby physique from all possible angles okay she whispered in the mirror focus it was a dream brought on by the mishap with the registry and possibly bad sushi hadnt she thought the toro had tasted iffy and even though she could smell the toothpaste and the soap could feel the slightly damp bath mat under her feet could hear bob padding across the floor to come find her maybe hoping for a quickie in the shower before she headed off to work and he headed off to wherever it wasnt real so it wasnt cheating he eased the door open and looked at her with a familiar gleam in his eyes good morning sunshine she grinned at him when she was pregnant shed had the most outrageous xrated dreams and one of them had started off sort of like this and had eventually wound up including every guy on laguna beach he backed her up against the vanity and kissed her once and not for long then he reached for his toothbrush i need to get out of here oh this was a dream she reminded herself he probably just had to go downstairs where stephen talen and jason were waiting wearing nothing more than their swimsuits and their smiles where bob stared at her to work he said speaking slowly as if marlie had become deaf overnight are you sure youre okay marlie nodded looking at her hands the left one sported an engagement ring it was a perfectly nice diamond ring just not hers bob leaned close and kissed her again tonight he said his voice low and husky ill make it up to you have a good day he smiled and went to the closet where he started getting dressed have a good massage what asked marlie then dont i need to go to work he was looking at her strangely again you took the day off my mother got you that gift certificate at bliss remember oh right she said she nodded he nodded reassured picked up his coat and walked out the door marlie hugged herself and grinned skipped back to the bedroom and flopped onto the down comforter that was still warm from bobs body feeling joy flood through her freedom she thought in the manner of mel gibson rallying the scots in braveheart freeeeeedom and a massage too what an excellent dream this was turning out to be marlie spent the afternoon in babyfree bliss skipping down to the newsstand at the corner where the guy behind the counter remembered her name and handed her us star and people in a big slippery stack having a grilled threecheese sandwich for lunch in the window of her favorite coffee shop savoring every exquisite silent moment of her massage afterwards marlie took a taxi back to their old apartment where she wandered barefoot through the small rooms admiring her rubyred toenails and noticing that the dreambob bob 20 was still in the habit of leaving halffinished cups of coffee on the radiator but there werent any canvases unfinished or not propped against the walls no paintbrushes or paint anywhere either no smell of linseed oil or turpentine weird marlie thought as she opened the closet trying to see if there were any unstretched canvases in there no luckbut when she slipped her fingers into the pockets of bobs winter coat she found a business card robert morrison it read director of innovation and new technology morrison law llp so bob had broken down and gone to work for his father as director of innovation and new technology whatever that was it gave her a strange sad pang just for the heck of it she dialed her own number at new directions instead of her own voice cheerful and confident saying this is marlie davidow at new directions theater there was threetoned chime then a mechanical voice you have reached a nonworking number if you feel you have reached this recording in error now she felt even sadder and stranger was new directions still mounting uncommon women and others who was making followup calls to the citys jaded cynical theater critics convincing them that the play wasnt just a throwback gloss on sex and the city because it involved more than one woman and how long had she been asleep anyhow she wondered whether zeke was sleeping too or whether hed woken up and drew was with him she tentatively pinched her right armthen wincing pinched it harder nothing happened the logical thing to do would be to fall asleep again and hope that shed wake up in the right bed or at least on the couch in the right apartment but after the first good nights sleep shed had in months dozing off seemed unlikely marlie forced herself to think calmly if this was a dream she could wake up if it was some kind of alternate reality a glitch in the timespace continuum that had nothing to do with bad sushi and was possibly related to actual magic she could figure that out too she stood in the center of the room closed her eyes and clicked her freshly pumiced heels together theres no place like home she said she opened her eyes nope still bobs apartment she shut her eyes again its a wonderful life she opened her eyes no dice heart racing mouth dry marlie scanned the room looking for clues bobs dirty clothes on the floorlast sundays newspaper ditto her hands clenched into fists as she stared at the artworkfree wall taking a deep breath she started walking toward itthen trotting shed worked herself up to a halfdecent jog when her forehead made contact ow shit marlie reeled back blinking her eyes were watering and she saw stars but beyond the stars she could see that she was still emphatically not back home again then it hit her she wiped her eyes and ran to bobs laptop drumming her fingers on the desk and muttering come on come on as the cranky dialup connection stuttered its way online hello bob and marlie read the login screen at wedding wishescom she clicked on the brides information tab the screen froze system error it read windows will shut down no no no she hissed but the connection was broken and she heard bobs feet making their way up the scarred staircase and his key in the lock hey bob called said coming through the door with a garment bag in one hand and a shoe box in the other he frowned when he saw that she was barefoot in her jeans wed better get going cant be late to our own party right here comes the bride bobs brother randall called from the doorway of the bar two blocks from their apartment where bob and marlie were regulars not because theyd ever liked the place the bartender was surly and the jukebox ate their change but because it had twodollar pitchers on monday nights which made it an affordable option for bobs slacker friends marlie winced as randall enfolded her in a rough hug randall had grabbed her boob in the morrison family dining room after thanksgiving dinner one year and then tried to explain away the gesture as the consequence of overwork and the tryptophan in the turkey while marlie had stood there face flaming afraid to move lest she bump into one of the many morrison antiques she looked over her shoulder for her putative husbandtobe but bob had vanished he always does this she remembered feeling the old frustration wash over her classic bob hed take her to a family function promise to stay by her side because he knew that she was shy and that his brother was a boobgrabber and when shed turn around hed be two rooms away watching the football game drew would never she thought drew could be loud he was frequently late he was deeply opinionated and he was not shy about sharing his beliefs with friends and even less so with strangers but at parties he would take her coat and hold her hand hed stick to her side making sure that her glass was full and that she was part of a conversation marlie shook her head feeling the afternoons unease ramping up toward panic what if she was really still asleep on the couch and the baby was awake and she didnt hear him not likely she knew but every once in a while zeke woke up and didnt cry shed walk into the bedroom and find him lying in his crib staring up at her calmly with his bluegray eyes like he was waiting for her to tell him a story the crowd swept her toward the buffet set up on tables along the back wall per usual at morrison family affairs there was a surplus of booze and very little food bobs parents were standing by the bar looking prim and out of place mr morrison in a sports jacket and mrs morrison in twohundreddollar yoga pants and a beaded peasant blouse the likes of which no real peasant could hope to afford bob brushed past her deep in conversation with someone marlie didnt recognize marlie grabbed his sleeve and he gave her a nonchalant smile come meet my friends he said he steered her toward the jukebox where she was introduced to barb and barry from ultimate frisbee and karen from morrison law karen kravitz the woman looked startled thats right she was of medium height and medium build in a paleblue jacket and a pair of unfortunate highwaisted blue jeans her hair was light brown but her eyebrows and eyelashes were so pale and wispy they were practically invisible have we met so this is who bob marries in real life marlie thought just an ordinary person with a taste for beige china and a skewer of what appeared to be chicken satay in one hand hey marlie said unable to help herself would you say youve got about four ounces there karen kravitz blinked her seethrough lashes excuse me nothing marlie saidand then thank god she spotted someone she knew gwen she shimmied and twisted through the crowd and flung her arms around her friends neck when she let go gwen was looking at her quizzically jeez marlie i just saw you last night for sushi marlie asked for your fitting gwen said looking at her strangely come with me marlie dragged her friend to the bathroom which was small and dirty with greenpainted walls and the aggressive reek of ammonia i need to tell you something she ran her hands through her hair the glossy goodsmelling hairdo of a woman with time on her hands and no baby in her life i know its going to sound crazy but im not supposed to be here are you having second thoughts gwen asked with an eagerness that would have been insulting under other circumstances her eyes sparkled as she reached into her purse in this life a luscious black crocodile hobo bag for her keys my cars right outside i can have you out of here in five minutes flat i dont need a car i need a computer i have to change my wedding registry gwen stared at her eyes wide mouth open youre having second thoughts about your china havent you already gotten four place settings already its not the china my life im having second thoughts about my life gwen stared at her mouth open eyes wide drew marlie continued frantically drew davidow thats my husband thats who im supposed to marry we met him on that rafting trip remember now gwen looked troubled marlie weve never been on a rafting trip there was a knock on the door ladies bob called marlie tried one last time i have a baby a little baby boy ezekiel zeke we named him after my grandfather she reached into her own purse fumbling for the wallet and the picture she kept there of zeke when he was one day old swaddled in the pinkandbluestriped hospital blanket with a little knitted cap on his head but the wallet she found wasnt the wallet she remembered and when she flipped it open the only picture she found was one of her and bob from a photo booth at dave busters sticking their tongues out at the camera is this some kind of joke gwen asked marlie dropped the wallet and grabbed her friends hands help me help me please she said her voice beseeching im not supposed to be here bob stepped through the door looking impatient there you are he said edging past gwen he took marlie by the hand and led her past the dripping sink and the broken paper towel dispenser back out into the party as gwen shot one last troubled look over her shoulder and left marlie hoped to get the laptop that would be her salvation and send her home this is a mistake marlie thought smiling mechanically as she hugged bobs aunt phyllis who smelled of the altoids she chewed compulsively to mask the scent of the cigarettes she thought nobody knew she smoked ive got to get out of here she thought as randall congratulated her again allowing his hands to drift from her waist to the curve of her ass here own mother kissed her cheek and whispered good luck marlie swallowed hard almost crying remembering how her mother had said im so happy for you the night before shed married drew the night unfolded in a parade of ribald toasts and congratulations and finally marlie decided that if she couldnt wake up and she couldnt get home she could at least enjoy one pleasure denied to breastfeeding mothers and get really really drunk she started with a beer then moved to her old singlegirl standard rum and diet coke the jukebox blared mustang sally and bobs frisbee friends clustered around a television set at one end of the bar marlie set down her third sweating glass on a tray full of empty plates and dirty napkins and made her way to the bar for a refill while she waited another way to fix things surfaced slowly in her rumsodden brain sleeping beauty she thought heelclicking and headbashing hadnt worked maybe all she really needed to do was get karen to give bob a kiss it was she decided worth a try she collected her drink smoothed her hair and sidled over to karen kravitz who was standing in a corner with a wistful look on her face hey marlie said and burped the other woman gave her a weak smile so listen marlie said do you um like bob sure karen said her tone was neutral hes very nice youre very lucky i mean do you like him marlie said and gave karens forearm an encouraging little squeeze the other womans eyes widened what are you saying she stammered marlie hiccupped and silently cursed her decision to go with a carbonated alcohol delivery device nothing never mind do you like art she asked yknow bobs quite the artist i know karen said warily he does a comic strip about the office does he okay this was good this was something are you in it the other woman smiled sometimes its more about bob and his father her smile widened in the comic strip bob gets superpowers after a freak accident where lightning hits one of the vending machines in the snack room lightning marlie marveled snack room wow ill bet the drawings are really good karens eyes narrowed hes never shown it to you marlie ignored the question he used to be a painter in college and after that was what he really wanted but its hard you know okay she thought bring it on home i think she blared oops too loud she lowered her voice i think its so important for women to be nurturing and encouraging to be you know the power behind the throne or the easel karen gave her a strange look excuse me she said and disappeared into the crowd marlie sighed and slumped down at a table for two when she looked up the other woman was standing there with a steaming mug of coffee in her hands here you go she said not unkindly it was nice to meet you see you sunday bobs a really good kisser marlie called helplessly toward karens departing back no answer no surprise marlie hiccupped again realizing miserably that her theoretical husbands actual fianc233e might very well have thought she was proposing a prenuptial threesome she sighed catching sight of bobs familiar figure the line of his shoulders and his worn plaid shirt as he stood shoulder to shoulder with three of his cousins at the bar she remembered something shed forgotten in the excitement the obsession really of stumbling across the news of bobs nuptials four months before theyd broken up she and bob had a fight at her grandmothers eightieth birthday party marlies grandmother always had something to say about marlies job prospects or her appearance and marlie was delighted that for once shed have a supportive boyfriend by her side bob however had other ideas and jets tickets he finally agreed to skip the game and go to the party but hed sulked for the entire ride up to rhinebeck and hed ducked out of the living room after two beers and twenty minutes leaving marlie to parry her grandmothers increasingly pointed questions about whether she and her young man had made any plans she found bob in his car slouched behind the wheel with the radio tuned to the game a third and fourth beer in the cupholders and a truculent look on his face hey little help in there she said bob reached down and turned up the volume without looking at her when did you decide to hate me so much she asked him shed started the question lightly as if she were teasing but by the end of it she wasnt kidding at all bob gave her a hostile shrug marlie was pierced with the knowledge of how far apart theyd drifted he didnt want to be in her grandmothers house with her and she didnt want to be in the stadium with him he might have cared for her might have even loved her but he didnt or couldnt take care of her and she fed up with the joblessness and the aimlessness the frisbee games and the parental handouts and the halffinished paintings was increasingly disinclined to take care of him the relationship didnt officially end for months but she knew that that was the real moment when it had died she and bob walked home from the bar in silence are you okay he asked tossing his keys onto the rickety table by the door seeming not to notice as they bounced off the surface and slid to the floor she nodded woodenly when the nurse had handed zeke to her for the first time in the hospital shed said here you go mom and marlie had actually turned to look over her shoulder to see if her own mother was there im not sure i can do this shed told drew and hed leaned down eyes tender and kissed her forehead and said i know you can she remembered the three of them in the taxi home the brandnew car seat painstakingly strapped between them and one of zekes hands gripping her index finger and she thought of drew in the equipment shop as hed zipped up her wetsuit and adjusted her grip on the paddle telling her not to worry because he was pretty sure the rapids looked worse than they were late into that sleepless night in the white cotton nightgown shed lost in the move out of their old apartment and thought shed never see again she lay beside a man who wasnt her husband at least not yet and with any luck not ever and thought about drew and her baby she conjured their faces until she could practically touch them could practically reach out and kiss them she could see zekes fingers fanning open and shut as he nursed the way drews hair curled over his collar when he went too long between haircuts this is what you wanted gwen had said marlie opened her eyes and looked down into bob morrisons slack sleeping face then she touched his arm bob woke up with a start eyes wide face flushed huh she propped herself up on her elbow and looked down at him im sorry she said he squinted at her in the darkness why whatd you do it doesnt matter you just have to forgive me because you work for your father instead of painting she thought because youre supposed to be karens husband not mine fine i forgive you can i go back to sleep she nodded and she kissed his cheek he ruffled her hair and rolled over a minute later he was snoring again she counted to a hundred once then again and when the world was dark and still outside and the city streets were quiet she tiptoed back to bobs computer and logged on to weddingwishescom her hands trembled as she clicked over to change grooms information erased bob and typed in drew update the screen inquired her fingers paused curled over the keys now she thought now im going to type zeke is the happiest baby ever born and he sleeps fourteen hours every night and never cries or drew davidow is home from work by six oclock but she didnt type anything else she hit enter and closed her eyes and crossed her fingers nothing happened for a minute then the words thank you marlie floated onto the screen she went back to bed and lay down next to bob with his easy smile and warm hands and his smell of freshcut grass for the last time knowing in her heart that shed wake up where she was supposed to be curled on the couch with her son safe in his crib and her csection scar and eighteen extra pounds back where they were supposed to be and her husband would be coming through the door smiling his tired smile lifting her to her feet and leading her back toward the bed they shared telling her go to sleep ive got this
