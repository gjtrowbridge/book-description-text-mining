 chapter one it was jemma who called melanie to say she couldnt awaken her parents that sunday morning jemma who had lived with the hammond family for the first twenty years of her employ and for the last twenty loyally took the train up from the bronx every morning and then a cab to their house in purchase new york she did this every morning save an occasional saturday and sunday when there was a church function or one of her friends or neighbors needed her assistance but what with the snowstorm she decided to check when the hammonds hadnt answered their phone besides jemma thought it was about time she pulled up the artificial tree from the basement and started decorating the girls were coming for christmas this year and that was only the day after tomorrow the girls jemma thought grace and melanie were women now with children of their own but to her they would always be the girls jemma knew the moment she stepped out of the cab that the hammonds house was too quiet two newspapers wrapped in plastic were jammed into the newspaper box the blinds in the upstairs bedroom window were still drawn the lamp did not glow from the living room on that pale gray day at first jemma hoped it was the soporific hush that snowfall causes on a lazy sunday morning and that the hammonds were uncharacteristically sleeping she turned her key in the door and flipped on the light in the vestibule she called out their names and poked her head into the living room and saw it was indeed darkened and untouched usually jemma found them sitting side by side in the living room wearing dark plaid flannel robes in winter and whitepiped pastel cotton robes in summer they would say good morning and make small talk about the weather remind her of a task that needed to be done that jemma knew to do anyway after forty years jemma would roll up the blinds and open a window if the weather was temperate she would place mrs hammonds copper kettle on for tea and lay out her place setting at the dining table with a crystal bowl of sugar cubes a china teacup matching plate of wheat toast and a small jar of marmalade with a tiny gold spoon lately she put the newspapers television guide next to mrs hammonds place setting and circled the movies and quiz shows in red she would right mr hammonds tv tray in front of the television a bowl of wheatena a glass of tomato juice a cup of sanka with saccharine that he shook from a small silver envelope he ate in silence watching the dowjones trail monotonously at the bottom of the screen there was no conversation at breakfast ultimately mrs hammond would take her place next to her husband on the sofa they would watch the game shows and wait for lunch sometimes they played gin rummy or scrabble but mr hammond had trouble with games lately he had difficulty distinguishing the suits when he played gin rummy with his wife he became confused with clubs and spades hearts and diamonds the shapes and the colors baffled him scrabble was even more daunting there were too many words he couldnt remember he stared at the jumbled letter tiles in the rack before him pushing them about with his finger and shaking his head from side to side stuck on the words when the girls were children jemma often carried mrs hammonds breakfast to her room quotyour mama has a weak constitutionquot jemma would explain as grace and melanie sat at the kitchen table eating their breakfast while their father hid behind the herald tribune drinking his sanka quotshe needs her sugar in the morning now you girls eat and ill be right back to get you on that bus quotit was easy for grace and melanie to believe jemma how could you not believe someone who wore shirtwaist dresses with gingham checks whose lips were polished with an amber gloss that looked like it might taste like apricot sometimes jemma even painted her nails as well a deep burgundy and if the girls happened to be around when jemma was doing what she called her beauty routine shed paint their nails as well jemma would sit the girls down at the kitchen table their fingers dangling in bowls of soapy water shed push back their cuticles with an orange stick and file the tips into ovals this is just like the salon jemma would say with the emphasis on salons first syllable and the girls would laugh and say that they felt fancy once in a while their father would lower the paper that covered his face at breakfast and say something to his daughters something like quothow are you girls this morningquot or quotmake sure you kiss your mother goodbyequot he tried at the very least for the pretense of intimacy of family awkwardly but he tried though he was visibly uncomfortable in his own skin unable to extend even the smallest offering of warmth as though it might scald him or perhaps scald those around him jemma walked hesitantly up the stairs that early sunday morning she walked slowly not with the surprisingly brisk pace with which her sixtyfouryearold legs usually carried her she opened the hammonds bedroom door tentatively with a stillgloved hand and knew from the moment she saw them side by side motionless and emotionless that they were gone she let go a cry and ran back down the stairs the heel of her boot snagged on a piece of loose carpet causing her to trip and she righted herself with the aid of the banister her hands trembled so rapidly she could barely dial melanies number it never occurred to her to call the police and still not believing what she saw jemma told melanie she was unable to awaken her parents melanie and her husband drove the twenty minutes from where they lived leaving their threeyearold twin boys in the care of a neighbor who as melanie always said was like a grandmother to them when melanie and mike arrived at the house that sunday morning after jemma called they parked their car behind the old black buick in the driveway it was apparent that the car had not been used in days the roof was covered with a crusty layer of snow the windows were iced over jemma was standing just inside the open front door the pewter chandelier in the entryway shone dimly several of the candle bulbs had burned out making the old goldcolored grass cloth on the walls appear even dingier jemmas purpleandred paisley scarf was tied under her chin her dull red parka buttoned up to her neck she clutched her pocketbook as though at any moment she was prepared to leave powdered snow had blown into the entrance hall and dusted the tops of her boots as melanie and mike approached her jemma stepped outside onto the stoop quotjemma you must be freezing standing here with the door open like thisquot melanie said hugging her gently as if she might break quoti dont want to go back inside maybe we shouldnt go insidequot jemma said her eyes darting one way and then the other quotmaybe we should just let them sleepquot quotits okay jemmaquot mike said glancing nervously at his wife quotwere here nowquot melanie ushered jemma back into the house and closed the heavy front door behind them she started to call out hello and stopped choking on the first syllable before the word could be completed despite jemmas insistence that her parents were merely sleeping melanie knew there would be no answer she knew when jemma called that there would be no awakening melanie placed her coat over the banister glanced at her fathers old brown fedora hanging on the hook beside the mirror she saw her mothers trench coat hanging next to her fathers hat her threadbare beige cashmere scarf tucked into the sleeve the fringe dangling through the cuff she turned the corner and stopped before the arched living room door jemma followed by melanies side gripping melanies elbow tightly while mike trailed a few steps behind them quotare they in their bedroomquot melanie turned suddenly to jemma asking what she already knew quotthey are i cant wake themquot she repeated jemmas face appeared frozen she appeared to mouth the words almost grotesquely in slow motion when she spoke melanie looked at jemma intently she saw the coarse curls of gray that sprouted around her temples the dark circles beneath her eyes that were prematurely rheumy with age melanie took jemmas hands in hers and saw the darkened age spots and reddened thickening around her knuckles as jemmas hands slowly closed upon her own in what she perceived as both a gesture of desperation and confidence for a moment melanie pictured jemmas fineboned face as a young woman her creamy mocha skin her once jetblack hair sleeked into a bun at the nape of her neck her delicate fingers that nimbly threaded needles sewed on buttons hemmed skirts braided hair quotits going to be okay jemmaquot melanie said in a way that begged for jemmas assurance but jemma only blinked back tears quotmel maybe you and jemma should wait in the car and let me quot mike said but melanie clearly didnt hear him and he stopped speaking halfway through his sentence melanie started up the stairs stopped halfway and came back down she picked up the phone on the table by the stairwell quotmelanie who are you callingquot asked jemma quotthe policequot melanie said quotbut whyquot jemma almost pleaded quotwhy should you quot melanie interrupted her as the police answered quotwe have a problem at thirtytwo harvest lanequot she said quotcan you send a carquot quotwhat seems to be the problemquot the voice asked on the other end quoti think my parents might be deadquot said melanie jemma gasped covering her mouth with her hand quotmelaniequot she cried quotmelanie all i said was i couldnt wake themquot quotjesus melquot mike said quotjesus its all right jemmaquot his arm was slung around jemmas shoulder now enveloping her quottheir um housekeeper found them this morningquot melanie continued raising her hand wrist bent back fingers spread tensely to silence her husband and jemma as she spoke quotshe says she couldnt wake them upquot and then quotno i havent seen them yet yes the house is intact no my husband is with us there is no evidence of a breakin yes well wait outsidequot
