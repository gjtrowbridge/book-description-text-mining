 chapter one when we left egypt in the spring of 1907 i felt like a defeated general who has retreated to lick his wounds if i may be permitted a somewhat inelegant but expressive metaphor our archaeological season had experienced the usual ups and downs kidnapping murderous attacks and the like to which i was well accustomed but that year disasters of an unprecented scope had befallen us the worst was the death of our dear old friend abdullah who had been foreman of our excavations for many years he had died as he would have wished in a glorious gesture of sacrifice but that was small consolation to those of us who had learned to love him it was hard to imagine continuing our work without him if we continued it my spouse radcliffe emerson is without doubt the preeminent egyptologist of this or any other era to say that emerson who prefers to be addressed by that name has the most explosive temper of anyone i know might be a slight exaggeration but only slight his passions are most often aroused by incompetent excavators and careless scholarship and during this past season he had i admit been sorely provoked we had been excavating in the valley of the kings at luxor my favorite site in all of egypt the concession for the valley was held by an irritating elderly american mr theodore davis who was more interested in finding treasure than in scholarly research we were there under sufferance allowed to work only in the lesser more boring tombs still we were there and we would be there again in the autumn had it not been for emerson the trouble began when mr daviss crew discovered one of the strangest most mysterious tombs ever found in the valley it was a hodgepodge of miscellaneous funerary equipment much of it in poor condition including a mummy and coffin and pieces of a magnificent golden shrine and if it had been properly investigated new light would have been shed on a particularly intriguing era of egyptian history in vain did we offer mr davis the services of our staff abdullah who was still with us was the most experienced reis in egypt our son ramses was a skilled linguist and excavator and his friend david an equally skilled copyist not to mention our foster daughter nefret to whose excavation experience was added medical training and a thorough acquaintance with mummies only an egotistical idiot would have refused davis did refuse he regarded excavation as entertainment not as a tool in scholarly research and he was jealous of a better man he wanted no one to interfere with his toy watching davis rip the tomb apart i quote emerson was trying enough the denouement came on the day when the mummy fell apart due to careless handling it might not have survived anyhow but emerson was in no state of mind to admit that face handsomely flushed blue eyes blazing impressive form towering over that of the withered old american emerson expressed his sentiments in the ringing tones and rich vocabulary that have earned him his sobriquet of abu shitaim father of curses he included in them m maspero the distinguished head of the service des antiquit233s maspero really had no choice but to accede to daviss infuriated demand that we be barred from the valley altogether there are many other sites in luxor maspero offered several of them to emerson by that time emerson was in such a state of fury that he rejected them all and when we sailed from port said we had no idea where we would be working the following season it was good to be back at our english home in kent and i make it a point to look on the bright side but as spring turned to summer and summer wore on my attempts to do so failed miserably it rained incessantly the roses developed mildew rose our admirable housekeeper caught a nasty cold that refused to yield to treatment she went snuffling drearily around the house and gargery our butler drove me wild with his incessant prying and his pointed hints that he be allowed to come to egypt with us in the autumn emerson sulking in his study like a gargoyle refused to discuss our future plans he knew he had been in the wrong but would not admit it and his attempts to get back in my good graces had i confess not been well received as a rule i welcome my husbands attentions his thick black locks and brilliant blue eyes his magnificent physique and how shall i put it the expertise with which he fulfills his marital obligations moved me as they always had but i resented his efforts to get round me by taking advantage of my feelings instead of throwing himself on my mercy and begging forgiveness by the end of july all our tempers had become strained it continued to rain emerson continued to sulk rose continued to snuffle and gargerys nagging never stopped oh madam you need me you know you do only see what happened last year when i was not there to look after you mr ramses and mr david kidnapped and you carried off by that master criminal chap and poor abdullah murdered and do be quiet gargery i shouted i asked you to serve tea i did not invite a lecture gargery stiffened and looked down his snub nose at me i am one of the few people who is shorter than he and he takes full advantage tea will be in shortlymadam he said and stalked out i seldom shout at the servants in point of fact gargery is the only one i do shout at as a butler he was something of an anomaly and his unusual talents such as his skill at wielding a cudgel had proved helpful to us in the past guardian of the horizon
