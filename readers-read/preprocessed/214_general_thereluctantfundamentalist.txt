 excuse me sir but may i be of assistance ah i see i have alarmed you do not be frightened by my beard i am a lover of america i noticed that you were looking for something more than looking in fact you seemed to be on a mission and since i am both a native of this city and a speaker of your language i thought i might offer you my services how did i know you were american no not by the color of your skin we have a range of complexions in this country and yours occurs often among the people of our northwest frontier nor was it your dress that gave you away a european tourist could as easily have purchased in des moines your suit with its single vent and your buttondown shirt true your hair shortcropped and your expansive chest the chest i would say of a man who benchpresses regularly and maxes out well above twotwentyfive are typical of a certain type of american but then again sportsmen and soldiers of all nationalities tend to look alike instead it was your bearing that allowed me to identify you and i do not mean that as an insult for i see your face has hardened but merely as an observation come tell me what were you looking for surely at this time of day only one thing could have brought you to the district of old anarkali named as you may be aware after a courtesan immured for loving a prince and that is the quest for the perfect cup of tea have i guessed correctly then allow me sir to suggest my favorite among these many establishments yes this is the one its metal chairs are no better upholstered its wooden tables are equally rough and it is like the others open to the sky but the quality of its tea i assure you is unparalleled you prefer that seat with your back so close to the wall very well although you will benefit less from the intermittent breeze which when it does blow makes these warm afternoons more pleasant and will you not remove your jacket so formal now that is not typical of americans at least not in my experience and my experience is substantial i spent four and a half years in your country where i worked in new york and before that attended college in new jersey yes you are right it was princeton quite a guess i must say what did i think of princeton well the answer to that question requires a story when i first arrived i looked around me at the gothic buildings younger i later learned than many of the mosques of this city but made through acid treatment and ingenious stonemasonry to look older and thought this is a dream come true princeton inspired in me the feeling that my life was a film in which i was the star and everything was possible i have access to this beautiful campus i thought to professors who are titans in their fields and fellow students who are philosopherkings in the making i was i must admit overly generous in my initial assumptions about the standard of the student body they were almost all intelligent and many were brilliant but whereas i was one of only two pakistanis in my entering class two from a population of over a hundred million souls mind you the americans faced much less daunting odds in the selection process a thousand of your compatriots were enrolled five hundred times as many even though your countrys population was only twice that of mine as a result the nonamericans among us tended on average to do better than the americans and in my case i reached my senior year without having received a single b looking back now i see the power of that system pragmatic and effective like so much else in america we international students were sourced from around the globe sifted not only by wellhoned standardized tests but by painstakingly customized evaluations interviews essays recommendations until the best and the brightest of us had been identified i myself had among the top exam results in pakistan and was besides a soccer player good enough to compete on the varsity team which i did until i damaged my knee in my sophomore year students like me were given visas and scholarships complete financial aid mind you and invited into the ranks of the meritocracy in return we were expected to contribute our talents to your society the society we were joining and for the most part we were happy to do so i certainly was at least at first every fall princeton raised her skirt for the corporate recruiters who came onto campus and as you say in america showed them some skin the skin princeton showed was good skin of course young eloquent and clever as can be but even among all that skin i knew in my senior year that i was something special i was a perfect breast if you will tan succulent seemingly defiant of gravity and i was confident of getting any job i wanted except one underwood samson company you have not heard of them they were a valuation firm they told their clients how much businesses were worth and they did so it was said with a precision that was uncanny they were small a boutique really employing a bare minimum of people and they paid well offering the fresh graduate a base salary of over eighty thousand dollars but more importantly they gave one a robust set of skills and an exalted brand name so exalted in fact that after two or three years there as an analyst one was virtually guaranteed admission to harvard business school because of this over a hundred members of the princeton class of 2001 sent their grades and rsums to underwood samson eight were selected not for jobs i should make clear but for interviews and one of them was me you seem worried do not be this burly fellow is merely our waiter and there is no need to reach under your jacket i assume to grasp your wallet as we will pay him later when we are done would you prefer regular tea with milk and sugar or green tea or perhaps their more fragrant specialty kashmiri tea excellent choice i will have the same and perhaps a plate of jalebis as well there he has gone i must admit he is a rather intimidating chap but irreproachably polite you would have been surprised by the sweetness of his speech if only you understood urdu where were we ah yes underwood samson on the day of my interview i was uncharacteristically nervous they had sent a single interviewer and he received us in a room at the nassau inn an ordinary room mind you not a suite they knew we were sufficiently impressed already when my turn came i entered and found a man physically not unlike yourself he too had the look of a seasoned army officer changez he said and i nodded for that is indeed my name come on in and take a seat
