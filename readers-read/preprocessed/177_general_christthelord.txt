through people who were shouting over my head until i got to eleazer8217s house the women all had their backs to the door and they didn8217t see me as i went around the edge of the room i went right into the dark room where they8217d laid him on the mat his mother was there leaning on her sister and sobbing there was only one lamp very weak eleazer was pale with his arms at his sides same soiled tunic and the soles of his feet very black he was dead his mouth was open and his white teeth showed over his lip the greek physician came in8212he was really a jew8212and he knelt down and he looked
