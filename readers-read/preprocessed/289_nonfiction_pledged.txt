 introduction quotdelta delta delta can we help ya help ya help yaquot or so do they really have topless pillow fights because ive never been a member of any girlonly group other than sports teams i didnt know much about sororities when i started researching this book actually i was slightly afraid of them we outsiders who can only envision what goes on behind sorority house walls and inside sorority girls heads merely have movies such as revenge of the nerds animal house and legally blonde to inform our views about sororities those of us with the more salacious of imaginations or the more bmovie of tastes might associate with sororities the topless pillow fights that must inevitably occur when fifty estrogenladen creatures gather for a sleepover or so men everywhere fervently pray or perhaps a heathersinspired coldness might come to mind as we visualize the vicious hairtearing earringtwisting catfights between sororities clamoring for the most popular fraternity to escort them to homecoming or our image of sororities as was mine is the tamer more relatable version the popular group of girls from high school cooler prettier wealthier multiplied by ten living under one roof and recognized officially by their college as a clique i dont think i realized the extent to which i was an outsider however until i found myself smack in a bustling epicenter of sorority life a quotgreek boutiquequot at a conference for sorority and fraternity representatives the room was swathed in the hyperprecise sorority colors not blue and yellow but quotold bluequot and quotcaf au laitquot sigma delta tau not green and white but quotolive greenquot and quotpearl whitequot kappa delta i was surrounded by sorority letters colors and symbols stamped on drawn on embossed on engraved in carved into or welded onto such a variety of objects that it felt as if i had arrived in a disney gift shop for quotsororitylandquot as i watched sorority sisters in expensivelooking clothes try on kitschy jewelry they likely wouldnt deign to wear if it didnt bear their sorority letters i wondered what possessed them to feel such passion for objects i obviously didnt understand here on table upon table of items divided neatly by individual sororities and their corresponding colors sororities also have certain mascots symbols jewels and flowers such as delta phi epsilons quotlovely purple irisquot the sisters had their pick of sorority emery boards money pouches picture frames bottle openers and refrigerator magnets lips feeling dry try the boutiques quotsorority lip balmquot bathroom not smelling sparkly clean heres a sorority air freshener crave a more elegant hygienic experience how about sorority bath crystals gesundheit have a sorority tissue in the long line at the cash register sorority girls fussed and quotfabulousquoted over the souvenirs twittering in italics about such foreign jargon as rush crushes cold dorms and prefs i was officially entering sorority world a world of high priestesses temples and secret handshakes a world so entirely different from my nongreek experience that it had a name for people like me people unaffiliated and unlettered quotoh quot one girl drawled in a honeyed southern accent quotyoure a gdiquot a gdi quota goddamn independentquot oh clearly this wasnt going to be your everyday reporting assignment in order to understand this world so fully that i could portray it fairly and accurately i realized i needed to have so engulfing an experience that i would be living breathing and shopping sorority my first plan was to try to follow a sorority throughout the 20022003 academic year to become such an everpresent fixture in the house that i would be treated as something like an honorary member i canvassed several campuses in search of an appropriate group to shadow a national group affiliated with a quothistorically whitequot national sorority organization white and black sororities are still largely segregated the sororities illustrated in this book are quothistorically whitequot unless otherwise noted finally a sister invited me to observe her group a popular sorority at a school whose greek system had been under fire in recent years because of several hazingrelated deaths the day i was to visit the house i agonized over my outfit blowdried my hair straight put on more makeup than usual and dug my spikiest ankle boots out of the recesses of my closet admittedly because not many of my friends were sorority sisters i was nervous about entering an entire house full of them the more i learned about sororities the more bizarre their world seemed as i tottered up to the porch i suddenly didnt feel like a twentysixyearold investigative reporter preparing to dig into another project about secret group behavior i felt like the kid i was in junior high school wearing sweatpants and soccer sandals hoping to please everyone but at the same time trying hard to pretend not to care later that afternoon i was curled up on a bunk bed and chatting with two of the sorority girls sometime during the emotional story one sister shared about how a sorority rivalry destroyed her relationship with her longtime best friend i flashed back to my camp counselor days and had visions of serving as a kind of resident big sister to these girls it hit me then that when i attended overnight camp my teenaged bunk acted in ways that were somewhat similar to sororities we traveled in packs had rivalries with other bunks pressured each other to break rules and even fought over the same guy who coincidentally eventually became the president of his fraternity at the school where i now sat here at the sorority house was a group that similarly provided selected college girls an automatic sense of belonging no talent or niche required a builtin social network to accompany a girl to bars parties sporting events and study sessions this comparison caused me not only to wonder if sorority girls were so different from the rest of us but also to think that had i attended a larger college maybe i would have been a sorority girl too but when the girls gave me a tour of the house they told me about their sisters diet pill addiction their pride in the fact that they hazed new girls and their quotdrug roomquot which displayed a bong several bottles of pills and some suspiciouslooking white powder some of the girls regularly did cocaine if i had joined a sorority i asked myself would i like the girls i met inevitably have fallen into the kind of herd mentality among sororities that can encourage conformity cliquishness and compromising morals at that initial point in my research i didnt know after several days of observing this major national sorority i was approached by the adviser of the house a stern heavyset sorority alumna who looked much older than her twentysomething years she led me into the quotscholarship roomquot a small room with computers and a large file cabinet full of notes tests and papers from various classes offered at the school she told me to sit down and locked the glass door girls peered in quizzically as they walked by but a quick glare from the adviser sent them scurrying on quotyou shouldnt have been given permission to be herequot she said gruffly she interrupted herself by cursing under her breath and yelling in her deep voice at the girls she could see through a window who were smoking cigarettes on the front porch quotyoure not allowed to smoke in front of the house it doesnt look goodquot the girls reluctantly slinked away the adviser turned back to me quotyou need to get permission from the national office which is probably not going to give it to youquot she paused again quotand if for some reason they do i simply cannot allow you to write about the drugsquot when i got home i called the sororitys national office and explained what i was doing figuring this process of obtaining official permission was just a formality the executive director however said otherwise mtv had just aired a show called sorority life which followed the sixweek pledge process of a california sorority a quotlocalquot sorority which meant it was independent and unaffiliated with any national organization the show had infuriated sororities nationwide who believed that mtv had overly sensationalized life in a sorority house and concentrated only on the girls drinking and catty fights quotbecause of the mtv showquot the executive director told me quotall of the national sororities have decided on a blanket policy not to cooperate with any members of the media its just not appropriate at this timequot with that i was suddenly completely closed off from a group of several dozen sorority girls i had already started to like realizing that i wouldnt be able to openly observe a sorority house unless i received permission from its national office i called other national sorority headquarters to state my case one by one every national office i talked to shut me out of their houses even as i told them i was presenting a truthful not necessarily negative account of what sorority life is really like quotwere gunshyquot said one quotweve gotten several media calls even this week and were turning them all downquot said another the twentysix member groups of the national panhellenic conference which was established in 1902 to oversee the historically white national sororities had laid down the law i didnt understand the panicked responses of the national offices which claim to instill within their sororities quotindividuality togetherness and friendshipsquot according to the web site for alpha epsilon phi whose motto is quotmany hearts one purposequot they promote goals such as delta delta deltas to quotdevelop a stronger and more womanly character to broaden the moral and intellectual life and to assist its members in every possible wayquot they foster like kappa kappa gamma quotfriendship rooted in a tradition of high standardsquot these aspirations seemed laudable these institutions beneficial one would assume the reallife sororities therefore have so much to offer that their positives would far outweigh their negatives but when one schools panhellenic adviser attempted to blacklist me on her campus for writing this book she insisted she must quotprotect our womenquot the question was protect them from what because no sorority would knowingly let me tail its sisters for the year it became necessary for me to fly under the radar of both the national offices and the sorority girls themselves i sought out individual sisters who were willing to risk their sorority membership by letting me into their lives for an entire academic year knowing that they could not tell anyone their sorority sisters their friends their families who i really was i cant divulge how the four girls i chose who knew they would be the main characters in a book i was writing about sororities introduced me to their sisters who did not know and i cant disclose the disguise i wore or role i played when spending time with these groups suffice it to say i can pass for nineteen to further protect the four girls who could be ostracized and even thrown out of the greek system if their identities were revealed i have given pseudonyms to them their school and their schools greek groups and have changed identifying details but their dilemmas emotions interactions and dialogues are real the girls didnt know i also monitored their instant messenger away messages which they changed sometimes as frequently as once an hour away messages are bulletins that im users post online so that friends can see what they are up to like many college students the girls used their away messages to convey their state of mind or broadcast their whereabouts in order to provide a balanced view of sororities i selected goodhearted girls who were members of quotnormalquot sororities not known on campus as extreme stereotypes i also chose these girls on the basis of their diverse attitudes toward and roles in their sororities these sisters one of whom was a sorority officer are largely the kind of girls whom the national offices would be proud to have represent them had the national offices been willing to allow themselves to be represented the two juniors and two sophomores all attend a school ill call state university a campus on which greek life is considered important but not essential it turned out that quotgoing undercoverquot gave me more candid access to the sororities than i would have had openly as a reporter because i played the role i did the sisters didnt know to censor their behavior in front of me and my four main subjects tended to view me more as a friend than a journalist with that said however i would not presume that the experiences of these four sisters alone could accurately represent a sorority system of millions many of the posts on greek system message boards constantly remind readers that its not right to let a few renegade sisters or even chapters represent the image of the entire sorority system i took this message to heart my four girls arent renegades nevertheless i have supplemented my observations of them with visits and interviews with scores of other sorority girls by the time i finished writing pledged i had spoken with or met with several hundred girls essentially i got to return to college and experience the path i had not taken the first time around and had a far better time than i did when i was actually enrolled in college when a sorority girl needed a date to a date party i went when sisters went shopping together i joined them when new members danced exuberantly on bid day so did i though i couldnt incorporate all of the hundreds of interviews in this book the sisters frank assessments of sorority life shaped my observations in writing this book the surprise for me and this may delight many readers was that the notions of those topless pillow fights may not have been so far off base after all in the back of my mind i dont think i ever really believed that sororities were quite as campy as their conventional image but at about the time i heard about traditions like quotnaked partyquot and quotboob rankingquot i had to reconsider i learned that many of the rumors as well as the fantasies about sororities are indeed staggeringly true including those concerning loyalty sex conformity drugs violence verbal abuse mind games prostitution racism forced binge drinking nudity cheating eating disorders rituals quotmean girlsquot and secrecy but not all sororities encompass these experiences and of the sororities that do not all consist of girls one would necessarily consider quotbadquot much of sorority life espouses noble purpose and the friendships and philanthropy encouraged by these organizations can enhance a girls college experience boost her selfesteem and better her character but the prevalence of the aforementioned litany which still occurs on several campuses nationwide in the name of tradition speaks volumes about larger issues concerning women higher education and female group dynamics even halfway into the year i was plagued by questions why are twentyfirstcentury women still so eager to participate in such seemingly outdated ritualistic groups and activities what is the purpose of sororities and what does membership truly require of the sisters how does a sisterhood change the way a girl thinks about herself do sororities cause women to fall further behind in the gender wars or are they instead womens secret weapon my challenge then in writing pledged was how to reconcile the unexpected discovery of a dark side to sorority life with the observation that many of the girls who participate in it and continue to join it in droves are quotnormalquot girls girls who are sweet smart successful and kind both before and after they join girls and this puzzled me who by years end no longer intimidated me girls who would be surprised to read how their sororities appear from an outsiders point of view
