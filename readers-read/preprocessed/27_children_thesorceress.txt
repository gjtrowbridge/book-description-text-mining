 i think i see them8221 the young man in the green parka standing directly beneath the huge circular clock in st pancras station took the phone away from his ear and checked a blurred image on the screen the english magician had sent the image the picture was grainy the colors washed and faded and it looked liked it had been taken from an overhead security camera it showed an older man with short gray hair accompanied by two blondhaired teens climbing onto a train rising up on his toes the young man swiveled his head looking for the trio he8217d glimpsed for a moment he thought he8217d lost them in the milling crowd but even if he had they wouldn8217t get far one of his sisters was downstairs another was in the street outside watching the entrance now where had the old man and the teenagers gone narrow pinched nostrils opened wide as the young man sorted through the countless scents in the station he identified and dismissed the mixed stink of too many humani the myriad perfumes and deodorants the gels and pastes the greasy odor of fried food from the station8217s restaurants the richer aroma of coffee and the metallic oily tang of the train engines and carriages he closed his eyes and tilted his head back the odors he was seeking were older wilder unnatural there mint just the merest suggestion orange no more than the vaguest hint vanilla little more than a trace hidden behind small rectangular sunglasses blueblack eyes opened wide and his head swiveled following the gossamer threads of scent through the vast train station he had them now the grayhaired older man wearing black jeans and a scuffed leather jacket was striding down the station concourse directly toward him there was a small overnight case in his left hand he was followed by the two teenagers alike enough to be brother and sister the boy was taller than the girl and they were both wearing backpacks the young man snapped a quick picture with his cell phone camera and sent it to dr john dee although he had nothing but contempt for the english magician there was no point in making an enemy of him dee was the agent of the most dangerous of all the elders pulling the hood of his parka over his head he turned away as the trio drew level with him and dialed his sister who was waiting downstairs 8220it8217s definitely flamel and the twins8221 he murmured into the phone speaking the ancient language that had eventually become gaelic 8220they8217re heading in your direction we8217ll take them when they get onto the euston road8221 the young man in the hooded parka set off after the alchemyst and the american twins he moved easily through the earlyafternoon crowd looking like just another teenager anonymous and unnoticed in his sloppy jeans scuffed sneakers and overlarge coat his head and face concealed by the hood his eyes invisible behind the sunglasses despite his form the young man had never been remotely human he and his sisters had first come to this land when it was still joined to the european continent and for generations they had been worshipped as gods he bitterly resented being ordered about by dee8211who was after all nothing more than a humani but the english magician had promised the hooded boy a delectable prize nicholas flamel the legendary alchemyst dee8217s instructions were clear he and his sisters could have flamel but the twins must not be touched the boy8217s thin lips twisted his sisters would take the boy and girl while he would have the honor of killing flamel a coalblack tongue licked cracked dry lips he and his sisters would feast for weeks and of course they would keep the tastiest morsels for mother nicholas flamel slowed allowing sophie and josh to catch up with him forcing a smile he pointed to the thirtyfoot tall bronze statue of a couple embracing beneath the clock 8220it8217s called the meeting place 8221 he said loudly and then added in a whisper 8220we8217re being followed8221 flamel grasped josh8217s arm with ironhard fingers 8220don8217t even think about turning around8221 8220who8221 sophie asked 8220what8221 josh said tightly he was feeling nauseated his newly awakened senses were overwhelmed by the scents and sounds of the train station the light was so sharp he wished he had a pair of sunglasses to shield his eyes 8220 8216what8217 is the better question8221 nicholas said grimly he raised a finger to point up to the clock as if he were talking about it 8220i8217m not sure what it is8221 he admitted 8220something ancient i felt it the moment we stepped off the train8221 8220felt it8221 josh asked 8220a tingle like an itch my aura reacted to the aura of whoever8211 whatever 8211is here when you have a little more control of your own auras you8217ll be able to do the same8221 tilting her head back as if she were admiring the latticework of the metalandglass ceiling sophie slowly turned crowds swirled around them most seemed to be locals though there were plenty of tourists many stopping to have their photographs taken in front of the meeting place or the huge clock no one seemed to be paying them any particular attention 8220what can we do8221 josh asked 8220i can boost sophie8217s powers 8221 8220no8221 flamel snapped 8220you can only use your powers as an absolute last resort as soon as you activate your aura it will alert every elder next generation and immortal within a tenmile radius and here just about every immortal you encounter is allied to the dark elders also in this land it could awaken others creatures best left sleeping8221 8220but you said we8217re being followed8221 sophie protested 8220that means dee knows we8217re here8221 flamel urged the twins to the left away from the statue hurrying them toward the exit 8220i would imagine there are watchers in every airport seaport and railway station across europe although dee might have suspected that we were heading to london the instant either of you activates your aura he8217ll know for certain8221
