 chapter 1 the cabin was cool and dark smelling of wood isabel set down her duffel bag inside the front door without looking at the unknown rooms on either side she went straight down the dim hall to the door at the far end a bright oblong of light she pushed open the screen and stood looking out over the porch to the lake beyond it was late afternoon the broad lake was still full of light but across it on the western shore was a rising mass of shadow the water was quiet the reflections perfectly still there in silvery echoes were the low wooded hills that ringed the lake with the pure indigo sky above it isabel heard her husband behind her his footsteps hollow on the bare floorboards when he reached her she spoke without turning 8220this is beautiful8221 it was her first visit here she had only been married to paul since february seven months 8220we like it8221 paul said he had come here every summer of his life fiftyone years he stood just behind isabel setting his hands on her shoulders he was tall but lightboned rangy and lean without bulk his hands on her were nearly weightless 8220we8217re letting the flies out8221 he said and isabel stepped obediently onto the porch his hands awkwardly still on her the outer walls of acorn cabin were unpainted shingle faded to silver gray from decades of adirondack weather beyond the porch8217s rustic railing8212peeled gnarly cedar8212the ground sloped down mildly toward the water 8220let8217s go to the lake8221 isabel said they had spent the day in the car driving up from new york and what she wanted now was air and light open water exploration of the dark rooms of the cabin could wait paul led the way down a narrow path through underbrush and young saplings the air was dry and ferny and sweet through the trees the sight of water flickered intermittently pale and calm it was lost between branches glimpsed again glittering and wider and then finally as they turned a corner and arrived at the shore the lake spread out before them shimmering and complete down here at its edge the lake looked vast its stillradiant surface immense and untouched around them was silence the faint sibilance of air moving in the treetops nothing more it smelled of summer trees lake water heat 8220this is heaven8221 isabel said her voice in the great openness around her was small paul put his arm around her 8220exactly8221 he said with satisfaction 8220now will you never leave me8221 this combination8212warmth and absurdity8212made isabel laugh she felt a surge of affection then a flare of hope maybe this will work hope was what isabel was bringing to this marriage it was nearly all she had grief itself was a kind of death it seemed two years of it had scoured her bare of other feelings the time seemed past in which joy would rise easily to the surface of her heart and fill it grief had established itself at the center of her life and though it no longer stormed through her drenching and overwhelming as it had at first it was not gone she still felt the grayness of her first husband8217s absence from the world the silence everywhere without his voice the pain at being unable to tell him things that she missed him that she longed for him that she still loved him that she hated him for being gone it had not seemed that grief would ever leave but after two years it had diminished and she had determined herself to move on to leave that gray landscape what she felt for paul was quieter than what she8217d felt for michael but everything in her life seemed quieter this kind of emotion8212calm and muted8212was what was left to her she was fortyseven all the other things8212wildness and bliss and desperation rage the urgency of sex8212lay behind her she no longer expected them what she aimed for now was loyalty and affection much of marriage was partnership she didn8217t want to be old alone when she was old she wanted someone with her whom she trusted someone she knew what she felt for paul was a powerful tenderness and she knew this would increase affection deepens over time and hardship compassion strengthens with the years what isabel wanted was something quiet durable domestic a backwater somewhere safe she was done with storms she leaned against paul she was still trying to learn his body still teaching her own to expect it there were moments when it still felt strange too tall too angular for comfort she tilted her head back against paul8217s chest and looked straight up at the great arch of sky 8220it8217s so clear8221 she said 8220too clear actually8221 paul answered 8220we8217re hoping for rain there8217s a serious drought it8217s hardly rained in months8221 isabel looked again scanning the deep blue for a wisp of cloud a skein of high mist but there was nothing the reaches overhead were empty she liked paul8217s knowing about the weather here even when he was away 8220did you come up here for the whole summer8221 she asked 8220when you were little8221 8220always a month sometimes six weeks8221 paul answered 8220my mother would come up with me and whit my father came up for long weekends and the last couple of weeks in august my grandparents were here for the whole summer we stayed in acorn they stayed in the lodge8221 sweetwater lodge was the original house built by paul8217s maternal greatgrandparents in the 1890s the three cabins8212acorn oyster and whistle8212had been built during the twenties for grown children over a century later the whole place8212the houses and several hundred acres of land8212was owned by a complicated family trust paul8217s mother and her two brothers each spent a summer month at the lodge their children in the cottages just now paul8217s parents douglas and charlotte were in the lodge paul and isabel were to have acorn for two weeks 8220do you and whitney share the cottage8221 isabel asked 8220no it8217s mine unless he gets married the rule is you don8217t get a cabin until you8217re married until then you stay at the lodge8221 isabel had never met paul8217s brother whitney he lived in wyoming where he did something in the national parks he hadn8217t been able to come to their wedding a blizzard had closed the laramie airport for three days he was fortyfive unmarried isabel had wondered if he was gay but it was a question she wasn8217t ready to ask there was a faint chill in paul8217s voice when he spoke of whitney 8220and will whit get married do you think8221 isabel risked 8220doubtful8221 paul said cool probably gay then she thought maybe that was why paul was so disapproving 8220does he come here often8221 8220not anymore8221 paul said 8220i guess the adirondacks are small potatoes compared to the bighorns8221 8220and geordie8221 geordie was paul8217s son from his first marriage his only child geordie was twentyeight and lived in vancouver where he was a producer for the local television station isabel had met him only once at their wedding geordie was tall and lanky like paul with a long face nearly identical to his father8217s the same high cheekbones the same ascetic hollows in the lean cheeks the same wide mobile mouth isabel had been so happy to meet him he8217d seemed so like another earlier version of his father that she felt as though she8217d been magically permitted to meet paul as a young man she8217d stepped forward beaming to embrace this other earlier paul but geordie would have none of it he had leaned away from her embrace his expression cool and distant he barely put his arms around her his touch was light and unwilling he bowed ironically as she kissed his cheek he scarcely met her eyes and his gaze flicked away at once disappointed isabel stepped back and dropped her arms to her sides what had his mother told him about her 8220as a matter of fact this will be the first summer geordie has missed8221 paul said 8220why isn8217t he coming8221 8220he8217s been invited on a great rockclimbing trip apparently it was an offer he couldn8217t refuse8221 isabel wondered if geordie8217s absence was because of her presence she wondered whether paul would tell her isabel8217s own son ben would not be coming up to the lake either he was working for a law firm in new york for the summer and it was too long a trip for a weekend ben and geordie had met at the wedding too isabel had hoped they8217d become friends but when she saw them stiffly shaking hands their chins lifted warily she saw they would not it was too late to make a new family everyone was too old these two would never feel like brothers they were genetic competitors from different herds ben had been welcoming to paul at least and he8217d been kind when isabel had first told him they were in the apartment in her bedroom isabel was sitting in the maple chair at her desk ben on her bed 8220i want you to meet someone8221 she said it felt awkward to say this like a confession 8220do you mind8221 she asked anxious 8220does it feel like a betrayal8220 ben sat slouching his knees splayed his feet were tipped on their sides soles facing each other 8220no8221 he shook his head looking down at his running shoes 8220i8217ve thought about this it8217ll be weird to see you with someone else but i don8217t want you to be alone you should be happy you should have someone8221 he raised his head and looked at her 8220dad8217s gone8221 at the wedding ben had stayed near once during the reception when paul put his arm around her she felt ben8217s gaze on her and turned he smiled and silently lifted his glass high and ceremonial now isabel and paul stood side by side without touching the lake was silent far out on the water some creature rose to the surface with a small tock then fell away ripples moved swiftly away from the vanished presence here is his center isabel thought 8220does it make you nervous having me here8221 she asked teasing 8220not so far8221 paul said 8220should it is it dangerous8221 8220just that i8217ll know so much about you you8217ll have nowhere to hide i feel as though your whole life is here8221 8220that8217s sort of the point8221 paul said he reached up and smoothed her hair clumsily as though he were stroking a dog 8220we8217re in this together now i trust you8221 he smiled at her 8220do you want to go back and unpack take the grand tour of the cabin8221 they turned from the lake and set off up the path through the trees acorn cabin was small and simple a center hall with three tiny bedrooms on one side a kitchen and bathroom on the other the walls were unpainted wood the color of dark honey the floors were bare and the rooms were lit by ceiling bulbs 8220this is us8221 said paul opening the door to the bedroom closest to the lake on either side of the window was a single bed neatly made up with a faded green bedspread between the beds stood a square table of unpeeled white birch on the walls were flyspecked blackandwhite photographs of adirondack views flat lakes rising mountains 8220wonderful8221 said isabel looking around the room felt clean the floor was swept and the air held the faintly spicy smell of old wood 8220was this your room when you were little8221 8220of course not8221 paul said 8220the grownups got the lake view the children got the impenetrable forest vistas8221 the next room was smaller with two bunk beds a rushbottomed chair stood against the wall the window looked into the deep woods 8220this was mine8221 paul said 8220no view but since i was older i got the room closer to the view8221 8220there8217s nothing of you here8221 isabel said looking around 8220didn8217t you have a panda or something wasn8217t there something you always went to see when you first arrived8221 8220not inside8221 paul said 8220there are places like that out in the woods the tree where my hideout was where i used to ambush whit8221 8220why didn8217t you two share a room8221 isabel asked 8220you make it sound as though you were deadly enemies8221 paul shrugged turning to leave 8220whit and i always had separate rooms we fought a lot fighting was the way we played we spent all our time together but it was strategic interaction not fraternizing war was our business8221 the spartan room next door was identical the bare bunks the slatbacked chair isabel moved on to the kitchen the largest room it had blurred linoleum on the floor and open shelves full of cans there was a small electric stove a deep porcelain sink and an old highlegged refrigerator the square wooden table had a metal top around it stood four highbacked chairs isabel looked around at the room 8220i can8217t picture louisa here8221 she said louisa8212formidable opinionated impatient8212would have had something to say about this shadowy antiquated setup from what isabel had gathered louisa had something to say about everything louisa had left paul just as she was getting her phd in french literature at columbia university after eighteen years of marriage she had come home after taking her orals and asked him to move out she was adamant paul told isabel there was no discussion it had come as a headringing blow to him he had thought they were happy but louisa had been chillingly sure they were not she now taught 8220balzac and the rise of the nineteenth century8221 at barnard college
