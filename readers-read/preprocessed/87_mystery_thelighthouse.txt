commander adam dalgliesh was not unused to being urgently summoned to nonscheduled meetings with unspecified people at inconvenient times but usually with one purpose in common he could be confident that somewhere there lay a dead body awaiting his attention there were other urgent calls other meetings sometimes at the highest level dalgliesh as a permanent adc to the commissioner had a number of functions which as they grew in number and importance had become so illdefined that most of his colleagues had given up trying to define them but this meeting called in assistant commissioner harkness8217s office on the seventh floor of new scotland yard at tenfiftyfive on the morning of saturday 23 october had from his first entry into the room the unmistakable presaging of murder this had nothing to do with a certain serious tension on the faces turned towards him a departmental debacle would have caused greater concern it was rather that unnatural death always provoked a peculiar unease an uncomfortable realisation that there were still some things that might not be susceptible to bureaucratic control there were only three men awaiting him and dalgliesh was surprised to see alexander conistone of the foreign and commonwealth office he liked conistone who was one of the few eccentrics remaining in an increasingly conformist and politicised service conistone had acquired a reputation for crisis management this was partly founded on his belief that there was no emergency that was not amenable to precedent or departmental regulations but when these orthodoxies failed he could reveal a dangerous capacity for imaginative initiatives which by any bureaucratic logic deserved to end in disaster but never did dalgliesh for whom few of the labyrinths of westminster bureaucracy were wholly unfamiliar had earlier decided that this dichotomy of character was inherited generations of conistones had been soldiers the foreign fields of britain8217s imperialistic past were enriched by the bodies of unmemorialised victims of previous conistones8217 crises management even conistone8217s eccentric appearance reflected a personal ambiguity alone among his colleagues he dressed with the careful pinstriped conformity of a civil servant of the thirties while with his strong bony face mottled cheeks and hair with the resilient waywardness of straw he looked like a farmer he was seated next to dalgliesh opposite one of the wide windows having sat through the first ten minutes of the present meeting with an unusual economy of words he sat his chair a little tilted complacently surveying the panorama of towers and spires lit by a transitory unseasonable morning sun of the four men in the room8212conistone adam dalgliesh assistant commissioner harkness and a freshfaced boy from mi5 who had been introduced as colin reeves8212conistone the one most concerned with the matter in hand had so far said the least while reeves preoccupied with the effort of remembering what was being said without the humiliating expedient of being seen to take notes hadn8217t yet spoken now conistone stirred himself for a summing up 8220murder would be the most embarrassing for us suicide hardly less so in the circumstances accidental death we could probably live with given the victim there8217s bound to be publicity whichever it is but it should be manageable unless this is murder the problem is that we haven8217t much time no date has been fixed yet but the pm would like to arrange this topsecret international gettogether in early january a good time parliament not sitting nothing much happens just after christmas nothing is expected to happen the pm seems to have set his mind on combe so you8217ll take on the case adam good8221 before dalgliesh could reply harkness broke in 8220the security rating if it comes off couldn8217t be higher8221 dalgliesh thought and even if you8217re in the know which i doubt you have no intention of telling me who will be meeting at this topsecret conference or why security was always on a needtoknow basis he could make his guesses but had no particular curiosity on the other hand he was being asked to investigate a violent death and there were things he needed to be told before colin reeves had time to realise that this was his cue to intervene conistone said 8220all that will be taken care of of course we8217re not expecting problems there was a similar situation some years ago8212before your time harkness8212when a vip politician thought he8217d like a respite from his protection officer and booked two weeks on combe the visitor stood the silence and solitude for two days before realising that his life was meaningless without his red boxes i should have thought that that was the message combe was established to convey but he didn8217t get it no i don8217t think we8217ll be worrying our friends south of the thames8221 well that at least was a relief to have the security services involved was always a complication dalgliesh reflected that the secret service like the monarchy in yielding up its mystique in response to public enthusiasm for greater openness seemed to have lost some of that halfecclesiastical patina of authority bestowed on those who dealt in esoteric mysteries today its head was known by name and pictured in the press the previous head had actually written her autobiography and its headquarters an eccentric orientallooking monument to modernity which dominated its stretch of the south bank of the thames seemed designed to attract rather than repel curiosity to surrender mystique had its disadvantages an organisation came to be regarded like any other bureaucracy staffed by the same fallible human beings and liable to the same cockups but he expected no problems with the secret service the fact that mi5 was represented at middlegrade level suggested that this single death on an offshore island was among the least of their present concerns he said 8220i can8217t go inadequately briefed you8217ve given me nothing except who8217s dead where he died and apparently how tell me about the island where exactly is it8221 harkness was in one of his more difficult moods his ill humour imperfectly concealed by selfimportance and a tendency to verbosity the large map on the table was a little crooked frowning he aligned it more accurately with the edge of the table pushed it towards dalgliesh and stabbed it with his forefinger 8220it8217s here combe island off the coast of cornwall about twenty miles southwest of lundy island and roughly twelve miles from the mainland pentworthy in this case newquay is the nearest large town8221 he looked over at conistone 8220you8217d better carry on it8217s more your baby than ours8221 conistone spoke directly to dalgliesh 8220i8217ll waste a little time on the history it explains combe and if you don8217t know it you may start under a disadvantage the island was owned for over four hundred years by the holcombe family who acquired it in the sixteenth century although no one seems clear exactly how probably a holcombe rowed out with a few armed retainers hoisted his personal standard and took it over there can8217t have been much competition the title was later ratified by henry the eighth once he8217d got rid of the mediterranean pirates who8217d established it as a base for their slavetrading raids along the devon and cornish coasts after that combe lay more or less neglected until the eighteenth century when the family began to take an interest in it and visited occasionally to look at the birdlife or spend the day picnicking then a gerald holcombe born in the late eighteen hundreds decided to use the island for family holidays he restored the cottages and in 1912 built a house and additional accommodation for the staff the family went there every summer in those heady days before the first world war the war changed everything the two elder sons were killed one in france the other at gallipoli the holcombes are the kind of family who die in wars not make money from them that left only the youngest henry who was consumptive and unfit for military service apparently after the death of his brothers he was oppressed by a sense of general unworthiness and had no particular wish to inherit the money hadn8217t come from land but from fortunate investments and by the late twenties they had more or less dried up so in 1930 he set up a charitable trust with what was left found some wealthy supporters and handed over the island and the property his idea was that it should be used as a place of rest and seclusion for men in positions of responsibility who needed to get away from the rigours of their professional lives8221 now for the first time he bent down to open his briefcase and took out a file with a security marking rummaging among the documents he brought out a single sheet of paper 8220i8217ve got the exact wording here it makes henry holcombe8217s intentions clear for men who undertake the dangerous and arduous business of exercising high responsibility in the service of the crown and of their country whether in the armed forces politics science industry or the arts and who require a restorative period of solitude silence and peace engagingly typical of its age isn8217t it no mention of women of course this was 1930 remember however the accepted convention is held to apply that the word 8216men8217 embraces women they take a maximum of five visitors whom they accommodate at their choice either in the main house or in one of the stone cottages basically what combe island offers is peace and security in the last few decades the latter has become probably the more important people who want time to think can go there without their protection officers in the knowledge that they will be safe and completely undisturbed there8217s a helicopter pad for bringing them in and the small harbour is the only possible landing place by sea no casual visitors are ever allowed and even mobile phones are forbidden8212they wouldn8217t get a signal there anyway they keep a very low profile people who go there are generally on personal recommendation either from a trustee or from a previous or regular visitor you can see its advantage for the pm8217s purpose8221 reeves blurted out 8220what8217s wrong with chequers8221 the others turned on him the brightly interested gaze of adults prepared to humour a precocious child conistone said 8220nothing an agreeable house with i understand every comfort but guests who are invited to chequers tend to get noticed isn8217t that the purpose of their going there8221 dalgliesh asked 8220how did downing street get to know about the island8221 conistone slid the paper back into his file 8220through one of the pm8217s newly ennobled chums he went to combe to recover from the dangerous and arduous responsibility of adding one more grocery chain to his empire and another billion to his personal fortune8221 8220there are some permanent staff presumably or do the vips do their own washing up8221 8220there8217s the secretary rupert maycroft previously a solicitor in warnborough we8217ve had to confide in him and of course inform the trustees that number ten would be grateful if some important visitors could be accommodated in early january at present it8217s all very tentative but we8217ve asked him to make no bookings after this month there are the usual staff8212boatman housekeeper cook we know something about all of them one or two of the previous visitors have been important enough to warrant security checks it8217s all been done very discreetly there8217s a resident physician dr guy staveley and his wife although i gather she8217s more off than on the island can8217t stand the boredom apparently staveley8217s a refugee from a london general practice apparently he made a wrong diagnosis and a child died so he8217s got himself a job where the worst that can happen is someone falling off a cliff and he can8217t be blamed for that8221 harkness said 8220only one resident has a criminal conviction the boatman jago tamlyn in 1998 for gbh i gather there were mitigating circumstances but it must have been a serious attack he got twelve months he8217s been in no trouble since8221 dalgliesh asked 8220when did the current visitors arrive8221 8220all five in the last week the writer nathan oliver together with his daughter miranda and copyeditor dennis tremlett came on monday a retired german diplomat dr raimund speidel exambassador to beijing came by private yacht from france on wednesday and dr mark yelland director of the hayesskolling research laboratory in the midlands which has been targeted by the animalliberation activists arrived on thursday maycroft will be able to put you in the picture8221 harkness broke in 8220better take the minimum of people at least until you know what you8217re dealing with the smaller the invasion the better8221 dalgliesh said 8220it will hardly be an invasion i8217m still awaiting a replacement for tarrant but i8217ll take inspector miskin and sergeant bentonsmith we can probably manage without a soco or official photographer at this stage but if it proves to be murder i8217ll have to have reinforcements or let the local force take over i8217ll need a pathologist i8217ll speak to kynaston if i can reach him he may be away from his lab on a case8221 harkness said 8220that won8217t be necessary we8217re using edith glenister you know her of course8221 8220hasn8217t she retired8221 conistone said 8220officially two years ago but she does work occasionally mostly on sensitive overseas cases at sixtyfive she8217s probably had enough of trudging gumbooted through muddy fields with the local cid examining decomposing bodies in ditches8221 dalgliesh doubted whether this was why professor glenister had officially retired he had never worked with her but he knew her reputation she was among the most highly regarded of women forensic pathologists notable for an almost uncanny accuracy in assessing the time of death for the speed and comprehensiveness of her reports and for the clarity and authority with which she gave evidence in court she was notable too for her insistence on maintaining the distinction between the functions of the pathologist and the investigating officer professor glenister he knew would never hear details of the circumstances of the murder before examining the body ensuring presumably that she came to the corpse with no preconceived ideas he was intrigued by the prospect of working with her and had no doubt that it was the fco who had originally suggested using her all the same he would have preferred his usual forensic pathologist he said 8220you8217re not implying that miles kynaston can8217t be trusted to keep his mouth shut8221 harkness broke in 8220of course not but cornwall is hardly his patch professor glenister is stationed at present in the southwest anyway kynaston isn8217t available we8217ve checked8221 dalgliesh was tempted to say how convenient for the fco they certainly hadn8217t lost any time harkness went on 8220you can pick her up at raf st mawgan near newquay and they8217ll arrange a special helicopter to take the body to the mortuary she uses she8217ll treat the case as urgent you should get her report sometime tomorrow8221 dalgliesh said 8220so maycroft rang you as soon as possible after finding the body i suppose he was following instructions8221 harkness said 8220he was given a phone number told that it was top secret and instructed to phone the trustees if anything untoward happened on the island he8217s been warned that you8217ll be arriving by helicopter and to expect you by early afternoon8221 dalgliesh said 8220he8217ll have some difficulty explaining to his colleagues why this particular death should attract a metropolitan police commander and a detective inspector instead of being dealt with by the local cid but i suppose you8217ve covered that8221 harkness said 8220as well as we can the chief constable has been put in the picture of course there8217s no point in arguing over which force should take responsibility until we know whether we8217ve got a murder to investigate in the meantime they8217ll cooperate if it is murder and the island is as secure as they claim there8217ll be a limited number of suspects that should speed up the inquiry8221 only someone ignorant of a murder investigation or who had conveniently forgotten the less successful incidents of his past could have been so misjudging a small group of suspects if each was intelligent and prudent enough to keep his or her counsel and resist the fateful impulse to volunteer more than was asked could complicate any investigation and bedevil the prosecution at the door conistone turned 8220the food8217s all right on combe island i suppose the beds comfortable8221 harkness said coolly 8220we8217ve had no time to enquire frankly it didn8217t occur to me i should have thought that whether the cook knows her job and the state of the mattresses is more your concern than ours our interest is in a dead body8221 conistone took the barb with good humour 8220true we8217ll check on the amenities if this conference comes off the first thing the rich and powerful learn is the value of comfort i should have mentioned that the last surviving holcombe is a permanent resident on the island miss emily holcombe aged eighty plus a former oxford academic history i believe your subject wasn8217t it adam8212but weren8217t you at the other place she8217ll either be an ally or a perfect nuisance if i know anything about academic women it will be the latter thank you for taking this on we8217ll be in touch8221 harkness rose to escort conistone and reeves out of the building leaving them at the lifts dalgliesh went back to his office first he must phone kate and bentonsmith after that there was a more difficult call he and emma lavenham were to have spent tonight and tomorrow together if she planned to spend the afternoon in london she might already be on her way he8217d have to reach her on her mobile phone it wouldn8217t be the first call of its kind and as always she would be half expecting it she wouldn8217t complain8212emma never did both of them had occasional urgent commitments and their time together was the more precious because it could never be relied upon and there were three words he wanted to say to her which he found he could never speak over the phone they too would have to wait he put his head round the door of his pa8217s room 8220get di miskin and sergeant bentonsmith for me will you susie then i8217ll need a car to go to battersea heliport picking up sergeant bentonsmith first then inspector miskin her murder case is in her office see that it8217s put in the car will you8221 the call could hardly have come at a less convenient time after a month of working a sixteenhour day tiredness had caught up with him and although he could manage tiredness what he longed for was rest peace and for two blessed days the company of emma he told himself that he had only himself to blame for the spoilt weekend he wasn8217t compelled to undertake a possible murder investigation however politically or socially important the victim or challenging the crime there were senior officers who would have preferred him to concentrate on initiatives with which he was already closely involved the complications of policing a multiracial society in which drugs terrorism and international crime conglomerates were the major challenges the proposal for a new detective force to deal with serious crimes best investigated nationally the plans would be bedevilled with politics toplevel policing always had been the met needed senior officers who were at ease in that duplicitous world he saw himself as in danger of becoming one more bureaucrat a committee member adviser coordinator8212not a detective if this happened would he any longer be a poet wasn8217t it in the rich soil of a murder investigation in the fascination of the gradual unveiling of truth in shared exertion and the prospect of danger and in the pitiableness of desperate and broken lives that his poetry put out its shoots but now with kate and bentonsmith on their way there were things to be done and quickly meetings to be tactfully cancelled papers to be locked away the publicrelations branch to be put in the picture he kept a bag always packed for these sudden emergencies but it was in his queenhithe flat and he was glad that he needed to call in there he had never yet phoned emma from new scotland yard she would know as soon as she heard his voice what he was about to say she would make her own arrangements for the weekend perhaps excluding him from her thoughts as he was from her company ten minutes later he closed the door of his office and for the first time with a backward glance as if taking leave of a longfamiliar place he might not see again
