jenkins supervisors as well as staff training programs specifically your refusal to give disseminate serve dessert to certain members of the senior staff has resulted in several written complaints from administrators at this establishment paper company mrs lopez your refusal to serve dessert to certain members of the papers staff is disruptive to food service operations and the explanations that you have provided for your behavior are not satisfactory wholly believable inexplicable acceptable this letter is being issued as a written warning with the expectation that there will be an immediate and sustained improvement in your work attitude food service dissemination job performance failure to comply will result in further disciplinary action on a more personal note mrs lopez please stop refusing to give senior staff members dessert even if you feel as you explained to me last week that they dont deserve it which members of the papers staff do or do not deserve dessert is
