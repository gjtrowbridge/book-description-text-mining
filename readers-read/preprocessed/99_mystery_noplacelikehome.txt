 chapter one twentyfour years later i cannot believe i am standing in the exact spot where i was standing when i killed my mother i ask myself if this is part of a nightmare or if it is really happening in the beginning after that terrible night i had nightmares all the time i spent a good part of my childhood drawing pictures of them for dr moran a psychologist in california where i went to live after the trial this room figured in many of those drawings the mirror over the fireplace is the same one my father chose when he restored the house it is part of the wall recessed and framed in it i see my reflection my face is deadly pale my eyes no longer seem dark blue but black reflecting all the terrible visions that are leaping through my mind the color of my eyes is a heritage from my father my mothers eyes were lighter a sapphire blue picture perfect with her golden hair my hair would be dark blond if i left it natural i have darkened it though ever since i came back to the east coast sixteen years ago to attend the fashion institute of technology in manhattan i am also taller than my mother was by five inches yet as i grow older i believe i am beginning to resemble my mother in many ways and i try to distance myself from that resemblance i have always lived in dread of someone saying to me you look familiar at the time my mothers image was splashed all over the media and still turns up periodically in stories that rehash the circumstances of her death so if anyone says i look familiar i know its her they have in mind i celia foster nolan formerly liza barton the child the tabloids dubbed little lizzie borden am far less likely to be recognized as that chubbyfaced little girl with golden curls who was acquitted not exonerated of deliberately killing her mother and trying to kill her stepfather my second husband alex nolan and i have been married for six months today i thought we were going to take my fouryearold son jack to see a horse show in peapack an upscale town in northern new jersey when suddenly alex detoured to mendham a neighboring town it was only then that he told me he had a wonderful surprise for my birthday and drove down the road to this house alex parked the car and we went inside jack is tugging at my hand but i remain frozen to the spot energetic as most fouryearolds are he wants to explore i let him go and in a flash he is out of the room and running down the hall alex is standing a little behind me without looking at him i can feel his anxiety he believes he has found a beautiful home for us to live in and his generosity is such that the deed is solely in my name his birthday gift to me ill catch up with jack honey he reassures me you look around and start figuring how youll decorate as he leaves the room i hear him call dont go downstairs jack we havent finished showing mommy her new house your husband tells me that youre an interior designer henry paley the real estate agent is saying this house has been very well kept up but of course every woman especially one in your profession wants to put her own signature on her home not yet trusting myself to speak i look at him paley is a small man of about sixty with thinning gray hair and neatly dressed in a dark blue pinstriped suit i realize he is waiting expectantly for me to show enthusiasm for the wonderful birthday gift my husband has just presented to me as your husband may have told you i was not the selling agent paley explains my boss georgette grove was showing your husband various properties nearby when he spotted the for sale sign on the lawn he apparently fell in love with it immediately the house is quite simply an architectural treasure and its situated on ten acres in the premier location in a premier town i know it is a treasure my father was the architect who restored a crumbling eighteenthcentury mansion turning it into this charming and spacious home i look past paley and study the fireplace mother and daddy found the mantel in france in a chteau about to be demolished daddy told me the meanings of all the sculptured work on it the cherubs and the pineapples and the grapes ted pinning mother against the wall mother sobbing i am pointing the gun at him daddys gun let go of my mother sure ted spinning mother around and shoving her at me mothers terrified eyes looking at me the gun going off lizzie borden had an axe are you all right mrs nolan henry paley is asking me yes of course i manage with some effort my tongue feels too heavy to mouth the words my mind is racing with the thought that i should not have let larry my first husband make me swear that i wouldnt tell the truth about myself to anyone not even to someone i married in this moment i am fiercely angry at larry for wringing that promise from me he had been so kind when i told him about myself before our marriage but in the end he failed me he was ashamed of my past afraid of the impact it might have on our sons future that fear has brought us here now already the lie is a wedge driven between alex and me we both feel it he talks about wanting to have children soon and i wonder how he would feel if he knew that little lizzie borden would be their mother its been twentyfour years but such memories die hard will anyone in town recognize me i wonder probably not but though i agreed to live in this area i did not agree to live in this town or in this house i cant live here i simply cant to avoid the curiosity in paleys eyes i walk over to the mantel and pretend to study it beautiful isnt it paley asks the professional enthusiasm of the real estate agent ringing through his somewhat highpitched voice yes it is the master bedroom is very large and has two separate wonderfully appointed baths he opens the door to the bedroom and looks expectantly at me reluctantly i follow him memories flood my mind weekend mornings in this room i used to get in bed with mother and daddy daddy would bring up coffee for mother and hot chocolate for me their kingsize bed with the tufted headboard is gone of course the soft peach walls are now painted dark green looking out the back windows i can see that the japanese maple tree daddy planted so long ago is now mature and beautiful tears are pressing against my eyelids i want to run out of here if necessary i will have to break my promise to larry and tell alex the truth about myself i am not celia foster nee kellogg the daughter of kathleen and martin kellogg of santa barbara california i am liza barton born in this town and as a child reluctantly acquitted by a judge of murder and attempted murder mom mom i hear my sons voice as his footsteps clatter on the uncarpeted floorboards he hurries into the room energy encapsulated small and sturdy a bright quickness about him a handsome little boy the center of my heart at night i steal into his room to listen to the sound of his even breathing he is not interested in what happened years ago he is satisfied if i am there to answer when he calls me as he reaches me i bend down and catch him in my arms jack has larrys light brown hair and high forehead his beautiful blue eyes are my mothers but then larry had blue eyes too in those last moments of fading consciousness larry had whispered that when jack attended his prep school he didnt want him to ever have to deal with the tabloids digging up those old stories about me i taste again the bitterness of knowing that his father was ashamed of me ted cartwright swears estranged wife begged for reconciliation state psychiatrist testifies tenyearold liza barton mentally competent to form the intent to commit murder was larry right to swear me to silence at this moment i cant be sure of anything i kiss the top of jacks head i really really really like it here he tells me excitedly alex is coming into the bedroom he planned this surprise for me with so much care when we came up the driveway it had been festooned with birthday balloons swaying on this breezy august day all painted with my name and the words happy birthday but the exuberant joy with which he handed me the key and the deed to the house is gone he can read me too well he knows im not happy he is disappointed and hurt and why wouldnt he be when i told the people at the office what id done a couple of the women said that no matter how beautiful a house might be theyd want to have the chance to make the decision about buying it he said his voice forlorn they were right i thought as i looked at him at his reddishbrown hair and brown eyes tall and wideshouldered alex has a look of strength about him that makes him enormously attractive jack adores him now jack slides from my arms and puts his arm around alexs leg my husband and my son and my house
