at that moment she couldnt think of a gracious way to bow out all right together they made their way to a large function room at the far end of the lobby the room was already nearly full of women all buzzing excitedly jane and elaine took seats near the back at the front of the room kara falcone rats charismatic president stood behind a podium gazing out at the audience kara a tall bigboned blonde

you all right oh sure im fine gotta call home make sure my son is all right and she jumped up and scooted out the door outside in the lobby it was mercifully tranquil since everyone at the convention was in that room listening to the long list of tina vales discoveries breathing in the lovely cool air jane caught the aroma of food cookingsteak it smelled like she realized she was hungry the convention dinner banquet would immediately follow tinas award ceremony which with any luck would be over soon jane made a mental note not to sit with bertha she delved into a new area of the lobbys jungle following a brick path around a cage containing two cockatiels she came out into a small treesheltered circle of brick on which sat a comfortablelooking loveseat and a coffee table perfect she breathed and settled into the loveseat looking about her she was pleased to discover that she was completely hidden from the lobby itself opening her purse she took out her compact checked her makeup and put on some more lipstick she gazed over at the cockatiels sitting silently on their perch from the room in which the award ceremony was taking place came kara falcones voice as if very far away and i can think of no one more deserving of the romance authors together lifetime achievement award ladies and gentlemen i am honored to present to you a titan of the romance world and a fine human being obviously kara didnt know her tina vale wild applause which seemed to go on forever before finally dying down jane waited for the sound of tinas voice thanking everyone instead there was an odd silence then came a murmur of many puzzled voices jane frowned what had happened she heard heels clicking on the tile of the lobby just behind her and turning on the loveseat parted two palm fronds to peer out two convention coordinators had emerged from the award room concerned expressions on their faces where do you think she is one asked the other who shrugged do you think she forgot forgot a lifetime achievement award no way something must be wrong a third woman appeared is she here the other two shook their heads ill go up to her suite to see if theres a problem she hurried off to the elevators jane settled back into the loveseat wasnt that just like tina to blow off her award it wasnt at all surprising really considering what she had just done to nat barreand jory mankewitzand salom sutton that list went on and on too behind her she heard more clacking of heels on tile as the murmur of voices in the award room grew louder she turned again and peeked out the coordinator who had gone up to tinas suite had reappeared and was speaking to the other two women i knocked on her door no answer did you knock loud of course i knocked loud shes not in there or if she is shes sound asleep what if shes sick or something the third woman looked at her clearly considering this possibility seriously you know she could be like i said no one would ever just forget she was getting this award i know what to do she marched over to the reception desk where andrew cowan the hotel manager busied himself behind two clerks the woman got his attention and spoke to him he listened an intense expression on his face then came out from behind the counter and followed her to the elevators they both went up together jane sat back down and rolled her eyes she giggled wait until the rats found out tina simply hadnt bothered to come down and claim her award she was probably doing her nails or balancing her checkbook approximately ten minutes passed before jane heard the elevator doors swoosh open she turned and resumed her spying the woman walked slowly out of the elevator a sickly expression on her face which had gone very pale immediately behind her was andrew cowan who was chewing on two fingernails at the same time call an ambulance the woman suddenly shrieked at him no the police cowan said and ran for the front desk an ambulance the police had tina been hurt stanley was probably still in the hotel jane called him on her cell phone and he answered instantly where are you she asked back in conference room d theyre still fighting i may have to have one of them arrested he joked stanley the hotel manager is calling the police why something about tina vale she made her way out of the sheltered circle back along the brick path and into the lobby proper at the far end stanley emerged from conference room d she waved to him and he waved back closing his phone and hurrying to the reception desk there he spoke with cowan for a moment before hurrying after him to the elevators jane stood waiting it felt like an eternity finally she could stand it no longer and called stanley again jane he said his voice grave i cant talk to you now tinas dead
