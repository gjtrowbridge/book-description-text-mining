quotyoure giving me too much credit that wasnt funnyquot harriet didnt smile quoti rarely think youre funnyquot quotthere goes my dream of doing standupquot quotlets talk about the day you and claire were separatedquot meghann shifted uncomfortably in her seat just when she needed a smartass response her mind went blank she knew what harriet was poking around for and harriet knew she knew if meghann didnt answer the question would simply be asked again quotseparated a nice clean word detached i like it but that subject is closedquot quotits interesting that you maintain a relationship with your mother while distancing yourself from your sisterquot meghann shrugged quotmamas an actress im a lawyer were comfortable with makebelievequot quotmeaningquot quothave you ever read one of her interviewsquot quotnoquot quotshe tells everyone that we lived this poor patheticbutloving existence we pretend its the truthquot quotyou were living in bakersfield when the patheticbutloving pretense ended rightquot meghann remained silent harriet had maneuvered her back to the painful subject like a rat through a maze harriet went on quotclaire was nine years old she was missing several teeth if i remember correctly and she was having difficulties with mathquot quotdontquot meghann curled her fingers around the chairs sleek wooden arms harriet stared at her beneath the unruly black ledge of her eyebrows her gaze was steady small round glasses magnified her eyes quotdont back away meg were making progressquot quotany more progress and ill need an aid car we should talk about my

feeling of isolation an awareness that people are upset by your actions or missing you okay lets talk about that dream who is cryingquot quotshitquot meghann should have seen that after all she had an undergraduate degree in psychology not to mention the fact that shed once been called a child prodigy she glanced down at her platinum and gold watch quottoo bad harriet times up i guess well have to solve my pesky neuroses next weekquot she stood up smoothed the pant legs of her navy armani suit not that there was a wrinkle to be found harriet slowly removed her glasses meghann crossed her arms in an instinctive gesture of selfprotection quotthis should be goodquot quotdo you like your life meghannquot that wasnt what shed expected quotwhats not to like im the best divorce attorney in the state i livequot quotalonequot quotin a kickass condo above the public market and drive a brandnew porschequot quotfriendsquot quoti talk to elizabeth every thursday nightquot quotfamilyquot maybe it

the colonization of mars on mtvquot quotand clairequot quotmy sister and i have problems ill admit it but nothing major were just too busy to get togetherquot when harriet didnt speak meghann rushed in to fill the silence quotokay she makes me crazy the way shes throwing her life away shes smart enough to do anything but she stays tied to that loser campground they call a resortquot quotwith her fatherquot quoti dont want to discuss my sister and i definitely dont want to discuss her fatherquot harriet tapped her pen on the table quotokay how about this when was the last time you slept with the same man twicequot quotyoure the only one who thinks thats a bad thing i like varietyquot quotthe way you like younger men right men who have no desire to settle down you get rid of them before

better start hanging out in gyms instead of barsquot quotand strong women face their fears they talk about the painful choices theyve made in their livesquot meghann actually flinched quotsorry harriet i need to scoot see you next weekquot she left the office outside it was a gloriously bright june day early in the socalled summer everywhere else in the country people were swimming and barbecuing and organizing poolside picnics here in good ole seattle people were methodically checking their calendars and muttering that it was june damn it only a few tourists were around this morning outoftowners recognizable by the umbrellas tucked under their arms meghann finally released her breath as she crossed the busy street and stepped up onto the grassy lawn of the waterfront park a towering totem pole greeted her behind it a dozen seagulls dived for bits of discarded food she walked past a park bench where a man lay huddled beneath a blanket of yellowed newspapers in front of her the deep blue sound stretched along the pale horizon she wished she could take comfort from that view often she could but today her mind was caught in the net of another time and place if she closed her eyeswhich she definitely dared not doshed remember it all the dialing of the telephone number the stilted desperate conversation with a man she didnt know the long silent drive to that shitass little town up north and worst of all the tears shed wiped from her little sisters flushed cheeks when she said im leaving you claire her fingers tightened around the railing dr bloom was wrong talking about meghanns painful choice and the lonely years that had followed it wouldnt help her past wasnt a collection of memories to be worked through it was like an oversize samsonite with a bum wheel meghann had learned that a long time ago all she could do was drag it along behind her each november the mighty skykomish river strained against its muddy banks the threat of flooding was a yearly event in a dance as old as time itself the people who lived in the tiny towns along the river watched and waited sandbags at the ready their memory went back for generations everyone had a story to tell about the time the water rose to the second floor of soandsos house to the top of the doorways at the grange hall to the corner of spring and azalea streets people who lived in flatter safer places watched the nightly news and shook their heads clucking about the ridiculousness of farmers who lived on the flood plain when the river finally began to lower a collective sigh of relief ran through town it usually started with emmett mulvaney the pharmacist who religiously watched the weather channel on haydens only bigscreen television he would notice some tiny tidbit of information something even those hotshot meteorologists in seattle had missed hed pass his assessment on to sheriff dick parks who told his secretary martha in less time than it took to drive from one end of town to the other the word spread this year is going to be okay the danger has passed sure enough twentyfour hours after emmetts prediction the meteorologists agreed this year had been no exception but now on this beautiful early summers day it was easy to forget those dangerous months in which rainfall made everyone crazy claire cavenaugh stood on the banks on the river her work boots almost ankledeep in the soft brown mud beside her an outofgas weed eater lay on its side she smiled wiped a gloved hand across her sweaty brow the amount of manual labor it took to get the resort ready for summer was unbelievable resort that was what her dad called these sixteen acres sam cavenaugh had come across this acreage almost forty years ago back when hayden had been nothing more than a gas station stop on the rise up stevens pass hed bought the parcel for a song and settled into the decrepit farmhouse that came with it hed named his place rivers edge resort and begun to dream of a life that didnt include hard hats and earplugs and night shifts at the paper plant in everett at first hed worked after hours and weekends with a chain saw a pickup truck and a plan drawn out on a cocktail napkin he began he hacked out campsites and cleaned out a hundred years worth of underbrush and built each knotty pine riverfront cabin by hand now rivers edge was a thriving family business there were eight cabins in all each with two pretty little bedrooms and a single bathroom and a deck that overlooked the river in the past few years theyd added a swimming pool and a game room plans for a mini golf course and a laundromat were in the works it was the kind of place where the same families came back year after year to spend their precious vacation time claire still remembered the first time shed seen it the towering trees and rushing silver river had seemed like paradise to a girl raised in a trailer that only stopped on the poor side of town her childhood memories before coming to rivers edge were gray ugly towns that came and went uglier apartments in rundown buildings and mama always on the run from something or other mama had been married repeatedly but claire couldnt remember a man ever being around for longer than a carton of milk meghann was the one claire remembered the older sister who took care of everything and then walked away one day leaving claire behind now all these years later their lives were connected by the thinnest of strands once every few months she and meg talked on the phone on particularly bad days they fell to talking about the weather then meg would invariably quotget another callquot and hang up her sister loved to underscore how successful she was meghann could rattle on for ten minutes about how claire had sold herself short quotliving on that silly little campground cleaning up after peoplequot was the usual wording every single christmas she offered to pay for college as if reading beowulf would improve claires life for years claire had longed to be friends as well as sisters but meghann didnt want that and meghann always got her way they were what meghann wanted them to be polite strangers who shared a blood type and an ugly childhood claire reached down for the weed eater as she slogged across the spongy ground she noticed a dozen things that needed to be done before opening day roses that needed to be trimmed moss that needed to be scraped off the roofs mildew that needed to be bleached off the porch railings and there was the mowing a long wet winter had turned into a surprisingly bright spring and the grass had grown as tall as claires knees she made a mental note to ask george their handyman to scrub out the canoes and kayaks this afternoon she tossed the weed eater in the back of the pickup it hit with a clanging thunk that rattled the rusted bed quothey sweetie you goin to townquot she turned and saw her father standing on the porch of the registration building he wore a ratty pair of overalls stained brown down the bib from some longforgotten oil change and flannel shirt he pulled a red bandanna out of his hip pocket and wiped his brow as he walked toward her quotim fixing that freezer by the way dont you go pricing new onesquot there wasnt an appliance made he couldnt repair but claire was going to check out prices just the same quotyou need anything from townquot quotsmitty has a part for me could you pick it upquot quotyou bet and have george start on the canoes when he gets here okayquot quotill put it on the listquot quotand have teena bleach the bathroom ceiling in cabin six it got mildewy this winterquot she closed the pickups bed quotyou here for dinnerquot quotnot tonight ali has a tee ball game at riverfront park remember five oclockquot quotoh yeah ill be therequot claire nodded knowing that he would he hadnt missed a single event in his granddaughters life quotbye dadquot she wrenched the trucks door handle and yanked hard the door screeched open she grabbed the black steering wheel and climbed up into the seat dad thumped the trucks door quotdrive safely watch the turn at milepost sevenquot she smiled hed been giving her that exact bit of advice for almost two decades quoti love you dadquot quoti love you too now go get my granddaughter if you hurry well have time to watch spongebob squarepants before the gamequot chapter two the west side of the office building faced puget sound a wall of floortoceiling windows framed the beautiful bluewashed view in the distance lay the forested mound of bainbridge island at night a few lights could be seen amid all that black and green darkness in the daylight though the island looked uninhabited only the white ferry chugging into its dock every hour indicated that people lived there
