 cornwall england may 1275 he entered the place slowly his footsteps hesitant now that he had breached the threshold after so long an absence from his father8217s house he was not at all sure he would be welcome he doubted he would be heard but embraced or nay his heart was heavy and he knew of nowhere else to lay his burdens the blame here however was wholly his own he reckoned he would carry that for the rest of his days fine silver spurs rode at the heels of his boots ticking softly on the smooth stone floor as he advanced their tinny music the only disturbance of sound in the vacant chamber unwarmed unlit save for the hazy overcast glare that washed in through a high arched window the vaulted space held the cool stillness of a tomb fitting he thought his eyes yet burning from the sight that had greeted him upon his arrival for a moment as he reached the end of his path the knight could only stand there his limbs leaden from his days of travel his throat scorched and dry like the bitter chalk of ash golden head bowed he closed his eyes and sank to his knees on the floor 8220pater noster qui es in caelis 8221 the prayer fell from his lips by rote familiar as his own name kenrick of clairmont had said this prayer a thousand times nay countless repetitions8212a hundred times a day for seven days straight as was required every time one of his templar brethren had fallen although he was no longer of the order he wanted to believe that where his vow was broken some scrap of his faith might still remain the prayer he recited now was for a friend and that man8217s family for randwulf of greycliff and the wife and young son who once lived in this place each breath kenrick drew to speak held the cloying tang of smoke and cinder soot blackened the floor of the chapel where he knelt as it did the walls of the small tower keep beyond the place was in ruin all of it dead and cold some weeks before he had arrived rand and his cherished family gone kenrick needed not question why or whom the annihilation bore the stamp of silas de mortaine the man who had held him hostage in a rouen dungeon for nigh on half a year and surely would have killed him anon had it not been for his daring rescue a few months ago kenrick found it hard to maintain his relief at that thought now while he was recuperating from his torture rand and his loved ones were meeting a hellish end all because of him all because of a secret pact he had shared with his friend and brotherinarms a pledge sealed more than a year ago at this humble cornish manor near land8217s end god8217s blood if he had known what it would cost rand he never would have sought his help 8220 sed libera nos a malo 8221 too late he thought bitter with grief and remorse de mortaine8217s evil was inescapable his grasp was farreaching he was a menacing force a wealthy man who dealt in dark magic and commanded a small army of mercenary beasts to assist him in his malevolent goals he wanted the dragon chalice a legendary treasure of mystical origins kenrick had stumbled upon the chalice tales in his work for the order in truth he had thought it mere myth until he had held part of the fabled treasure in his hands and witnessed the astonishing breadth of its powers the dragon chalice was real and the carnage here was merely one more demonstration of silas de mortaine8217s intent to claim the chalice for his own for kenrick of clairmont who still bore the scars of his incarceration the travesty surrounding him at rand8217s keep was further proof of why he could not allow de mortaine to win not at any cost 8220amen8221 he growled then brought himself to his feet in the charred nave of the chapel for a moment he allowed his gaze to settle on the wreckage of the place at the modest gold crucifix hanging above the altar unscathed he bit back the wry curse that rose to his tongue but only barely not even god could stop de mortaine from visiting his wrath on these noble folk a mild blasphemy to think such a thing particularly in a place of worship all the worse that it should come from a man once sworn into god8217s service first as a novitiate monk then later as a knight of the temple of solomon 8220saint8221 was what rand and his friends had often called kenrick in their youth a name given in jest for his rigid nobility and scholarly ways but those days were long past he would waste no further time dwelling on old memories than he would now afford his grief there would be time for both once his business here was concluded as eager as he had been to arrive earlier that day now he longed to be away his scalp itched beneath the cropped cut of his hair a lingering reminder of his captivity when his head and beard had crawled with lice he had cut it all away at first chance preferring to be cleanshaven daily his dark blond hair kept shorter than was stylish curling just above the collar of his brown tunic and gambeson he scratched at his nape cursing the bitter reminder on second thought he reflected pivoting sharply perhaps the niggling crawl of his scalp had more to do with the sudden feeling he had that he was not alone in the abandoned keep there seemed a mild disturbance in the stillness of the air as though someone8212or something8212breathed amid the death that permeated the place outside in the yard one of the townsfolk who had witnessed the carnage waited with kenrick8217s mount the graybeard8217s portly form had not moved from where he stood still kenrick felt eyes on him surreptitiously watching waiting 8220who is there8221 he called the low command echoing hollowly off the vaulted walls no one answered his sharp blue gaze flicked into every shadowed corner quickly assessing his surroundings nothing stirred nothing met his eye but cold stone and vacant silence the chapel like the adjacent tower keep was empty he was alone here after all that there were few around to meet him when he arrived nary a peasant or neighbor willing to come forth and speak with him about what they might have witnessed would have seemed unsettling had this not been cornwall folk were different in this farflung end of the realm they kept to their own affairs and they were not in the habit of welcoming strangers it had required a sizable fee to convince the man outside to provide his account of what had happened at the keep a fortnight past kenrick8217s head still rang with the terrible details a band of raiders attacking the small manor in the night the screams of women and children plumes of fire and smoke as the keep was set ablaze its inhabitants locked inside he swore aloud cursing himself and the uncaring god who had allowed this to happen rage churned in his gut as he quit the chapel for the yard outside the old townsman looked at him as he approached and somberly shook his head 8220like i told you m8217lord 8217twere an awful thing hard to think of anyone who might wish to harm sir randwulf and his family kind as they were naught anyone could do about it though whoever attacked this place came and went like ghosts in the dead of night i don8217t reckon the poor souls had a chance8221 kenrick said nothing as he strode farther into the court struck anew by the decimation he paused only a moment unable to prevent his eyes from straying across the scorched spring grass and muddy yard to where a child8217s toy cart lay overturned and broken a memory flitted through his mind rand8217s son laughing as he tugged the painted wooden wagon behind him fast as his fiveyearold legs could carry him elspeth was there too rand8217s pretty wife waving to the three men8212rand kenrick and jubilant tod8212as they passed her in the sunlit gardens of the keep it had been the last he had seen of rand and his family he had come there to enlist his friend8217s help instead he had delivered their death warrant 8220stay here8221 kenrick ordered the old man not wishing to hear any more of what rand and his family suffered 8220i wish to be alone for a while8221 8220as you will m8217lord8221 the solitude would suit him well in his next task kenrick admitted as he drew his dagger from the sheath at his belt above him now the sky had turned from dull overcast to a mass of dark gathering clouds it would not be long before the cool sprinkle of rain that misted his face and bare hands would worsen to a downpour he needed no better excuse to be quick about his work and have done with this place walking briskly kenrick left the courtyard and headed around the side of the chapel a small cemetery plot huddled in the shade of the westerly wall the graves of rand8217s forebears8212thieves scoundrels and whores greycliff would admit with a reckless grin8212lay burrowed beneath the staggered row of a dozen granite markers three oblong patches of raised brown earth indicated the newest additions to the plot if rand8217s neighbors avoided the place now at least someone had taken care to see the slain family was properly laid to rest thinking on that somber event knowing who lay buried under the damp mounds kenrick swallowed back a fierce wave of regret he entered the cemetery with reverent care treading softly his gaze searching out a squat pillar of chiseled stone near the back of the place where the oldest of the graves were located he had taken only a few steps when his spur clinked on something metallic beneath his boot a pendant necklace he realized stooping down to retrieve it from the mossy ground it was elspeth8217s he had never seen her without it dangling from around her delicate neck the chain was broken now the pendant dirtied from its time in the elements she would despair of its loss even in death for it had been a gift from her husband kenrick palmed the simple piece fisting his hand around the cool metal it belonged with rand8217s wife it seemed the least he could do to repair the crushed golden chain and bring the necklace back as he loosened the drawstring of his baldric pouch he heard a rustle of movement somewhere nearby or perhaps it had only been the rain which was pattering down a little harder than before slapping gently on the rounded tops of the gravestones he slipped the pendant into the pouch and stood up pivoting to make certain the old man hadn8217t followed him no one was there only stillness as it had been in the chapel the dagger he held felt cool and heavy in his hand the sword sheathed at his hip an added measure of security he was fully prepared to use in his fury over what had befallen his friends kenrick almost wished he would encounter silas de mortaine on this scorched plot of land his palms itched to deliver unholy vengeance but first the task at hand kenrick stalked to the lichenspotted marker at the far end of the cemetery and crouched down before it with the point of his dagger he found the hidden cleft in the chiseled design offshape no bigger than a child8217s palm the secret compartment was disguised by the scrollwork and lettering hammered into the granite ages ago rand and he were not the first ones to make use of it one of the early greycliff brides had employed the marker to receive communiqu233s and gifts from a royal lover now the stone held a secret of a far more dangerous sort kenrick dug the sharp tip of the blade into the seam of the compartment working the slender edge of steel around until the piece began to loosen the granite rasped as it gave way inch by inch the final corner pried loose kenrick eased the wedge of stone out into his palm and gazed at the small compartment it revealed 8220god8217s blood8221 he exhaled the oath tossing down his dagger and narrowly resisting the urge to drive his fist into the slab of granite before him it wasn8217t there the shallow hiding place carved into the tombstone which had contained a folded square of parchment when he had sealed it up a year ago was empty he stared into that vacant space a thousand questions8212a thousand dire possibilities8212roiling in his head who had found the seal how did they know where to look how long had it been gone would they know how to use it what to do with it and perhaps more crucial now that it appeared he had lost it how could he go about finishing his quest without it as it stood he wouldn8217t have much time it had taken him several years to realize precisely what he had uncovered to understand the importance of protecting it from those who would use it for their own gain countless days and nights he had spent toiling with his journals and ledgers sifting out every fact from the troves of fiction buried within decades of dusty records and reportings of the order 8220christ on the cross how can this be8221 the final key to his discovery enveloped within a single sheaf of parchment now likely resided in the hands of his enemies he had not come this far survived all he had only to fail here and now nor would he permit rand and his family to have died in vain placing the dislodged wafer of chiseled granite back in place on the grave marker kenrick pushed to his feet from the corner of his eye he caught an unmistakable flicker of movement his head snapped up his gaze cutting sharply over his shoulder damn it he was being watched a fleeting splash of color moved near the wall of the chapel too late to fully escape his notice this time kenrick caught a momentary glimpse of pale white skin and wary wide green eyes a mere blink was all the time she paused8212just long enough for kenrick to register the delicacy of the woman8217s heartshaped face which was caught in an expression of startlement as she looked back at him in that frozen instant a drooping mane of unbound auburn hair framed her striking countenance the rich russetred tangles glowing like fire against the persistent gray of the morning she was plainly garbed a commoner by her modest attire of cloak and kirtle but hardly plain of face or form as tense as he was his blood seething over the loss of his friends and the prized item he sought kenrick was not immune to the beauty of this unexpected intruder indeed he was tempted to stare having found such incongruous beauty amid the smoldering ruins his observer seemed in no mind to afford him the chance her eyes lit on the dagger still clutched in his fist then she lunged quick as a sprite dashing behind the front wall of the chapel 8220stop8221 he ordered knowing he would be ignored and already vaulting to his feet in pursuit he ran around to the corner of the small church his spurs chewing up the soft earth his weaponry jangling with each heavy bootfall his quarry was far lighter of foot simply there one moment and gone the next into the chapel he had to presume for there were few places to hide and there was no sign of her in the yard or on the gently rolling field beyond the keep 8220where did she go8221 8220eh8221 the old townsman looked up with a start as kenrick thundered into the bailey peering at him from over his grazing horse8217s head 8220she m8217lord8221 8220the woman8212where is she8221 the graybeard looked to and fro then shrugged his rounded shoulders 8220i8217ve seen no one a8217tall m8217lord8221 8220you must have seen something she was spying on me in the graveyard and ran this way not a moment ago you must have heard her footsteps at the very least8221 8220nay sir 8217twasn8217t no one come through here in a fortnight save the both of us i saw nothing i assure you8221 kenrick swore under his breath he was not imagining things surely a woman had been there watching him with stealthy strides he approached the open doorway to the chapel the only place she could have gone 8220show yourself you have nothing to fear8221 he said stepping into the vaulted chamber 8220come out now i wish only to talk to you8221 the barest shift of sound came from a toppled cabinet to his right the door to the piece hung askew on its hinges too small to hide but a child yet it afforded the sole spot of concealment in all of the chapel from the darkened wedge of space at the top kenrick saw the glint of a wary stare watching him as he approached 8220who are you8221 he asked coming to stand there he wished not to frighten the chit but he wanted answers needed them 8220what do you know of this place8221 when no reply came he reached out with his booted foot and began to move aside the broken door of the cabinet to reveal its cowering occupant there was a whine then a fearful animal growl as he bent down to peer inside 8220jesu criste8221 it was not his stealthy observer after all a small red fox glared at him with hackles raised and teeth bared trapped between the unyielding back of the cabinet enclosure and the daggerwielding man who blocked its easy escape the instant kenrick withdrew the little beast dashed out and fled the chapel for the safety of the outlying moors kenrick turned and watched it go letting out his anxiety in a long heavy sigh where had she gone whoever the woman was she had managed to vanish into thin air he was tempted to think as he scanned his surroundings and saw no trace of the lovely intruder 8220i wager it don8217t take long for the animals to come nosing about when there8217s no one here to shoo them off8221 said the graybeard from the village he clucked his tongue as he ambled forward to where kenrick stood 8220nothing of worth in this place for anyone now man or beast they burnt it all save the stone of the keep and chapel sorrow is all that dwells here8221 maybe so kenrick thought unable to argue that the destruction of the place had been as thorough as it had been brutal but there was something else lurking here too something beyond the death and cinder and far more elusive than an errant forest scavenger hoping to root out its next meal from among the ruins that particular something had a riot of long rich red hair and the most beautiful face kenrick had ever beheld and as sure as he had seen her wherever she8217d run to he was certain she hadn8217t gone far
