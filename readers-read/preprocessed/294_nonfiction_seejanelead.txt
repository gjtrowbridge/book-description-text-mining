 the day will come when man will recognize woman as his peer not only at the fireside but in councils of the nation then and not until then will there be the perfect comradeship the ideal union between the sexes that shall result in the highest development of the race 8212susan b anthony people often ask me how i choose the subject matter for my books i tell them it always comes from having such a burning desire to share something with others that if i didn8217t i would feel my life8217s mission was not complete that8217s precisely why i wrote this book i believe we live in a time when women8217s leadership and influence aren8217t just needed8212they8217re required more important i know that women have the capability strength courage and heart to lead communities businesses nonprofit organizations and grassroots groups to places they need to go they8217ve done it for centuries you may not think you have much in common with avon8217s president andrea jung or former director of the red cross elizabeth dole but this book will help you to see that you do8212and that if ever there was a time your leadership was needed the time is now you also may not aspire to be a ceo vice president or director of an organization but chances are you find yourself in a position where you want to influence others that8217s leadership you may be responsible for a small committee of the pta that8217s leadership or you might have ideas that contribute to creating change in an organization of which you are a member that8217s leadership too women lead all the time8212they just don8217t call it leadership they think of it as working toward a common goal achieving results through people or simply doing what needs to be done in fact that8217s what leadership is all about a woman8217s way of leading hasn8217t always been valued but there8217s a change occurring in society that people are hesitant to talk about it8217s what i call the feminization of leadership to discuss it openly would mean challenging how we have traditionally looked at leadership8212and followership it would also require embracing a concept that many people find threatening commandandcontrol topdown leadership no longer works when someone in authority says 8220jump8221 employees children and volunteers no longer reply 8220how high8221 the truth is what followers expect from leaders in the first decade of the twentyfirst century8212and perhaps beyond8212are the behaviors and characteristics that women have traditionally been socialized to exhibit throughout history with little or no formal authority women have influenced direction change and outcomes8212they were simply never so bold as to call it leadership it doesn8217t mean that men can8217t or don8217t display these qualities but rather that women tend to do so with greater ease confidence and comfort8212so long as it8217s not called the lword leadership the changing face of leadership is threatening to men because it requires thinking about the subject in a way that is counter to their own socialization and in some cases education similarly women may feel threatened because it asks them to assume responsibility in ways they may never have before and to call attention to skills they have been admonished to hide 8220nice girls8221 have a particularly difficult time assuming leadership roles and doing it effectively when they do they often try to make everyone happy which as you know is impossible delay decision making by trying to get everyone8217s buyin hesitate to take necessary risks for fear of offending the powers that be and communicate in ways that undermine their confidence and credibility ironically each of these behaviors could work to the advantage of women8212if only they would balance them with new behaviors that contribute to more effective leadership in other words stepping fully away from the nicegirl messages learned in childhood and into adulthood is all it would take for a woman to be a phenomenal leader for this age of course that8217s one giant step society has done both men and women a disservice by placing the onus of leadership responsibility squarely on the shoulders of men it makes men reluctant to admit when they feel incapable of or ineffectual at leadership and women reluctant to openly suggest that they might be able to do a better job of it nonetheless we are at a turning point where both genders will have to become more comfortable with assuming roles they have traditionally rejected this turning point is caused by evolving worker attitudes and values that women are best suited to address just as women have in the past had to learn from men how to manage using styles that did not come naturally to them men will now have to learn from women the ways of bringing out the best in today8217s workforce despite the fact that american productivity continues to decline most major corporations continue to be led almost exclusively by white males a recent study conducted by catalyst this country8217s premier women8217s research group reports that although women make up 464 percent of the labor force only seven fortune 500 ceos are women women constitute only 52 percent of the top earners and hold only 79 percent of the highest titles in these companies sources current population survey annual averages 2004 catalyst 2003 catalyst census of women board directors catalyst 2002 catalyst census of women corporate offi cers and top earners turning to politics as of january 2006 only 15 percent of all elected representatives to the us congress were women of those women 24 percent are women of color but they all serve in the house of representatives with no women of color serving in the senate this is fairly consistent with the average of 16 percent of women holding seats in parliaments around the world out of 180 countries only 11 have women heads of state what8217s missing at the top is not just a female perspective but a broad diversity of opinions and skills paradoxically when those who possess power and control are threatened by circumstance they are inclined to hold even tighter to their authority when status quo is thus maintained organizations and societies lose with diversity however comes the promise of positive change as shown by another catalyst study this one that found companies with the most women in senior management positions had a 35 percent higher return on equity and a 34 percent higher total return to shareholders similarly the law firm dickstein shapiro reports that in 1994 when it had 63 women attorneys out of 213 profit per partner was 364000 annually in 2004 when the number of women had grown to 122 out of 363 attorneys the perpartner profit had increased to 815000 linda kornfeld and robin cohen attorneys with dickstein shapiro say they believe women leaders are making great contributions for the following reasons 8226nbspnbspwomen executives are more likely to consult with others8212experts employees and fellow business owners8212when developing strategies 8226nbspnbspwomen executives have a greater natural tendency to deal comfortably with multitasking 8226nbspnbspwomen executives have fewer competitive tendencies and often seek a more collaborative approach 8226nbspnbspwomen executives tend to focus on the big picture when making important business decisions or developing strategies 8226nbspnbspwomen executives stress relationship building as well as fact gathering 8226nbspnbspwomen executives are more likely to talk through business approaches and incorporate the ideas of others before making final decisions these and other factors combine to make me conclude that women have not only the ability to become great leaders for our time but also the responsibility to do so just as women are entrusted with the primary responsibility for bearing and raising the next generation they have a similar responsibility to ensure that the systems and institutions upon which the next generation will rely are strong and healthy women must cease colluding with those who either subconsciously or systematically deny them inclusion eleanor roosevelt once said 8220no one can make you feel inferior without your consent8221 when you allow others to do this you collude with them to remain in an inferior position instead women must come to understand how to maximize the use of their natural gifts within a system that tries to deny the value and necessity of these gifts a formidable task but none too difficult for a group that for centuries has relied on its wits and inner strength to triumph over discrimination and oppression why nice girls don8217t lead most workshops that i conduct include a module on collaborative problem solving it8217s videotaped and played back so that participants can see themselves as others see them the instructions given in advance ask participants to wait until the camera is on before they begin work on the problem with only two exceptions in nearly twenty years after the camera begins recording the first person to speak has been a man regardless of seniority or expertise women are reticent to take the lead the reasons for this are as different as women themselves when they do exhibit leader behaviors particularly when they do so before being asked they face a wide array of subtle and notsosubtle reactions8212from both men and women included among the reactions with which they are forced to contend 8226nbspnbspbeing called names usually behind their backs that assault their femininity 8226nbspnbspanger that is expressed blatantly or passiveaggressively 8226nbspnbsphaving their ideas openly challenged rather than built on 8226nbspnbsphaving their ideas overlooked only to be repeated as original by men in the group 8226nbspnbspbeing excluded from future meetings 8226nbspnbsphaving information that enables them to make good judgments withheld 8226nbspnbspchallenges to their 8220right8221 to lead ie 8220who does she think she is8221 8226nbspnbsplater being given more menial assignments that are designed to keep them in their place 8226nbspnbspbeing placated 8226nbspnbspbeing openly derided in the face of such negative reactions it8217s no wonder that women are reluctant to lead this is what makes it so important for women to consciously view these reactions as natural responses to a system trying to maintain status quo and not to collude with them in the 1977 classic games mother never taught you corporate gamesmanship for women betty lehan harragan used masculine metaphors and definitions to help women better understand how to win the game of business although groundbreaking at the time the book set the stage for women to assume that they inherently lacked knowledge or skills to compete on the corporate playing field subsequent books followed suit and soon the very essence of the woman leader was lost in assertiveness training tailored suits with little bow ties for a time and sports jargon as a result women chose to hide their natural abilities and instead attempted to emulate the highervalued behaviors associated with the masculine style of leadership i was honored when dr judy rosener professor emerita of the university of california8211irvine8217s paul merage school of business graciously agreed to speak with me about this in 1990 dr rosener wrote an article for the harvard business review titled 8220ways women lead8221 although she8217s written many books and articles since this piece represents the seminal thoughts on the topic of women and leadership she was ahead of the curve then and she still is that article was the first to suggest that women possess a different style of leadership from men8212but one that8217s equally effective she shifted the thinking for many of us from i have to be more like a man to succeed as a leader to the skills i bring to the workplace whether developed by nature or nurture have intrinsic value judy wrote 8220women8217s success shows that a nontraditional leadership style is wellsuited to the conditions of some work environments and can increase an organization8217s chances of surviving in an uncertain world8221 when i had the chance to interview her sixteen years after the article8217s publication i was anxious to get her thoughts about how things have changed in the intervening years here8217s what she shared with me the biggest difference today is that women no longer believe that to be a leader is to be a male my article provided some 8220aha8221 moments for women so that they now believe that in a fastchanging highly technological globalized environment there are certain attributes that are particularly effective that they happen to exhibit women are far more comfortable doing what they do naturally and less comfortable with being trained to be like men that8217s why women are leaving corporations and starting their own businesses flexibility collaboration and multitasking are things women do well because of either socialization or nature women today have moved from a 8220fittingin8221 model to succeed they have to fit in to an 8220organizational fit8221 model which means i8217m going to join an organization where what i do is valued and rewarded it may be subconscious but the women i talk to constantly are transitioning they don8217t want to change to be successful women have to know and understand the environment in which they work but not think that their leadership skills present a problem because they8217re not the problem i agree wholeheartedly in the past women who did not want to sublimate their natural abilities were left with three options 1 remain silent and in nonleadership positions 2 leave corporate america to start their own businesses or 3 leave business entirely8212to parent retire teach what have you although businesses are slowly and somewhat reluctantly beginning to embrace this notion of a different but equal leadership style the result continues to be a migration of women leaders away from business at the very time when their skills are required to better understand how to improve productivity and morale option 2 starting their own businesses is increasingly being exercised with the number of womenowned companies growing at twice the rate of all businesses between 1997 and 2002 they contribute more than 28 trillion in revenues to the us economy and employ in excess of 92 million people women can and must combine their socialization and natural instincts to provide the kind of leadership necessary to unleash a wider array of individual and team gifts than are present in today8217s workplace it8217s simply a matter of harnessing their talents reframing them in a way that they can be better showcased and augmenting them with complementary behaviors to provide a wellrounded and muchneeded approach to the business of leadership why women and why now leaders can be successful only insofar as they accurately and adequately respond to the immediate needs of their followers in other words you must be a leader for your time it has been suggested that generals george s patton and norman schwarzkopf could not have been interchanged the needs of the troops dramatically shifted during the fortyyear interim between world war ii and the gulf war whereas patton8217s commandandcontrol style would most likely have been received with resistance by gulf war troops schwarzkopf8217s tendency to listen carefully to the suggestions and needs of others before making decisions might have been perceived as indecisive or soft by world war ii soldiers on the business front and technology aside it is highly doubtful that in this day and age tom watson sr could successfully build the giant we know as ibm or that henry ford could pioneer automobile manufacturing achieving their respective visions was possible only because they understood the needs of their followers at the time watson8217s fullemployment policy was designed to appeal to the insecurities of workers during the depression he knew that allowing everyone to work albeit on reduced schedules rather than laying people off would secure their loyalty during more prosperous times henry ford8217s automation of the manufacturing process provided a kind of financial stability within a hierarchical framework that workers of his day craved both men accurately read the employment climate and used it to their advantage similarly i seriously doubt that ronald reagan could have been elected in place of fdr or that mary kay ash could have successfully started and marketed her product at the turn of the twentieth century both these leaders were successful in their quests only because they understood the social climate and needs of their followers at the time the same holds true in society today bringing out the best in people is a far different game than it was even ten years ago the reasons for this shift in worker expectations are varied and complex they include the effects of a decade of downsizing technological advances shifts in workforce demographics changes in societal patterns such as increased numbers of divorces and singleparent families and globalization combined they create a scenario in which reliance on the traditional paradigms of command and control management over leadership and position power no longer work the demise of commandandcontrol leadership the days of commandandcontrol leadership are long gone this style was characterized by blind adherence to strict rules a rigidly defined and topdown hierarchical chain of command and an emphasis on winning at any cost workers would respond to management demands or directives simply because they believed that the people usually men in authority deserved to be respected it was born out of a masculine military model that assumed that those who possessed no formal authority had no real purpose other than to carry out the directives of management although commandandcontrol leadership was the preferred style for the better part of the last century it has for the most part outlived its usefulness even in paramilitary organizations such as fire departments police forces and other emergency operations commandandcontrol management is of limited use the primary way in which it continues to be valuable is during times of extreme emergency when it works it provides a model by which everyone can operate with maximum efficiency when it doesn8217t however you wind up with a situation similar to what we witnessed in the aftermath of hurricane katrina confusion lack of real leadership an unclear chain of command and finger pointing rather than problem solving and when it does work it works only for the moment commandandcontrol leadership does nothing to improve morale or productivity during nonemergency situations which is an important issue that paramilitary organizations are being forced to examine more carefully when considering how to motivate their increasingly diverse workforces the commandandcontrol model worked up until now for a number of reasons 8226nbspnbspthe workforce primarily white male understood and respected the hierarchy 8226nbspnbspmanufacturing the country8217s economic engine lent itself to using the model 8226nbspnbspyears of war and the threat of war enabled men and women alike to easily comprehend the bounds of command and control 8226nbspnbspa relatively uneducated workforce allowed itself to be governed by the belief that those in authority knew best 8226nbspnbspwomen and people of color were hesitant to challenge the model for fear of losing hardwon gains in this day of highly skilled and educated workers in which information technology telecommuting and flat organizations abound command and control simply doesn8217t work people don8217t want to be told what to do when to do it and how it should be done not only do they not want it they won8217t allow it managers who continue to rely on the style and there are many more of those around than you might expect are met with subversive compliance people doing exactly as they are told and finding nonverbal ways to sabotage the process consider the following examples 8226nbspnbspjim the manager of accounting tells jan an accounting clerk to prepare a report in a particular way jan tries to tell jim that doing it this way doesn8217t take into consideration several key factors but jim8217s commandandcontrol style precludes him from listening jan dutifully prepares the report as she was told when jim makes a presentation to management jan knows full well that jim won8217t be able to answer certain questions without the additional data that she suggested instead of discussing it again with jim jan thinks if this is what you want this is what you get and allows jim to be illprepared and embarrassed in front of his management 8226nbspnbsptrey is a new pc salesperson at a local electronics store during his training period he politely suggests adding several services to ensure customer satisfaction that go beyond what the store currently provides kristen his commandandcontrol manager instructs him in no uncertain terms to do it her way or face possibly failing the store8217s probationary period several weeks later when a customer asks for services that he had suggested but kristen rejected trey refers him to a competitor he knows who does provide those services 8226nbspnbspbarbara is the manager of administration for a prestigious law firm she has repeatedly tried to influence bill the firm8217s managing partner to revise outdated policies related to compensation and benefits for the administrative staff commandandcontrol bill refuses to budge believing that working for the firm is privilege enough when staff members apply for positions outside the firm barbara willingly gives glowing recommendations so that they can move on to more lucrative assignments while the firm loses valuable talent as you can see subversive compliance caused by outmoded commandandcontrol leadership approaches can cost organizations unnecessary expense in terms of turnover mistakes loss of customers or clients and reduced productivity the ways in which women have traditionally approached work and leadership provide a fresh new model from which managers of both sexes could learn and profit management versus leadership the demise of commandandcontrol leadership has illuminated the differences between management and leadership of late much has been written on the topic but the difference is best summarized by a simple phrase you manage functions and lead people for example you manage budgets hiring processes quantifiable outcomes or information systems but you can8217t manage people the commandandcontrol style was an attempt to manage people but as i8217ve pointed out it ultimately proved ineffective as workplace attitudes changed people don8217t want to be managed 8212they want to be led and they want to be led by caring humane leaders in this regard management is more closely aligned with masculine leadership traits whereas leadership is more in tune with a woman8217s strengths i believe women are ideally suited to do both8212manage and lead why look at it this way if you8217re able to schedule your hair appointment to coincide with picking up the family8217s dry cleaning but before you have to take the dog to the kennel so that you can leave on a business trip then managing a schedule budget or project is no sweat on the other hand when you8217re responsible for getting the entire family on board with taking a trip to see your inlaws the same weekend that everyone wanted to watch the super bowl then leading a reluctant staff in an organizational change effort becomes a breeze from running households to pta meetings and church fundraisers it8217s likely you8217ve honed the skills needed to lead and manage the importance of differentiating leadership from management was brought home during an association conference presentation that i made several years ago this was a group of people involved in various aspects of the hospitality industry8212conference planners travel agents representatives of hotels and so on after one man disagreed with how i differentiated leadership and management a woman who led the staff of housekeepers at a wellknown hotel chain took issue with him she agreed wholeheartedly that you can8217t manage people and added that if anyone ever doubts it just try to manage people whose sole function is to clean hotel rooms there is nothing more straightforward or easier to measure than how the rooms are cleaned but getting people to do it well is another story success in this field she insisted depends on leadership not management whether it8217s housekeepers zookeepers or barkeepers8212you simply can8217t manage people trying to do so is a bit like teaching a pig to sing you frustrate yourself and annoy the pig the ways in which women without formal control authority or title have gained the support of followers by exhibiting leadership qualities not management skills hold the key to successful leadership in the new millennium a new definition of power and leadership during a presentation i was making to a group of health care providers on the topic of motivating today8217s workforce i commented that the new generation of employees no longer 8220salutes8221 those in authority a ripple of agreement in the form of heads vehemently nodding and polite laughter came from the back of the auditorium where i could see a row of middleaged men and women in uniform i decided to enlist them in underscoring my contention pointing to the back row i said 8220it seems to me as if you would be in a good position to talk to us about employees saluting8221 these participants from the military willingly and poignantly described the shift that has taken place over the past two decades personnel no longer do as they are told simply because someone in a position of power tells them to they also explained that this has caused difficulties with some longerterm senior staff who could not adjust to new and more appropriate styles of leadership in the workplace8212and not only the military workplace8212leaders have traditionally relied on what8217s called position power this is the power and authority that typically accompanied titles such as supervisor manager director and vice president or sergeant lieutenant and general leaders relied on position power because inherent to it was the threat of punishment if their directives were not followed 8220my way or the highway8221 typified reliance on this form of power but newgeneration workers no longer respect position power they have seen political leaders with position power publicly debased because of personal peccadilloes watched as those with position power unceremoniously terminated their companyloyal parents and experienced firsthand a decline in respect for position power in the family position power doesn8217t motivate or faze them since women have not been the primary beneficiaries of position power they have not learned to rely on it in fact women are uncomfortable with even using the word power in relation to themselves my interest in women and power was piqued in the late 1980s when i had a private psychotherapy practice working with career women i would often comment to clients who held seniorlevel corporate positions that it seemed incongruent that one so powerful would allow herself to be treated in this way or that the response was always some form of me powerful i8217m not powerful in my audiotape women and power understanding your fearreleasing your potential i explain the reasons for this 8226nbspnbspsocial messages learned early in childhood imply that power diminishes femininity 8226nbspnbspbecause men have traditionally wielded the power for a woman to think of herself as powerful means that she must take power away from important male figures in her life8212father brother grandfather teachers or the like 8226nbspnbsppowerful women are often singled out and labeled with any number of pejoratives 8226nbspnbspuntil recently there has been a paucity of powerful female role models since noticing the response of the women in my practice i have begun each presentation that i make related to power in the workplace by singling out a woman and saying 8220you look pretty powerful to me8221 with few exceptions the woman shifts uncomfortably in her seat and mumbles something in denial next i turn to a man in the audience and make the same comment with even fewer exceptions the response from the man is a comment or body language that in some way affirms my observation the ensuing discussion of power and what it means clarifies the distinctions between male and female definitions of power whereas men often define being powerful as getting someone else to do what they want or having control over others women tend to define it as getting to do what they want or having control over themselves it certainly isn8217t that women are not powerful because they are it8217s that women wield power differently from men and in a way that better meets the expectations of contemporary followers by necessity they have had to rely on an assortment of techniques to meet their needs and the needs of those who depend on them which is why women possess a wider array of influence skills and exhibit less concern for position power or commandandcontrol leadership women8217s power is often derived from gaining allegiance and loyalty by understanding and addressing the needs of others women not only are socialized to do this better but in fact have had years of practice at it similarly a common theme ran through the interviews i conducted for this book nearly every woman when asked what constitutes her leadership philosophy included some mention of valuesbased leadership values formed the core of how women went about enacting everyday leadership behaviors from developing a vision to creating a highperforming team and taking risks women returned time and again to their values to determine the 8220rightness8221 of their direction this reveals yet one more way in which the uniqueness of a woman8217s perspective forges a leadership model that is so critical for our time what followers really want from leaders there is no shortage of books that describe the necessary qualities of successful leaders from gurus like warren bennis peter drucker john kotter and max de pree we consistently hear that successful leadership includes the ability to 8226nbspnbspcreate a vision align people behind it and develop a plan for executing it 8226nbspnbspcommunicate in a way that inspires trust and confidence 8226nbspnbspmotivate followers to sustain the effort required to meet organizational goals 8226nbspnbspbuild teams that understand and value interdependence and synergy 8226nbspnbspexhibit emotional intelligence 8226nbspnbsptake risks that will benefit the organization 8226nbspnbspdevelop a strong network that will support goal attainment and professional success a close look at the list reveals that these behaviors are identical to the ones women routinely exhibit given their own socialization as nurturers accommodators and caretakers it is precisely these factors that lead me to claim leadership is a woman8217s art women8217s survival has always depended on exhibiting the very behaviors desperately needed in society today at the same time most of the behaviors on the list have also been pejoratively referred to as 8220soft skills8221 having nothing to do with command and control they have traditionally been relegated to lower levels of importance and not perceived by many leaders to be critical success factors whether it8217s bolstering the flagging confidence of a follower teaching groups of people how to become teams or simply building the kinds of relationships that mutually support both leader and follower women eminently fit the bill in tribal villages families ptas hospitals schools8212anyplace where taking care of the most basic but often overlooked needs of people is important8212women are at the center of the activity whether by nature or nurture women8217s focus has always been on ensuring the wellbeing of others while concurrently being required to meet the goals inherent to their roles in the village family or workplace the ability of women to understand the needs of their followers and create a means for moving organizations forward by attending to these needs cannot be underestimated further women are not hampered by old paradigms that merely perpetuate the status quo as relative newcomers to the boardroom we possess precisely what is needed to shift from the tried but no longer true ways of doing things to fresh new approaches toward meeting business objectives one way in which i attempt to make the key concepts of leadership come alive for participants in my leadership workshops is to have them identify leaders from their own lives who brought out the best in them i ask them to name the people who made a significant difference in their lives8212teachers parents coaches clergy spouses bosses and friends8212and then tell the group what made this person so effective regardless of the geographic location the size of the organization or the nature of the work performed by the participants their lists nearly always include these same behaviors 8226nbspnbsptreated me as a human being not just an employee 8226nbspnbspbelieved in me even when i didn8217t believe in myself 8226nbspnbsptrusted me 8226nbspnbspwas interested in my wellbeing8212not just what was best for the company 8226nbspnbspwent to bat for me 8226nbspnbspkept his or her word 8226nbspnbspstretched me by setting high expectations and giving me the tools to achieve them 8226nbspnbspasked for my opinion8212and listened to the answer 8226nbspnbspset a good example 8226nbspnbspwas honest8212would admit when he or she was wrong 8226nbspnbspkept me wellinformed 8226nbspnbspdidn8217t punish me for making mistakes but gave me helpful feedback8212both positive and negative 8226nbspnbspshowed enthusiasm for his or her work 8226nbspnbspwas firm but fair people report that when these characteristics are present they exhibit uncommon commitment to the leader again it8217s not about any particular technique or unusual skill but rather about how people are treated by a leader and the degree to which the leader interacts with them first and foremost as human beings most of the items on the list are behaviors in which women engage naturally openly sharing information encouraging trusting and so forth are all key components of the partnership style of power and interactive leadership style as difficult as it is for many women to acknowledge leadership is not currently and has never been the exclusive domain of men the ways women lead are different but no less valuable8212as women have been led to believe in an effort to maintain control and dominance those who have traditionally held power have minimized our contributions in turn women have minimized their potential as leaders returning to the concept that you must be a leader for your time i reiterate that the time is now for women leaders if ever there was a need to bring out the best in people create interdependent work groups and inspire people to overcome the mediocrity that plagues products and services that time is now8212and women hold the key for doing it successfully compassionately and capably women and leadership selfassessment an essential ingredient of leadership success is the capacity to assess your own strengths and areas that need development8212and make changes to your course when called for doing this allows you to model the way for your followers to do the same women are particularly good at this8212it8217s why they read 8220dear abby8221 listen to dr laura and
