 the two bs my mother loved barbra streisand a lot she had all her records plus she watched her whenever she did a talk show or had a tv special my mother listened to funny girl on the blue victrola cabinet she got at the flea market a cabinet she stripped and stained herself somehow alone in the garage my mom had five kids and her own mother living with her how did she have time to do anything i have four kids a wife and two nannies and i am often overwhelmed my mother took the time out to fill up on yellow yellow is my shorthand for real for true for beauty yellow means what is good with our world my mother knew yellow we watched billie jean king together as she beat bobby riggs my mother took us to radio city to see the christmas show my mother pointed out the women who had risen above what it meant to be a woman back then in the 1960s and even now too 8220streisand8221 my mother would say 8220look at her from brooklyn look at her now8221 8220anything is possible little girl8221 my mother told me this in her own way usually without words irish people are sometimes not so good with words they are sometimes not so good with feelings that8217s why inside i8217m a jew i want to feel it talk it live it scream it i want it all out there at some point in my childhood my mother told me about barbara walters probably she pointed her out to me on the tv this woman was a weather girl who worked her way up to being coanchor with harry reasoner who interviewed every world leader and she did all this at a time when women were told it was impossible she paved the way for oprah and katie couric and diane sawyer and every tv newswoman every female tv personality for that matter my mother recognized barbara walters8217s meaning from the getgo we used to watch barbara walters my mother recognized that walters was always imparting two levels of information the spoken and the implicit the spoken was the this and that of the day8217s news the implicit was that it was now possible for a woman to deliver that news we watched barbara walters8217s phenomenal rise to the top we watched more closely still the wide wake she left a path i think my mother wanted me to see barbra streisand she was about the ultimate she was genius incarnate she was a goddess to us while walters was of this world what barbara walters proved to us was that women could rise in this world what barbra streisand proved to us was that art was beyond gender and through it one could rise right beyond this world and get to someplace better several years ago i left my show i8217d lost the ability to get to the place streisand had shown me was possible six years of celebrityhood had left me depleted and i had to find myself find my art and find my family again i went off the air so i could touch down on the ground and i did and the ground felt good i had my kids back8212chelsea parker blake and vivi i had my wife kel and i had started up a gay cruise ship business and twice a year we went sailing with other gay families we filmed it all and made a documentary of what it means to be a gay family we screened the documentary one night at the new york arts center this was in april 2006 one month prior to this march 17 had been the thirtythird anniversary of my mother8217s death there were rumors sometime around then that streisand was thinking at age sixtyfour of going back on tour it was april in new york city the trees were putting on green sleeves boats were back on the hudson and my movie was finally done and so barbara walters came to this first screening she wasn8217t a stranger to me not only had i spent much of my childhood watching her on tv and more significant still watching my mother watch her on tv i8217d also known her as an adult in my own right i8217d had dinner with barbara walters and she8217d even been to our home to interview kelli once we were friends in the celebrity kind of way8212you know and respect each other8212you have dinner every few months you don8217t chat on the phone but there is an undeniable association a shared intimacy that paradoxically lacks all intimacy you are members of an exclusive club where everyone speaks a language very few others have been able to attain fame a few weeks before the premiere of my documentary i8217d been to a party at barbara8217s house this was a party for mike bloomberg and kel got all dressed up to go kel looked beautiful she always does i was wearing my standard black pants from target and my j jill clogs and we went uptown and we were curious we8217d never seen barbara walters8217s house before going there was a fairly big deal we rode the elevator up and walked into a stunning red room and there was barbara in the center wearing a beautiful gold lameacute evening gown the same one she probably wore to interview some heads of state maybe idi amin dada or prince charles or even the dalai lama she looked flawless and stunning in her bright red room a julian schnabel painting on the wall a double piano the keys as white as teeth a man in a tux playing i was well i was enchanted almost flabbergasted8212the color the beauty the women with their silk sheaths and the hors d8217oeuvres served on trays with scalloped rims a lot of people might assume that8217s what celebrities do go to fancy parties with double baby grands in merlotcolored rooms but the fact is i don8217t mostly especially since leaving my show i8217m home with kel and the kids eating stringbean casseroles with fried onions on top blake8217s favorite i remember a waiter whisked by offering me some flaky layered thing at dinner i sat next to liz smith i think it was during the serving of the second course that in walked this woman gorgeous i mean she looked like annmargret meets jessica rabbit she had a clintonlike charisma when i asked 8220who the hell is that8221 liz smith said 8220that8217s georgette mosbacher8221 georgette looked at me from across the room she seemed dreamlike i said to barbara walters 8220i have to know her8221 barbara may not have taken me seriously at first 8220look barbara8221 i kept saying 8220i8217m enchanted8221 i don8217t know if barbara arranged it or not but not long after georgette came over to me she leaned in real close and said 8220i8217m a republican don8217t tell anyone i8217m in the closet8221 people have questioned me about the way i8217m drawn to certain people men and women both my attractions to other people are not sexual in any sense that seems hard for people to really believe there was for instance a weekend when jane fonda came to visit me we were in my craft room i was showing her some art i had made in one of my collages was a photograph of madonna 8220you two were lovers8221 jane fonda said more of a statement than a question i said 8220no we were never ever lovers we were sisters from the moment we met8221 there was never anything sexual about it this surprised jane her surprise surprised me after dinner the night of barbara8217s party i remember singing 8220liza with a 8216z82178221 as a beautiful oldschool pianist played on the baby grand i could feel barbara walters watching me sometimes that happens a stare seems to have weight or touch someone8217s eyes land on you that night it was barbara8217s eyes mixed up with my voice as i sang 8220liza with a 8216z82178221 i was in barbara8217s world and the song was a string pulling her back i think to the days when she was younger when her father lou walters who owned the famous latin quarter nightclub was alive i believe that song brought her back to something in her past and i could see her seeing me barbara walters the woman my mother admired for the wide wake she made the woman who in delivering news became news herself i am drawn to many people in many different ways8212sister friend buddy colleague8212but to barbara i was drawn differently perhaps because my mother died when i was still a child i will forever in certain instances see women who are much older than i am as a child might barbara was the age my mother would have been had she survived her cancer and i also knew barbara had a daughter and was therefore a mother when i saw barbara i saw my mother seeing her i saw the television in our house on rhonda lane and the gray telephone poles supporting miles and miles of wires stretching high up a hill toward a place we could never get to maybe the song was bringing barbara back to her past all i knew was at that moment we shared something real i wondered what it was and then the song ended it was time to go home we left the red room and during the many many months i worked on the view i was not invited back but the room left an impression on me so much so that even now if i close my eyes i can see still its hue a red that resists words but that pulses on nevertheless a color too rich too much like the woman herself she is striking and beautiful but also blinding barbara walters her beautiful red giving off a glare that makes one want to wince in both pleasure and pain and then to turn toward something softer two weeks after the red room the party i invited barbara walters to the premiere of my documentary and i8217m glad i did it i8217m proud of that film it shows gay families as they really are struggling with all the same things every other family struggles with sunscreen diapers sippy cups and stubbornness what makes the film so moving is how grateful the families are to finally have a place some place to go together i8217m also proud to have made it at a time when my career was down in the dumps because here i was doing something creating a whole other thing there was beauty and truth in that movie a film about children and parents about love and human equality and vulnerability the women who directed it get all the credit i8217m not sure i could have put it together and said so succinctly what it is that gay families are about without their help the movie ends with a view of the huge ship on the caribbean blue waters and then the lights went back on and people rustled up out of their seats i was in the lobby and i saw barbara walters come out of the theater crying 8220rosie8221 she said 8220would you ever consider being the permanent cohost of the view 8221 i looked her in the eyes that she was moved moved me that she had shown workingclass women like my mother that a wider wake was possible8212that moved me too i8217d been out of show business for four years a sacred silence this had been but maybe i was ready to go back what happened next i didn8217t plan i certainly could never have anticipated it and still today i can8217t explain it all i know is this 8220barbara walters8221 i said 8220i8217ll do whatever you ask8221 as it turns out i did not do whatever she asked i came on the view and this is the story of how it all happened offstage onstage how we struggled to make the show and then so much more than that this is an account of what it means to make a show and a friend and an enemy or two this is about where we went wrong and right it8217s a story about stars and celebrities and one woman8212me8212going off air four years ago and then trying to reenter orbit not knowing if she can it8217s the story of wondering whether i could give up the addictive elixir of fame and then go back wondering if it8217s possible to sip instead of slug it8217s a revision of a book i did four years ago just as i left my show but trashed because it was too soon i could go on and on it8217s a story about so much but the only thing that matters here now is her question 8220will you come8221 and my response 8220i8217ll do whatever you ask8221 and how over the year that turned out not to be true at all how i did not do whatever barbara walters asked how in fact i did very little of what she asked how she started as a sort of mother and me a child willing to obey and where we finally ended up months later two very different women with very different values living in very different rooms battered by betrayal but nevertheless doing what women all over the world do best barbara walters and i after all that happened over those hard months after all the trump dump and divisive ways of the world we are in we have still and nevertheless at the very end we have found a way to talk we have found dare i say a way to love we found i have to hope a friendship that like any other friendship is both compromised and connected
