 chapter one oh my god oh my god where were those shoes oh god not the manolos it was fashion week in paris and if it was tuesday it was chanel and if it was chanel it was my new black manolo slingbacks with the twoandahalfinch kitten heels to go with the charcoalgray tweed aline skirt i got at the chanel sample sale last season and the perfectly cocoesque black boiledwool jacket with the delicate grosgrain trim that i had slipped out of my mother8217s closet years ago it said so right there on the daily wardrobe schedule i had meticulously entered into an excel spreadsheet last week chanel skirt trusty black jacket black la perla bra the one with the light padding matching thong tahitian pearl choker mabe ring the black balenciaga bag the brown version was slated for thursday manolo slingbacks only on this tuesday morning the shoes were nowhere to be seen among the contents of the three suitcases scattered around me what a disaster this would throw off my week8217s schedule completely i mean i suppose i could switch over to the wednesday outfit but then i8217d be wearing vintage yves saint laurent8212and we8217re talking monsieur saint laurent himself not the tom ford era8212to a chanel show and that just wouldn8217t do not given the history between saint laurent and karl lagerfeld i8217m not stupid i know better than to do that and forget about the thursday outfit god and anna wintour know better than to wear stella mccartney to kaiser karl8217s show nope it was chanel or bust and without those manolos i was utterly absolutely fabulously screwed never mind missing an appointment at john galliano8217s showroom or getting lost in the stampede of fashion editors in black town cars herded from celine to louis vuitton or even accidentally leaving my goodie bag under the seat like i did that one time at fendi in milan or heaven forbid being seated in the third row at prada that8212that i could just almost deal with forgetting my slingbacks or my thoughts darkened having them filched by some shoeconnoisseur bag handler on the eurostar and messing up my entire week8217s wardrobe this was unacceptable the chanel show was scheduled for eleven o8217clock but with all the airkissing and gossiping followed closely by backbiting the very same people you8217d just been kissing it wouldn8217t start until noon at least and you wonder why you almost never see watches featured in runway shows if i found it in myself to be decisive in the next oh fifteen minutes or so i could probably run over to the bon marcheacute a few blocks away pick out a new pair of pointytoed black slingbacks without too much of an ordeal and then make it on time to the show at the chanel boutique next door to coco chanel8217s original maison on the rue cambon after a minute and fortytwo seconds of indecision8212a record low for me i could be well almost sure8212i gingerly tiptoed my way through the minefield that was my hotel room floor trying not to step on the thousands of dollars8217 worth of prada marni dior and mcqueen strewn here there everywhere now where did i put the wednesday shoes i slipped them on and8212mortified as i was that the threeinch heels were way too high for the outfit8212took one last glance at myself in the fulllength mirror in the absurdly large bathroom from the ankles up anyway that was one fullfledged fashionista looking back at me not bad for a texas girl with big hair and blue eyeshadow in her notsodistant past i grabbed my scheduled tuesday handbag and was off i checked myself out again in the ornate mirrors in the lobby of the oldworldposh hocirctel steclaire ever since my first visit to paris just out of college when my editorial assistant8217s salary made a slightly shabby bohemian i thought at the time little hotel in the latin quarter my only option i had loved staying on the left bank it wasn8217t always convenient for the shows8212but then again the avantgarde designers made a point of putting on shows at locations that weren8217t particularly convenient to anywhere leave the grand hotels on the right bank to the tourists i8217d take the narrow cobblestoned streets alleys really that revealed hidden gems of boutiques to the determined shopper of course it didn8217t hurt that a prada boutique was also right around the corner once through the doors of the bon marcheacute i could finally let out a sigh of relief the sight of the pretty little trinkets ripe for the buying8212the sparkly lipsticksize judith leiber handbags side by side with some delicate jetbeaded earrings i could most definitely fit into my thursday ensemble8212reminded me that i was in my element indeed my natural habitat surely marieclaude my favorite saleslady largely because she deigned to understand my timid french could find something just right to replace my misplaced shoes and surely i reassured myself my editor would forgive me for expensing them i expertly maneuvered past the busload of japanese tourists manhandling the vuitton bags on the ground floor circumvented the perfume spritzers and makeover artists and sprinted upstairs to my most favorite section of the store8212of any store anywhere literally anywhere a few years back i managed to wangle a trip to vietnam to do a story on the textiles made by a northern hill tribe that had inspired donna karan8217s resort collection and i scored some intricately embroidered slippers from some cobblers five villages away daniel day lewis eat your heart out my seldomtested journalistic ingenuity kicked in when in pursuit of one thing and one thing only it wasn8217t my fault i inherited my weakness for shoes from my mother who bought me my first pair of girly mary janes when i was two and went back to the store to buy herself a matching pair that same afternoon and from my father who has been known to order three pairs of the same shoe at once i was doomed from the start oh the many incarnations and variations of that most miraculous of inventions bunions and fallen arches be damned dainty mules and sturdysoled boots sexy stilettos and practical brogues manolo makes 8217em and i buy 8217em how perfectly the world turns or so i thought until i scanned the third floor and there was nary a sign of the saleswoman8217s severe black bob and perfect posture marieclaude was missing just like my poor slingbacks disconsolate i imagined the shoeconnoisseur bag handler stuffing his big smelly feet into my beautiful shoes and prancing around waterloo station in them i shuddered in marieclaude8217s usual corner i spotted from behind a darkhaired man in a savile row pinstripe suit and what i could tell were handtooled italian loafers i perked up a salesman wearing handtooled italian loafers couldn8217t be half bad 8220excusezmoi monsieur8221 i said with a nervous smile when he turned around i noted how his brown hair faded to gray at his temples and how the tiny wrinkles around his cornflowerblue eyes crinkled when he smiled back at me there was something very familiar there 8220oui mademoiselle8221 he said our eyes locked for a split second and he paused as he registered my baffled stare 8220mr billings monsieur jacques eastview high school sixthperiod french class 1990 what on earth are you doing here8221 he stared back did that thing he did with the crinkling eyes and then burst into a hearty laugh 8220saints alive8221 mr billings8212monsieur jacques to his pupils8212said in his texas drawl 8220well if it isn8217t my star student alexandra simons8221 i cringed prize pupil i might have been but i8217d figured out pretty quickly my first time in paris that all those french pop songs we sang in class didn8217t help much when it came to asking a parisian for directions to the hermegraves store but i would let monsieur jacques believe what he wanted to 8220oh you8217re such a kidder8221 i said pretending to be modest 8220well just look at you8221 he said sizing me up and smiling appreciatively 8220what a gorgeous skirt chanel8221 8220as a matter of fact yes8221 i said certain i was blushing from head to toe that was part of his charm he always did notice one student8217s new haircut or another8217s favorite pair of shoes i added hurriedly 8220i haven8217t exactly kept in touch with anyone from back home i didn8217t know y8217all finally upped and moved to paris8221 i did a mental double take at myself did i just say y8217all 8220oh well you know my wife and i split up last year8221 he said 8220i was ready to start fresh and i always did dream of livin8217 here so i decided by gum i8217d do it8221 monsieur jacques was the most popular teacher at eastview his class was always overbooked with besotted girls8212it reminded me of that scene in raiders of the lost ark when the student in harrison ford8217s class had i love you written on her eyelids only instead of being roughandtumble like indiana jones monsieur jacques was as suave as you could ever imagine in suburban dallas texas he didn8217t reek of old spice like the other teachers and he most certainly would never have been caught dead in the polyester pants and pocket protectors favored by our physics teacher no monsieur jacques was cosmopolitan he wore these expensive custommade shoes that glided down the hallways without so much as a squeak his suits were bespoke before i knew what bespoke was he smoked gauloises out back behind the gym between classes he spoke french for god8217s sake how he could have emerged from the primordial ooze of houston i could never figure out his only fault in our adolescent eyes was his beautiful sloeeyed painter wife who would pick him up after school in her vintage red mustang convertible his tie finally undone and his hair flopping in the wind they8217d speed off into the sunset or at least to some smoky salon gathering of artists and philosophers that we had only read about in french novels in translation of course he couldn8217t have been older than twentyeight or twentynine then i guessed which put him in his early forties now and i supposed my demographicgroup peer i had reached that awkward age when it was technically proper to call my parents8217 friends by their first names and maybe even socialize with them but i would certainly never dream of it same situation with monsieur jacques here we were both grownups both single so i had a mad crush on him back then and the thought of his touching my feet i will confess might have once been the subject of a daydream that spanned sixthperiod french class all the way through seventhperiod chemistry but put that in the context of his helping me buy some shoes8212well it kind of broke the spell didn8217t it and now and now all i could really think about was whether it would be okay to tutoyer him it was just one of the many existential issues plaguing me in my beginningadulthood crisis and let8217s not even mention the fact that my parents already had two kids by the time they were my age of course had i never left texas after high school that would8217ve been all taken care of by now i could8217ve probably thrown in a divorce or two to boot 8220i8217m sorry to hear about the split monsieur j82128221 i stopped myself midjacques and laughed 8220you can call me jack or jacques conveniently interchangeable8221 he said 8220well jacques8221 i said 8220it is so good to see you here i really do want to catch up really 8221 i looked down at my shoddily shod feet 8220but i really really need a new pair of shoes i8217m fixin8217 to go to this fashion show82218212a quick glance at my watch might have left me panicked had i not been distracted by my use of the word fixin8217 82128220oh my god in like twenty minutes could you help me please8221 8220well aren8217t you livin8217 the glamorous life8221 he said his eyes filled with laughter and what i momentarily regressing to my girlish crush giddily registered as impressed approval 8220oh you know8221 i said grinning stupidly 8220it8217s just a job i8217ve been covering fashion for the weekly magazine for the past couple of years i8217m based in london8221 and for the benefit of my parents who paid for my 120000 college education i added dutifully as was my wont 8220i did hard news before you know earthquakes transit strikes the winona ryder trial8221 i glanced at the dozen and a half marginally different variations of pointytoed black slingbacks daintily displayed on the white formica tables around me and nodded at the one closest to me 8220now do you think that louboutin heel is too spiky for this skirt length8221 fifteen minutes later i left the bon marcheacute with my wednesday shoes in a shopping bag some utterly demure black louboutin slingbacks on my feet i would have gone for something a little sexier but somehow i thought that would embarrass monsieur jacques or maybe just me and oh yes jacques8217s cell phone number in my palm if the girls from eastview high could see me now fighting for a taxi with a little old parisian lady armed with a baguette fresh from the boulangerie she was clad in beige chanel tweed and d8217orsay pumps a cigarette dangling from her scarletpainted lips i8217d spotted her from all the way down the block and between us was a man stepping out of what seemed to be the only available taxi in the arrondissement as he paid the driver i made my way as quickly as i could while still taking care not to get my new heels caught in any grates8212or more likely dog poop8212that might have been in my path i never let chanel lady out of my sight oh i could tell that she saw me too our eyes locked at twenty paces i sped up she sped up i flashed her my best intimidating american look she shot back a haughty parisian if coco chanel had been looking down from heaven she would surely have been tickled to see that two women wearing clothes bearing her name were playing chicken over a taxi in the blink of an eye8212that is had either of us wimped out and blinked8212we both lunged at the door handle as if it were the one and only birkin bag left at the editors8217 preview night of the hermegraves sample sale luckily i was younger8212and more desperate i felt the weight of the bread beating against my back as i slipped into the cab and locked the door behind me chanel lady8212and as it turned out i had used that word loosely8212was spitting venom at me i tried to read her lips did she really just call me a putain i have always been convinced that the ability to curse at someone in another language was the best measure of fluency and now i was wishing more than ever that monsieur jacques had taught us something really useful instead i did something almost universally understood i stuck my tongue out at her and waved what a harridan i thought to myself as i brushed the baguette8217s flour off my jacket catching my breath in my cab i took a moment to contemplate how in paris there really was no going gently into mumsy housedresses and earlybird specials women there would give up their cigarettes and red wine before they relinquished short skirts lipstick and heels but no pantyhose perish the thought chanel lady at least had impeccable taste 8220numeacutero vingtneuf rue cambon s8217il vous plaicirct8221 i told the driver i could have sworn that was a lascivious look he gave me no matter i had become accustomed to being chatted up by taxi drivers during fashion weeks in paris and milan more than one had asked me8212all 58217582178217 of me in threeinch heels8212if i was a model they must figure that one day they8217ll hit the jackpot usually i just played along to practice my french or italian but there was no time for pleasantries today not when the show was about to start and i was still across the seine 8220je suis en retard8221 i told him trying my most flirtatiously pleading face he stepped on the gas i could see his smirk in the rearview mirror 8220et vous ecirctes mannequin n8217estce pas8221 i tried i really tried not to roll my eyes and instead just gave him a tight smile i guess my smackdown of chanel lady had only increased my standing in his eyes i avoided his gaze and just looked out the window as we weaved through the paris streets past the students loaded down with backpacks the couples strolling hand in hand and the tourists with their noses in time out paris guides past the pensioners braving the march chill to while away their morning over a cafeacute au lait and a brioche at a sidewalk cafeacute they were all the sights that once filled me with breathless fueled thoughts of romance and that i now rarely had time to notice when there were catwalks and catfights to write about we inched our way across the river and past the obelisk in the place de la concorde down the faubourg sthonoreacute to the corner of rue cambon i hadn8217t noticed in a long time just how pretty paris was i stepped out of the cab a few minutes past noon outside the entrance was the dramatic tableau that had become so familiar to me a scrum of fashion students paparazzi wannabe modelizers and assorted other hangerson were all pushing and grabbing at something nothing everything falsealarm star sightings were met with a flurry of camera flashes until word spread that it was someone who simply looked like a clist celebrity while several beefy men clad entirely in black and wired with those secret service earphones handled crowd control the far more imposinglooking pr girls did the real dirty work checking tickets and crossreferencing the guest list i waved my invitation at them and they let me pass handing me a goodie bag no 5 eau de toilette i guessed on my way in the music8212unrecognizable bubblegum pop8212was thumping too loud for me to ask for help from the ushers who were in any case too busy ogling the sprinkling of french film starlets in technicolor dresses cut down to there and up to here who were at the show in search of a touch of class i had no idea where to find my seat in the maze of rooms and doorways one room led into another and on and on on either side of each room three rows of whitesatincushioned chairs had been tightly plotted like a zerolot suburban subdevelopment a narrow corridor in between the two banks of seats served as the runway winding through a doorway and into the next room the lack of a real catwalk8212the models just strolled casually through the boutique8212gave the show an impression of intimacy a false impression of course considering there were probably four hundred people gathered there to see the glamazons in various stages of undress but the setup did make for a wise seating plan more frontrow seats meant fewer miffed editors dressed to kill in this season8217s chanel the usual suspects formed a murderers8217 row front and center wait a minute what was moda 8217s editorinchief doing still wrapped up in her fulllength fox fur slumped in her seat could it be that not only was she wearing the identical bloodorange tweed minidress fringed jacket and logo boots as someone else in the room8212but her twin was the mere fashion editor of max mode i would just about die if that ever happened to me i thought as i joined the chorus of titters in the room apparently the paparazzi had already had their field day when the doppelgangers8212who was whose double would surely be the subject of some debate at the valentino dinner tonight8212crossed paths on their way to their seats i could just make out the details from some stylists who were whispering nearby damn my replacement shoes i couldn8217t believe i had missed the action in their place of dishonor in a cordonedoff corner of the first room two dozen photographers were busy elbowing each other to stake their claim to the best vantage point8212the one where they might if they were lucky capture on film some naive new model adjusting her gstring they8217d obviously been forced to wait too long they were starting into some world cup soccer chants in the back rows the newbies were poised on the very edge of their seats soaking in every detail of the room their neighbors the lights the music this place was about to burst i made my way through the room pausing here and there for an air kiss8212a longdistance air kiss in some cases way in the back of the maison i saw some camera flashes go off and then a blur of long legs and the snap of some hundred editors8217 notebooks opening pens at the ready the show must have just started great i had to hurry i wandered through the room and paused in the doorway into the next i checked the seating assignment written on my invitation again what on earth did dc2vii mean 8220excusezmoi8221 8220excusezmoi8221 8220excusezmoi8221 crossing the threshold into the third room i spotted my seat second row right in the middle bloody hell i muttered second row even worse from either side i would have to climb over at least five people i could start from the far side of the row and get dirty looks from the fashion editor features and shopping of harper8217s bazaar and the associate market editor of italian vogue at least they didn8217t have any baguettes on them i thought with great relief or i could go to the near side and earn the ire of the buyer ladies8217 designer sportswear of neiman marcus and a couple of stylists i didn8217t really know i weighed my options for all of twelve seconds far better to alienate another editor i figured than anyone from neiman8217s the fashion mecca of my childhood i combed my fingers through my hair and smoothed down my jacket straightened my back took a step onto the makeshift runway and just as i was about to attempt my most dignified shuffle down to the other side of the row i heard the wave of gasps spread across the room counterclockwise and circle back to me and then i heard myself gasp talk about making an entrance before i knew it8212and certainly before i could do anything about it8212i found myself suddenly face to left breast with a certain sixfoot blonde from latvia pleased to meet you katyarina the season8217s hot new model was midstep in her peculiarly mesmerizing monty python gait which her fans and sycophants described as gazellelike the more reasonable might have compared her to a giraffe on acid and i like a deer caught in the headlights certainly not even a gazelle on a good day whatever i wasn8217t moving fast enough to get out of the way the gasps turned into snickers we veered right in unison and then left still perfectly aligned as if we were doing some 1980s mirrorimage dance on the fourth parry we collided again her boot8217s sharp stiletto heel cutting into my brandnew beautiful slingback we stumbled to the floor together a tangle of splayed legs8212mostly katyarina8217s the photographers couldn8217t believe their luck the excited mob of arms and legs and lenses moved as one as they pounced on us in the shock and horror of the moment my mind wandered aimlessly where on earth could my left shoe be i sure hope that8217s my own knee i8217m grabbing i think i did this move in yoga once the sounds of the shutters clicking and the laughter echoing through the room deafened me and i felt the intense heat of their flashbulbs on my face i closed my eyes to the white lights8212god i only wished they were the ones they say you see when you8217re dying i slowly opened my eyes to a squint just in time to catch a glimpse of katyarina8217s tearstained face the glittery fashionshow makeup puddling in muddy gobs around her eyes and then sliding down the rivulets of tears on her cheeks she was sixteen seventeen tops and yet behind the tears she looked at me not angrily just questioningly call me crazy but i could have sworn she was thinking 8220i know this publicity is only going to help my career but what8217s in it for you8221 at least ten publicists had rushed over to pull her up off the runway the crowd parted and i was left alone for a split second totally paralyzed the embarrassment must have been written all over my face8212oh i8217ll know for sure when i see it in the papers tomorrow i realized lordy lordy lordy this was not good not good at all i feigned pride got myself on my feet clumsily gathered my shoes and bags and booked somelikeithaut_ornamentjpg back in journalism school8212the one concession to academia that i made for my father the professor after i finished college and took a job as a 24000ayear editorial assistantslashindentured servant at the weekly 8212we were taught never to become part of a story like i said we were taught that when i8217d eventually have to write up this twisted story that i had practically wedded at center stage at least i would be able to describe katyarina8217s outfit in great detail black boiledwool cropped jacket and matching aline skirt with an anklet composed of one humiliated fashion journalist consider it personally factchecked holed up an hour later at my room at the steclaire which was now filled with white lilies and other flowers of condolence thoughtfully sent by my doubtlessly gloating peers i wondered if i could ever overcome this public selfimmolation or for that matter if i could ever leave this hotel room and face anyone again by the time i had escaped the lights and cameras at chanel and scurried back to the hotel my newly handy balenciaga raised to shield my eyes as if it were the sunniest day in the caribbean there were already five phone messages and six emails from my editor roddy james as annoyed as i was i had to give him this he had good sources he started out trying to be funny 8220hey alex it8217s roddy you aren8217t leaving the magazine for tv are you because you seemed rather telegenic on sky news your face8212well it8217s more like the back of your head and your left arm somehow underneath that model8217s right leg and her left foot my god it was like twister the couture edition8221 he laughed altogether too heartily almost as an afterthought he signed off with a chipper 8220call me8221 by the fourth message he sounded plaintive 8220hey it8217s roddy again where are you and why is your cell phone off now i know there8217s no witness protection plan for fashionistas don8217t do anything drastic without calling me first won8217t you please8221 i didn8217t bother listening to the fifth one i just erased them all and crawled into the kingsize bed still decked out in my tuesday outfit pulled the covers over my head and for the first time in my thirtyone years seriously considered plastic surgery if i could find michael jackson8217s surgeon8212and if he hadn8217t already lost his license8212i8217d be positively unrecognizable i could change my name i could move to some place where sky news didn8217t exist where they didn8217t know anything about fashion hey maybe my parents would let me move back home to texas i couldn8217t think of anything more depressing except maybe what my life was like at this moment fashion week had barely started and there was simply no way i could withstand the stares the whispers the smirks i just wasn8217t that brave8212or stupid roddy would have to understand maybe he could get a freelancer here to finish the week and i could quietly disappear for a while but then what would i ever be able to come back as much as i joked about having the fluffiest job at the magazine jetting around europe covering the fashion industry was a plum assignment calling it an industry somehow gave it more weight in my mind i had dined with donatella and gabbed with gabbana and8212much to my mother8217s awe and pride8212i had met the master himself monsieur saint laurent my friends envied me despite how often i told them that things just weren8217t as glamorous as they seemed a sane person can take only so many hourlong waits in farflung locales for seventeenminute splashes of bright lights loud music and the occasional divinely cut suit squeeze thirty of those into one week multiply by four cities twice a year and you8217ve got one spent fashionista on the other hand i got invited to sample sales that weren8217t listed in the daily candy i was this close to getting a clothing allowance for heaven8217s sake now that wasn8217t something that was discussed in j school the only free outfits my j school classmates could aspire to get on assignment were fatigues and gas masks of the ones who weren8217t stuck in podunk on the overnight police beat tara wright had written an awardwinning exposeacute on salad bars in new york city delis and mark mcintyre had covered two civil wars in countries even nonamericans couldn8217t pick out on a map i covered a different sort of hotspot places like the bar at the hocirctel costes the closest i had gotten to a skirmish was a year ago when the french police shut down the big armani gala at stsulpice and forcefully evacuated the whole fashion pack in all our finery from the tents my one war wound a pair of jimmy choo snakeskin mules destroyed in the mud and confusion but mostly i had written a heck of a lot about kimono sleeves and deconstructed seams pulitzer glory or fashion freebies what8217s a girl to choose for a while i convinced myself that i didn8217t really have to choose i injected humor and intelligence into my stories sometimes surprising even myself with what i remembered from my liberalarts education so what if i had gotten letters from readers wondering what the russian revolution had to do with the latest colors in lipstick good thing roddy edited out my references to trotsky and so what if the nietzsche reference in the feature i did last month on stilettos might have been lost on most of the readers who were just looking for a new pair of shoes but8212hah8212did i not do them a service in the end i was good at this rationalizing thing but i needed to think only of one thing to snap me back to my senses there were plenty of people out there who would kill for my position8212including that frighteningly ambitious new reporter roddy had just hired straight out of oxford8212and since i had helped them out with a little career suicide they would be clamoring at the gates and i just couldn8217t let that happen i poked my head out from the covers and reached for the phone he let it ring four times before he answered 8220roddy james speaking8221 8220hello roddy it8217s me alex8221 8220oh right alex so what8217s new8221 8220like you have to ask8221 8220now is that any way to talk to the magnanimous editor who is going to let you keep your job8221 8220roddy you have no idea how horrible it was8221 i could no longer hold back the tears that had built up from the wretchedness of the day8212losing my shoes getting clobbered by a baguette literally crashing a show and now i couldn8217t decide which was worse blubbering in front of my editor or blubbering to my editor 8220it all happened so quickly i was just walking in and i couldn8217t find my seat so i was just wandering around and then i saw my seat and it was right in the middle and i couldn8217t quite decide how to get into that row without pissing off a bunch82128220 he cut me off 8220be quiet for a minute and listen to me people will forget you know how fickle fashionistas are they8217ll forget you in a split second remember when that model what8217s her name oona tripped on her platform shoes and took a tumble on the runway how long did they talk about that a minute8221 i remembered it well actually i was emailing my friends pictures of oona8217s spill for weeks updating them with every new unflattering angle i found damn my bad karma roddy was barreling along on his lame attempt at a pep talk it really wasn8217t working i knew he didn8217t believe a single word he was saying and deep down he probably realized that i didn8217t either 8220sure there are some who thrive on schadenfreude but who needs them8221 he said optimistically 8220it will be a blip you8217ll be able to laugh it off in no time and knowing you you8217ll be joining in when there8217s someone else to make fun of8221 8220roddy8221 i gasped 8220do you really think that of me8221 his laugh started out as a snicker and quickly crescendoed into a fullon eyeswatering abscrunching guffaw sixty seconds later when he finally was able to draw breath he broke my stewing silence 8220alex bottom line is that we need the story we8217ve got four pages in the next issue slated for your fashion week coverage you8217ve got to stick it out8221 8220but82128220 8220and no we8217re not hiring a freelancer we want you to do it we need you8221 damn that roddy james i could never argue when i heard those three little words come out of his mouth in that confoundedly sexy british accent of his before hanging up he got me to promise that i would find something to write about8212and in exchange he would sign my expense report however bloated it might become this time around oh he knew where my weaknesses were and i hadn8217t even mentioned the part my missing shoes had played in the whole ordeal
