 chapter one the end t his is a story about a man named eddie and it begins at the end with eddie dying in the sun it might seem strange to start a story with an ending but all endings are also beginnings we just dont know it at the time the last hour of eddies life was spent like most of the others at ruby pier an amusement park by a great gray ocean the park had the usual attractions a boardwalk a ferris wheel roller coasters bumper cars a taffy stand and an arcade where you could shoot streams of water into a clowns mouth it also had a big new ride called freddys free fall and this would be where eddie would be killed in an accident that would make newspapers around the state at the time of his death eddie was a squat whitehaired old man with a short neck a barrel chest thick forearms and a faded army tattoo on his right shoulder his legs were thin and veined now and his left knee wounded in the war was ruined by arthritis he used a cane to get around his face was broad and craggy from the sun with salty whiskers and a lower jaw that protruded slightly making him look prouder than he felt he kept a cigarette behind his left ear and a ring of keys hooked to his belt he wore rubbersoled shoes he wore an old linen cap his pale brown uniform suggested a workingman and a workingman he was eddies job was quotmaintainingquot the rides which really meant keeping them safe every afternoon he walked the park checking on each attraction from the tiltawhirl to the pipeline plunge he looked for broken boards loose bolts wornout steel sometimes he would stop his eyes glazing over and people walking past thought something was wrong but he was listening thats all after all these years he could hear trouble he said in the spits and stutters and thrumming of the equipment w ith 50 minutes left on earth eddie took his last walk along ruby pier he passed an elderly couple quotfolksquot he mumbled touching his cap they nodded politely customers knew eddie at least the regular ones did they saw him summer after summer one of those faces you associate with a place his work shirt had a patch on the chest that read eddie above the word maintenance and sometimes they would say quothiya eddie maintenancequot although he never thought that was funny today it so happened was eddies birthday his 83rd a doctor last week had told him he had shingles shingles eddie didnt even know what they were once he had been strong enough to lift a carousel horse in each arm that was a long time ago quot eddie quot quot take me eddiequot quottake mequot forty minutes until his death eddie made his way to the front of the roller coaster line he rode every attraction at least once a week to be certain the brakes and steering were solid today was coaster day the quotghoster coasterquot they called this one and the kids who knew eddie yelled to get in the cart with him children liked eddie not teenagers teenagers gave him headaches over the years eddie figured hed seen every sort of donothing snarlatyou teenager there was but children were different children looked at eddie who with his protruding lower jaw always seemed to be grinning like a dolphin and they trusted him they drew in like cold hands to a fire they hugged his leg they played with his keys eddie mostly grunted never saying much he figured it was because he didnt say much that they liked him now eddie tapped two little boys with backward baseball caps they raced to the cart and tumbled in eddie handed his cane to the ride attendant and slowly lowered himself between the two quothere we go here we go quot one boy squealed as the other pulled eddies arm around his shoulder eddie lowered the lap bar and clackclackclack up they went a story went around about eddie when he was a boy growing up by this very same pier he got in an alley fight five kids from pitkin avenue had cornered his brother joe and were about to give him a beating eddie was a block away on a stoop eating a sandwich he heard his brother scream he ran to the alley grabbed a garbage can lid and sent two boys to the hospital after that joe didnt talk to him for months he was ashamed joe was the oldest the firstborn but it was eddie who did the fighting quot can we go again eddie please quot thirtyfour minutes to live eddie lifted the lap bar gave each boy a sucking candy retrieved his cane then limped to the maintenance shop to cool down from the summer heat had he known his death was imminent he might have gone somewhere else instead he did what we all do he went about his dull routine as if all the days in the world were still to come one of the shop workers a lanky bonycheeked young man named dominguez was by the solvent sink wiping grease off a wheel quotyo eddiequot he said quotdomquot eddie said the shop smelled like sawdust it was dark and cramped with a low ceiling and pegboard walls that held drills and saws and hammers skeleton parts of fun park rides were everywhere compressors engines belts lightbulbs the top of a pirates head stacked against one wall were coffee cans of nails and screws and stacked against another wall were endless tubs of grease greasing a track eddie would say required no more brains than washing a dish the only difference was you got dirtier as you did it not cleaner and that was the sort of work that eddie did spread grease adjusted brakes tightened bolts checked electrical panels many times he had longed to leave this place find different work build another kind of life but the war came his plans never worked out in time he found himself graying and wearing looser pants and in a state of weary acceptance that this was who he was and who he would always be a man with sand in his shoes in a world of mechanical laughter and grilled frankfurters like his father before him like the patch on his shirt eddie was maintenance the head of maintenance or as the kids sometimes called him quotthe ride man at ruby pierquot thirty minutes left quothey happy birthday i hearquot dominguez said eddie grunted quotno party or nothingquot eddie looked at him as if he were crazy for a moment he thought how strange it was to be growing old in a place that smelled of cotton candy quotwell remember eddie im off next week starting monday going to mexicoquot eddie nodded and dominguez did a little dance quotme and theresa gonna see the whole family parrrtyquot he stopped dancing when he noticed eddie staring quotyou ever beenquot dominguez said quotbeenquot quotto mexicoquot eddie exhaled through his nose quotkid i never been anywhere i wasnt shipped to with a riflequot he watched dominguez return to the sink he thought for a moment then he took a small wad of bills from his pocket and removed the only twenties he had two of them he held them out quotget your wife something nicequot eddie said dominguez regarded the money broke into a huge smile and said quotcmon man you surequot eddie pushed the money into dominguezs palm then he walked out back to the storage area a small quotfishing holequot had been cut into the boardwalk planks years ago and eddie lifted the plastic cap he tugged on a nylon line that dropped 80 feet to the sea a piece of bologna was still attached quotwe catch anythingquot dominguez yelled quottell me we caught somethingquot eddie wondered how the guy could be so optimistic there was never anything on that line quotone dayquot dominguez yelled quotwere gonna get a halibutquot quotyepquot eddie mumbled although he knew you could never pull a fish that big through a hole that small twentysix minutes to live eddie crossed the boardwalk to the south end business was slow the girl behind the taffy counter was leaning on her elbows popping her gum once ruby pier was the place to go in the summer it had elephants and fireworks and marathon dance contests but people didnt go to ocean piers much anymore they went to theme parks where you paid 75 a ticket and had your photo taken with a giant furry character eddie limped past the bumper cars and fixed his eyes on a group of teenagers leaning over the railing great he told himself just what i need quotoffquot eddie said tapping the railing with his cane quotcmon its not safequot the teens glared at him the car poles sizzled with electricity zzzap zzzap sounds quotits not safequot eddie repeated the teens looked at each other one kid who wore a streak of orange in his hair sneered at eddie then stepped onto the middle rail quotcome on dudes hit mequot he yelled waving at the young drivers quothit m quot eddie whacked the railing so hard with his cane he almost snapped it in two quotmove itquot the teens ran away another story went around about eddie as a soldier he had engaged in combat numerous times hed been brave even won a medal but toward the end of his service he got into a fight with one of his own men thats how eddie was wounded no one knew what happened to the other guy no one asked with 19 minutes left on earth eddie sat for the last time in an old aluminum beach chair his short muscled arms folded like a seals flippers across his chest his legs were red from the sun and his left knee still showed scars in truth much of eddies body suggested a survived encounter his fingers were bent at awkward angles thanks to numerous fractures from assorted machinery his nose had been broken several times in what he called quotsaloon fightsquot his broadly jawed face might have been goodlooking once the way a prizefighter might have looked before he took too many punches now eddie just looked tired this was his regular spot on the ruby pier boardwalk behind the jackrabbit ride which in the 1980s was the thunderbolt which in the 1970s was the steel eel which in the 1960s was the lollipop swings which in the 1950s was laff in the dark and which before that was the stardust band shell which was where eddie met marguerite every life has one truelove snapshot for eddie it came on a warm september night after a thunderstorm when the boardwalk was spongy with water she wore a yellow cotton dress with a pink barrette in her hair eddie didnt say much he was so nervous he felt as if his tongue were glued to his teeth they danced to the music of a big band long legs delaney and his everglades orchestra he bought her a lemon fizz she said she had to go before her parents got angry but as she walked away she turned and waved that was the snapshot for the rest of his life whenever he thought of marguerite eddie would see that moment her waving over her shoulder her dark hair falling over one eye and he would feel the same arterial burst of love that night he came home and woke his older brother he told him hed met the girl he was going to marry quotgo to sleep eddiequot his brother groaned whrrrssssh a wave broke on the beach eddie coughed up something he did not want to see he spat it away whrrssssssh he used to think a lot about marguerite not so much now she was like a wound beneath an old bandage and he had grown more used to the bandage whrrssssssh what was shingles whrrrsssssh sixteen minutes to live no story sits by itself sometimes stories meet at corners and sometimes they cover one another completely like stones beneath a river the end of eddies story was touched by another seemingly innocent story months earlier a cloudy night when a young man arrived at ruby pier with three of his friends the young man whose name was nicky had just begun driving and was still not comfortable carrying a key chain so he removed the single car key and put it in his jacket pocket then tied the jacket around his waist for the next few hours he and his friends rode all the fastest rides the flying falcon the splashdown freddys free fall the ghoster coaster quothands in the airquot one of them yelled they threw their hands in the air later when it was dark they returned to the car lot exhausted and laughing drinking beer from brown paper bags nicky reached into his jacket pocket he fished around he cursed the key was gone fourteen minutes until his death eddie wiped his brow with a handkerchief out on the ocean diamonds of sunlight danced on the water and eddie stared at their nimble movement he had not been right on his feet since the war but back at the stardust band shell with marguerite there eddie had still been graceful he closed his eyes and allowed himself to summon the song that brought them together the one judy garland sang in that movie it mixed in his head now with the cacophony of the crashing waves and children screaming on the rides quotyou made me love you quot whsssshhhh quot do it i didnt want to do i quot splllllaaaaashhhhhhh quot me love you quot eeeeeeee quot time you knew it and all the quot chhhhewisshhhh quot knew it quot eddie felt her hands on his shoulders he squeezed his eyes tightly to bring the memory closer twelve minutes to live quotscuse mequot a young girl maybe eight years old stood before him blocking his sunlight she had blonde curls and wore flipflops and denim cutoff shorts and a lime green tshirt with a cartoon duck on the front amy he thought her name was amy or annie shed been here a lot this summer although eddie never saw a mother or father quotscuuuse mequot she said again quoteddie maintnancequot eddie sighed quotjust eddiequot he said quoteddiequot quotum hmmquot quotcan you make me quot she put her hands together as if praying quotcmon kiddo i dont have all dayquot quotcan you make me an animal can youquot eddie looked up as if he had to think about it then he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out three yellow pipe cleaners which he carried for just this purpose quotyesssssquot the little girl said slapping her hands eddie began twisting the pipe cleaners quotwheres your parentsquot quotriding the ridesquot quotwithout youquot the girl shrugged quotmy moms with her boyfriendquot eddie looked up oh he bent the pipe cleaners into several small loops then twisted the loops around one another his hands shook now so it took longer than it used to but soon the pipe cleaners resembled a head ears body and tail quota rabbitquot the little girl said eddie winked quotthaaaank youquot she spun away lost in that place where kids dont even know their feet are moving eddie wiped his brow again then closed his eyes slumped into the beach chair and tried to get the old song back into his head a seagull squawked as it flew overhead how do people choose their final words do they realize their gravity are they fated to be wise by his 83rd birthday eddie had lost nearly everyone hed cared about some had died young and some had been given a chance to grow old before a disease or an accident took them away at their funerals eddie listened as mourners recalled their final conversations quotits as if he knew he was going to die quot some would say eddie never believed that as far as he could tell when your time came it came and that was that you might say something smart on your way out but you might just as easily say something stupid for the record eddies final words would be quotget backquot here are the sounds of eddies last minutes on earth waves crashing the distant thump of rock music the whirring engine of a small biplane dragging an ad from its tail and this quotoh my god lookquot eddie felt his eyes dart beneath his lids over the years he had come to know every noise at ruby pier and could sleep through them all like a lullaby this voice was not in the lullaby quotoh my god lookquot eddie bolted upright a woman with fat dimpled arms was holding a shopping bag and pointing and screaming a small crowd gathered around her their eyes to the skies eddie saw it immediately atop freddys free fall the new quottower dropquot attraction one of the carts was tilted at an angle as if trying to dump its cargo four passengers two men two women held only by a safety bar were grabbing frantically at anything they could quotoh my godquot the fat woman yelled quot those people theyre gonna fall quot a voice squawked from the radio on eddies belt quoteddie eddiequot he pressed the button quoti see it get securityquot people ran up from the beach pointing as if they had practiced this drill look up in the sky an amusement ride turned evil eddie grabbed his cane and clomped to the safety fence around the platform base his wad of keys jangling against his hip his heart was racing freddys free fall was supposed to drop two carts in a stomachchurning descent only to be halted at the last instant by a gush of hydraulic air how did one cart come loose like that it was tilted just a few feet below the upper platform as if it had started downward then changed its mind eddie reached the gate and had to catch his breath dominguez came running and nearly banged into him quotlisten to mequot eddie said grabbing dominguez by the shoulders his grip was so tight dominguez made a pained face quotlisten to me whos up therequot quotwilliequot quotok he mustve hit the emergency stop thats why the cart is hanging get up the ladder and tell willie to manually release the safety restraint so those people can get out ok its on the back of the cart so youre gonna have to hold him while he leans out there ok then then the two of yas the two of yas now not one you got it the two of yas get them out one holds the other got it got it quot dominguez nodded quickly quotthen send that damn cart down so we can figure out what happenedquot eddies head was pounding although his park had been free of any major accidents he knew the horror stories of his business once in brighton a bolt unfastened on a gondola ride and two people fell to their death another time in wonderland park a man had tried to walk across a roller coaster track he fell through and got stuck beneath his armpits he was wedged in screaming and the cars came racing toward him and well that was the worst eddie pushed that from his mind there were people all around him now hands over their mouths watching dominguez climb the ladder eddie tried to remember the insides of freddys free fall engine cylinders hydraulics seals cables how does a cart come loose he followed the ride visually from the four frightened people at the top down the towering shaft and into the base engine cylinders hydraulics seals cables dominguez reached the upper platform he did as eddie told him holding willie as willie leaned toward the back of the cart to release the restraint one of the female riders lunged for willie and nearly pulled him off the platform the crowd gasped quotwait quot eddie said to himself willie tried again this time he popped the safety release quotcable quot eddie mumbled the bar lifted and the crowd went quotahhhhhquot the riders were quickly pulled to the platform quotthe cable is unraveling quot and eddie was right inside the base of freddys free fall hidden from view the cable that lifted cart no 2 had for the last few months been scraping across a locked pulley because it was locked the pulley had gradually ripped the cables steel wires as if husking an ear of corn until they were nearly severed no one noticed how could they notice only someone who had crawled inside the mechanism would have seen the unlikely cause of the problem the pulley was wedged by a small object that must have fallen through the opening at a most precise moment a car key quotd ont release the cartquot eddie yelled he waved his arms quothey heeeey its the cable dont release the cart itll snapquot the crowd drowned him out it cheered wildly as willie and dominguez unloaded the final rider all four were safe they hugged atop the platform quotdom williequot eddie yelled someone banged against his waist knocking his walkietalkie to the ground eddie bent to get it willie went to the controls he put his finger on the green button eddie looked up quotno no no dontquot eddie turned to the crowd quotget backquot something in eddies voice must have caught the peoples attention they stopped cheering and began to scatter an opening cleared around the bottom of freddys free fall and eddie saw the last face of his life she was sprawled upon the rides metal base as if someone had knocked her into it her nose running tears filling her eyes the little girl with the pipecleaner animal amy annie quotma mom mom quot she heaved almost rhythmically her body frozen in the paralysis of crying children quotma mom ma mom quot eddies eyes shot from her to the carts did he have time her to the carts whump too late the carts were dropping jesus he released the brake and for eddie everything slipped into watery motion he dropped his cane and pushed off his bad leg and felt a shot of pain that almost knocked him down a big step another step inside the shaft of freddys free fall the cable snapped its final thread and ripped across the hydraulic line cart no 2 was in a dead drop now nothing to stop it a boulder off a cliff in those final moments eddie seemed to hear the whole world distant screaming waves music a rush of wind a low loud ugly sound that he realized was his own voice blasting through his chest the little girl raised her arms eddie lunged his bad leg buckled he half flew half stumbled toward her landing on the metal platform which ripped through his shirt and split open his skin just beneath the patch that read eddie and maintenance he felt two hands in his own two small hands a stunning impact a blinding flash of light and then nothing
