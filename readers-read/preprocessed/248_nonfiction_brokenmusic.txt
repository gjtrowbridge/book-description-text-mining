 music has always been my refuge from sadness the guitar i inherited from my uncle john now has decent strings and im no longer making the broken music that so upset my grandmother in fact im making a lot of progress but the limitations of my first instrument are holding me back there are things that i simply cant do with this primitive heirloom from the money i earned on the milk rounds i have saved up enough for a new acoustic guitar that ive had my eye on it has been hanging from the wall in braidfords music shop for three months now i go and see it after school every evening praying that no one has bought it it is a beautiful steelstringed instrument with a blond finish an ebony fingerboard and delicate marquetry inlaid around the sound hole it costs me sixteen guineas which is a large amount of money but im in love for the very first time i first heard the beatles in my final year at junior school i remember being in the changing rooms of the swimming baths mr law had just supervised one of our chaotic and impossibly noisy trips to the bathsby supervised i mean that no one had actually been drowned we were drying ourselves off and as was our custom flicking towels at each others genitals it was at this point that we heard the first bars of love me do from a transistor radio in the corner the effect was immediate there was something in the sparseness of the sound that immediately put a stop to the horseplay johns lonely harmonica and pauls bass played two to the bar and then the vocal harmony moved in modal fifths up to minor thirds and back again to a solo voice on the refrain not that i could articulate any of this at the time but i recognized something significant even revolutionary in the spare economy of the sound and the interesting thing is so did everyone else by the time she loves you reached number one in the charts i was already at the grammar school but it wasnt the confident primitivism of the yeah yeah yeah chorus that excited me so much as the g major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda again i couldnt articulate this then but i knew as the g major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda an old dance band clich but when the beatles used it there seemed to be a subtle irony at work again i couldnt articulate this then but i knew instinctively that it was pointing to a level of sophistication that i hadnt been aware of in pop music until then the beatles would succeed in manipulating as many musical forms into their songs whether classical folk rock and roll the blues indian raga or vaudeville in a dizzying and seamless pastiche of ideas and cultural references it was music without frontiers and the ubiquitous soundtrack for a generation that thought it could change the world jim berryman in his otherwise excellent biography a sting in the tale claims that i was outside the city hall when the fab four played there in 1963 and that i managed to grab a lock of mccartneys hair this is of course fantasy and would have been out of keeping with the budding intellectual pretensions that i was nurturing at the time but it is impossible to stress too much the influence that the beatles had on my early life and the fact that they came from a similar background to my own was fundamental to the vague plans of escape and glory that i was hatching in my imagination lennon and mccartney were both grammar school boys from humble roots in liverpool a town not dissimilar from newcastle from their initial chart successes they went on to conquer the world with songs that they wrote themselves this gave an entire generation of musicians the confidence and permission to at least attempt the same feat i pore over beatles albums with the same obsessive and forensic scrutiny that id applied to rodgers and hammerstein only now i have a guitar i have an instrument that can reproduce the practical magic of the chord structures and the network of riffs that their songs are built on and what songs one after the other album after album i learn to play them all confident that if i persevere what i cant play immediately will yield its secret eventually i will reapply the needle of the record player again and again to the bars of music that seem beyond my analysis like a safecracker picking a lock until the prize is mine no school subject ever occupies as much of my time or energy im not claiming that any kind of prescience about the future is at work here but there is something in the driven and compulsive nature of this obsession that is unusual something in the unconscious saying this is how you escape this is how you escape it is 1966 and england having won the world cup against germany that summer is at last enjoying the fruits of the postwar boom and is considered to be in the quaint argot of the time swinging in newcastle however the hedonism of social change and cultural revolution is limited to a small enclave surrounding the university kings college gives the pubs and clubs and bookshops an air of musty intellectualism and bohemian sophistication wittgenstein of all people is supposed to have spent some time in the city during the wari can just see him trying to explain the more difficult passages of tractatus logicophilosophicus to the coves in the haymarket snug in a blue haze of woodbines and brown ale the club a gogo is above some shops in percy street behind the haymarket it was originally a jazz club catering to the sophisticated tastes that developed in and around the university the gogo is where the animals had their residency before they hit the big time and living proof that the beatles miracle could be repeated even in newcastle when i am fifteen years old the first live band i ever see is there the graham bond organisation it is a fortunate introduction graham bond is a big roundfaced man with long greasy hair and a mandarin mustache he plays hammond organ and alto sax and sings in a gruff and passionate baritone his band contains figures who will soon become legends jack bruce and ginger baker who will become more famous as members of cream on bass and drums respectively and dick heckstallsmith on tenor the music is harsh and uncompromising and im not sure if i like it but i have a strong sense that what is being played has a weight and a seriousness that will later be characterized and then caricatured as heavy graham bond would later become obsessed with the occult and end his own life under a train in londons underground i go to see john mayalls bluesbreakers again at the gogo although i dont remember which of their subsequently legendary guitarists was on duty that night it certainly wasnt clapton though it may have been peter green but it wasnt until december of that year that i really had my mind blown i would watch top of the pops with a religious devotion at 730 every thursday evening i loved this show with a passion almost forty years later i can still see a picture of the dj jimmy savile standing in front of a large chart of the top twenty circa 1966 and am able to sing a line from every entry such familiarity with the music of the time could not however have prepared me for the whirlwind the tidal wave the earthquake the force of nature that was jimi hendrix the jimi hendrix experience appeared on top of the pops in december of 1966 and changed everything hendrix had transformed hey joe an old folk song and propelled it by the elegant ferocity of his guitar playing into a sassy bluesy vehicle of awesome power his vocal was as sulky and offhand as it was passionate and openly sexual and as the threepiece band stormed through the threeminute song i imagined everyone in whole country in front of their tellys sitting bolt upright in their chairs wow what the fuck was that it seemed only days later that he would be booked to appear at the gogo the excitement in the town is palpable i am technically too young to gain admission to a nightclub but because of my height i can easily pass for eighteen i have brought a change of clothes in my schoolbag a pair of levis and a white ben sherman shirt with a buttondown collar these are the coolest clothes i have and look fine under my school overcoat i change out of my uniform in the toilets at the central station trying not to breathe the lavatory is foul with the pungent stench of urine and sadness i dress with mesmeric slowness not wanting to drop any of my clothes on the filthy floor beneath a faded ministry of health poster warning of the dangers of vd some hope i still havent come close to having sex there are no girls at school and most of my evenings are taken up traveling home on trains and buses when i do get home i usually have a punitive amount of work to do and when on those rare opportunities i do meet girls i am painfully shy and havent a clue what to say but the other reason is music i already have my passion i stow my bag in the lockers at the station and set off at a brisk pace for percy street breathing in the crisp air of the evening in grateful gulps and anticipating something extraordinary there is a long queue stretching around the corner i tuck myself into the end of the line and wait i imagine im one of the youngest people there although my height allows me some anonymity in the crowd they are mainly boys dressed much the same as me although a few dandified exotics have managed to purchase afghan coats and are sporting droopy zapata mustaches and spiffy desert boots the girls all have the same style hair parted severely in the middle and falling in lank sheets to the shoulders of black leather coats there is an atmosphere of seriousness though that pervades the crowd as if we are about to witness an event of high cultural significance hendrix will play two sets i manage to scrape in for the first one which is fortunate as i would have had to find some convincing excuse to stay out so late for the second my parents have no idea where i am and i have no wish to tell them one of the dividends of my alienation is that i dont have much explaining to do and am pretty much left to my own devices the club is tiny and i secure a pitch for myself halfway between the stage and the back wall i will have no trouble seeing the band of course are late the crowd waits patiently they say that if you remember the sixties then you werent there well much the same could be said of this gig the jimi hendrix experience was an overwhelming deafening wave of sound that simply obliterated analysis i think i remember snatches of hey joe and foxy lady but that event remains a blur of noise and breathtaking virtuosity of afrod hair wild clothes and towers of marshall amplifiers it was also the first time id ever seen a black man i remember hendrix creating a hole in the plaster ceiling above the stage with the head of his guitar and then it was over i lay in my bed that night with my ears ringing and my worldview significantly altered i did enough schoolwork to get by but no more all i wanted to do was play the guitar and listen to records i listened exhaustively to dylan and memorized great tracts of his lyricism from the lonesome death of hattie carroll to gates of eden i also learned to like jazz the hard way i developed a number of friendships with older boys in the school who recognized the seriousness of my musical obsessions one of them lent me two albums by thelonious monk monk live at olympia in paris and monk solo i was at first baffled by the angular complexity of the melodies and the density of the underlying harmonies but had an inkling that there was something important here i persevered in the same way i persevered with the books my grandmother lent me or the way i figured out how to play the guitar pragmatically unschooled but determined i had no intellectual approach just sheer bloodymindedness i would come home from school put monk on begin my homework and let the music teach me by osmosis as i struggled with some abstruse geometry proof when i heard miles davis and john coltrane i realized that these musicians were exploring the outer reaches of human understanding like physicists in a sound laboratory i wonder if i would have developed even a small understanding of such music if i hadnt first put the time and effort into listening i am no jazz musician but ive put in enough work to have some understanding of it and develop a common language with those who do play it by 1967 my parents have saved enough money to move the family to a semidetached house near the coast in tynemouth only a few miles downriver from wallsend after all these years theyre miraculously still together or at least nominally so being under the same roof divorce simply isnt an option for people like us either financially or socially it just isnt done im relieved that we havent had to deal with the seismic upheaval of a divorce but sometimes exhausted by the constant emotional static that crackles and then festers just below the surface of the house i wish the whole thing would just blow itself skyhigh once and for all i am too awkward and clumsy to be much good at football but i can run no one has ever beaten me over one hundred yards at any of the schools i have attended i am bigboned and strong from all the exercise i get working with my dad and of course all the free milk i hold the school record for the hundred yards and have qualified for the northumberland county championships in ashington it is the summer of 1967 and i am sixteen this is the biggest race of my life i can recall the nausea of waiting for the starting pistol the agony of the silences between the instructions on your marks my spiked feet in their blocks measuring the distance between my left knee and my fingertips get set now an eternity as i raise my head and push back on my hips and stare down the long tunnel to the finishing line bang i return home that evening flushed with pride and victory having won the race by a good length and blurting out the news of my triumph to my father who is rousing himself from his afternoon sleep on the sofa thats very nice son is his only response before he drifts off to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea i am at first deflated and then angry at him he is too embedded in his own unhappiness to be able to really share in my success or take pride in it as something that he himself helped to create his pride in me will continue to be ossified in the bones of his sadness unvoiced i understand this now but i didnt then my running career ends that summer after i am beaten for the first time in the early rounds of a national tournament i have lost heart in the sport consoling myself with the knowledge that there is no strategy involved in sprinting no real tactical training you are either born with the right musculature to be the fastest or you are not excellence in sports is cruelly definitive and this is the nausea in the pit of your stomach and in your throat this is the fearthat you will not be good enough that you will be beaten that you will fail i begin to fantasize that i will no longer seek my fathers attention and yet a lot of my life has been nothing but a vain attempt to find approval to find acceptance and no matter how full my belly i wonder will i always feel hungry while i despise the new house and its suburban pretensions it does have a garden which my dad loves though he has to get up even earlier and drive back to wallsend to do his round he builds what he calls a conservatory in the back garden but in reality its a jerrybuilt shed with windows he spends most of his days in there with the spiders and some sadlooking cactuses my mother still goes out on a thursday night to an undisclosed location assumed to be nancys house but nothing is ever said the walls are too thin for voices to be raised we are like a family of trappists cloistered in our own silences i cant be much of an elder brother to my siblings im sure theyre as confused as i am because when im not actually missing from the house im just emotionally absent for although i love them dearly and i think they love me i cant really express any interest in them or risk any emotion they must think im a cold fish but i have no idea what they know or what they can tolerate i share a back bedroom with my brother and a view of the oceanthat is it has a view of the ocean if you climb on top of the wardrobe and peer over the rooftops and there in the distance will be the gray forbidding horizon of the north sea i get out as much as i can i will use up whole days wandering up and down the beaches from tynemouth to whitley bay drifting with the tides aimlessly walking and thinking i begin to spend a lot of my evenings at the ymca in whitley bay and befriend two brothers ken and pete brigham ken like me goes to a grammar school in newcastle he is an excellent musician and plays piano and guitar pete who is a couple of years older than we are is an apprentice chef and plays the bass pete has actually built this instrument himself and i am stunned by his ingenuity the bass is functional without being crude utilitarian without being ugly he explains to me the electronic mysteries of the singlecoil pickup the mathematics of scale length and the crucial distances between the frets on the fingerboard this will be my first introduction to the cult of the bass guitar i have not really taken much interest in the instrument regarding myself exclusively as a lead guitarist because i could now make passable attempts at hendrix riffs using this new skill to inveigle my way into the coterie of young musicians who gather in the music room most weeknights i am the kid who can play purple haze and this becomes my calling card from such small beginnings reputations are made i probably teach that riff to half the kids in the ym one of these kids is keith gallagher who will be the best man at my wedding as i will be at his a lifelong friend and an early supporter it is with his enthusiasm encouragement that i dare to imagine that i have something that sets me apart as a musician that somehow the dream can be nurtured into reality keith has a practical nature he is apprenticed to an engineering firm in newcastle and attends night school he also had the ambition and tenacity to get a good degree and eventually become a leading consultant engineer although my convoluted route to success will be far less structured we must have recognized in each other similar traits similar desires to escape the confined world of our parents we walk the beaches together talking and fantasizing sometimes until the early hours of the morning keith is the first person to hear my early songwriting efforts and although they are probably awful he shows just enough interest to encourage me to carry on he did remind me recently that one of my earliest efforts concerned a flower in the desert i had long forgotten this before i came to write a song called desert rose which would sell over a million copies thirtyfive years later it still seems fantastic to me that something as private as a song can become public property but maybe all it takes is just one person to believe in what you are doing to give you the confidence to keep trying while keith is my svengali it is ken the younger of the brigham brothers who will be my mentor we learn old freddie king numbers like the stumble and hide away note for note and play these tunes ad nauseam brother pete plods away on the bass while ken and i wheedle and deedle our way through the blues we go to see peter green in fleetwood mac stan webb in chicken shack and john mayalls bluesbreakers feeding our fantasies that we too can become bluesmen when we arent playing in the ym we are practicing up in kens bedroom which is in the attic of a victorian terraced house near the seafront one night pete has a date and wont be able to do the honors on bass so i nobly volunteer to take up the support role while ken wheedles and deedles the bass feels strange in your hands when youve been used to the smaller instrument with its narrow strings and short neck the bass has a weight and a heft to it that feels like a weapon yet there is a quiet beauty to it as well this instrument is the root of all harmony the bedrock at the bottom of the stave upon which music is constructed when i accompanied ken i realized that whatever he played was harmonically defined by the notes on the bass if he were to play the upper partials of a c chord on the guitar it would only be a c chord if i played c in the bass so i began to form in my mind what i can only describe as a strategy a vague one but nonetheless a strategy that the bass while being far from flashy would suit the covert side of my personality much better than the guitar it would be a quieter heroism i would seek stoic and grounded like my fathers my ambitions would become concrete from the ground up hidden yet effective i would suppress my desire to shine spectacularly in favor of digging deep and marking time in what i somehow knew would become a lifelong campaign
