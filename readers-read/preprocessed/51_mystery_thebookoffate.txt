 six minutes from now one of us would be dead that was our fate none of us knew it was coming 147 ron hold up 148 i called out chasing after the middleaged man in the navyblue suit as i ran the smothering florida heat glued my shirt to my chest ignoring me ron boyle darted up the tarmac passing air force one on our right and the eighteen cars of the motorcade that idled in a singlefile line on our left as deputy chief of staff he was always in a rush that146s what happens when you work for the most powerful man in the world i don146t say that lightly our boss was the commander in chief the president of the united states and when he wanted something it was my job to get it right now president leland 147the lion148 manning wanted boyle to stay calm some tasks were beyond even me picking up speed as he weaved through the crowd of staffers and press making their way to their assigned cars boyle blew past a shiny black chevy suburban packed with secret service agents and the ambulance that carried extra pints of the president146s blood earlier today boyle was supposed to have a fifteenminute sitdown with the president on air force one because of my scheduling error he was now down to a threeminute driveby briefing sometime this afternoon to say he was annoyed would be like calling the great depression a bad day at the office 147ron148 i said again putting a hand on his shoulder and trying to apologize 147just wait i wanted to151148 he spun around wildly slapping my hand out of the way thin and pointynosed with a thick mustache designed to offset both boyle had graying hair olive skin and striking brown eyes with a splash of light blue in each iris as he leaned forward his cat146s eyes glared down at me 147don146t touch me again unless you146re shaking my hand148 he threatened as a flick of spit hit me in the cheek gritting my teeth i wiped it away with the back of my hand sure the scheduling hiccup was my fault but that146s still no reason t151 147now what the hell146s so damn important wes or is this another vital reminder that when we146re eating with the president we need to give you our lunch orders at least an hour in advance148 he added loud enough so a few secret service agents turned any other twentythreeyearold would146ve taken a verbal swing i kept my cool that146s the job of the president146s aide aka the body person aka the buttboy get the president what he wants keep the machine humming 147lemme make it up to you148 i said mentally canceling my apology if i wanted boyle quiet151if we didn146t want a scene for the press151i needed to up the ante 147what if i what if i squeezed you into the president146s limo right now148 boyle146s posture lifted slightly as he started buttoning his suit jacket 147i thought you151no that146s good great excellent148 he even painted on a tiny smile crisis averted he thought all was forgiven my memory146s way longer than that as boyle triumphantly turned toward the limo i jotted down another mental note cocky bastard on the way home he146d be riding in the back of the press van politically i wasn146t just good i was great that146s not ego it146s the truth you don146t apply for this job you146re invited to interview every young political gunner in the white house would146ve killed to clutch this close to the leader of the free world from here my predecessor had gone on to become the number two guy in the white house press office his predecessor in the last white house took a job managing four thousand people at ibm seven months ago despite my lack of connections the president picked me i beat out a senator146s son and a pair of rhodes scholars i could certainly handle a tantrumthrowing senior staffer 147wes let146s go148 the secret service detail leader called out waving us into the car as he slid into the front passenger seat where he could see everything coming trailing boyle and holding my leather shoulder bag out in front of me i jumped into the back of the armored limo where the president was dressed casually in a black windbreaker and jeans i assumed boyle would immediately start talking his ear off but as he passed in front of the president he was strangely silent hunched over as he headed for the back left seat boyle146s suit jacket sagged open but he quickly pressed his hand over his own heart to keep it shut i didn146t realize until later what he was hiding or what i146d just done by inviting him inside following behind him i crouched toward one of the three folddown seats that face the rear of the car mine was backtoback with the driver and across from boyle for security reasons the president always sat in the back right seat with the first lady sitting between him and boyle the jump seat directly across from the president151the hot seat151was already taken by mike calinoff retired professional race car driver fourtime winston cup winner and special guest for today146s event no surprise with only four months until the election we were barely three points ahead in the polls when the crowd was that fickle only a fool entered the gladiator146s ring without a hidden weapon 147so she146s fast even with the bulletproofing148 the racing champ asked admiring the midnightblue interior of cadillac one 147greased lightning148 manning answered as the first lady rolled her eyes finally joining in boyle scootched forward in his seat and flipped open a manila folder 147mr president if we could151148 147sorry151that146s all i can do sir148 chief of staff warren albright interrupted as he hopped inside handing a foldedup newspaper to the president he took the middle seat directly across from the first lady and more important diagonally across from manning even in a sixperson backseat proximity mattered especially to boyle who was still turned toward the president refusing to give up his opening the president seized the newspaper and scrutinized the crossword puzzle he and albright shared every day it had been their tradition since the first days of the campaign151and the reason why albright was always in that coveted seat diagonally across from the president albright started each puzzle got as far as he could then passed it to the president to cross the finish line 147fifteen down146s wrong148 the president pointed out as i rested my bag on my lap 147stifle148 albright usually hated when manning found a mistake today as he noticed boyle in the corner seat he had something brandnew to be annoyed by everything okay i asked with a glance before albright could answer the driver rammed the gas and my body jerked forward three and a half minutes from now the first gunshot would be fired two of us would crumble to the floor convulsing one wouldn146t get up 147sir if i could bend your ear for a second148 boyle interrupted more insistently than before 147ron can146t you just enjoy the ride148 the first lady teased her short brown hair bobbing as we hit a divot in the road despite the sweet tone i saw the glare in her leafgreen eyes it was the same glare she used to give her students at princeton a former professor with a phd in chemistry dr first lady was trained to be tough and what dr first lady wanted dr first lady fought for and got 147but ma146am it146ll just take151148 her brow furrowed so hard her eyebrows kissed 147ron enjoy the ride 148 that146s where most people would146ve stopped boyle pushed even harder trying to hand the file directly to manning he146d known the president since they were in their twenties studying at oxford a professional banker as well as a collector of antique magic tricks he later managed all of the mannings146 money a magic trick in itself to this day he was the only person on staff who was there when manning married the first lady that alone gave him a free pass when the press discovered that boyle146s father was a petty con man who146d been convicted twice for insurance fraud it was the same free pass he was using in the limo to test the first lady146s authority but even the best free passes eventually expire manning shook his head so subtly only a trained eye could see it first lady one boyle nothing closing the file folder boyle sank back and shot me the kind of look that would leave a bruise now it was my fault as we neared our destination manning stared silently through the light green tint of his bulletproof window 147y146ever hear what kennedy said three hours before he was shot148 he asked putting on his best massachusetts accent 147 you know last night would146ve been a hell of a night to kill a president 148 147 lee 148 the first lady scolded 147see what i deal with148 she added fake laughing at calinoff the president took her hand and squeezed it glancing my way 147wes did you bring the present i got for mr calinoff148 he asked i dug through my leather briefcase151the bag of tricks151never taking my eyes off manning146s face he tossed a slight nod and scratched at his own wrist don146t give him the tie clip go for the big stuff i146d been his aide for over seven months if i was doing my job right we didn146t have to talk to communicate we were in a groove i couldn146t help but smile that was my last big broad grin in three minutes the gunman146s third bullet would rip through my cheek destroying so many nerves i146d never have full use of my mouth again that146s the one the president nodded at me from my overpacked bag which held everything a president would ever need i pulled out a set of official presidential cuff links which i handed to mr calinoff who was loving every split second in his foldeddown completely uncomfortable hot seat 147those are real y146know148 the president told him 147don146t put 146em on ebay148 it was the same joke he used every time he gave a set away we all still laughed even boyle who started scratching at his chest there146s no better place to be than in on an inside joke with the president of the united states and on july 4th in daytona florida when you146d flown in to yell 147 gentlemen start your engines 148 at the legendary pepsi 400 nascar race there was no better backseat in the world before calinoff could offer a thankyou the limo came to a stop a red lightning bolt flashed by us on the left151two police motorcycles with their sirens blaring they were leapfrogging from the back of the motorcade to the front just like a funeral procession 147don146t tell me they closed down the road148 the first lady said she hated it when they shut traffic for the motorcade those were the votes we146d never get back the car slowly chugged a few feet forward 147sir we146re about to enter the track148 the detail leader announced from the passenger seat outside the concrete openness of the airport runway quickly gave way to rows and rows of highend motor coaches 147wait we146re going out on the track148 calinoff asked suddenly excited he shifted in his seat trying to get a look outside the president grinned 147did you think we146d just get a couple seats in front148 the wheels bounced over a clanging metal plate that sounded like a loose manhole cover boyle scratched even more at his chest a baritone rumble filled the air 147that thunder148 boyle asked glancing up at the clear blue sky 147no not thunder148 the president replied putting his own fingertips against the bulletproof window as the stadium crowd of 200000 surged to its feet with banners flags and arms waving 147applause148 147 ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states 148 the announcer bellowed through the pa system a sharp righthand turn tugged us all sideways as the limo turned onto the racetrack the biggest most perfectly paved highway i146d ever seen in my life 147nice roads you got here148 the president said to calinoff leaning back in the plush leather seat that was tailormade to his body all that was left was the big entrance if we didn146t nail that the 200000 ticket holders in the stadium plus the ten million viewers watching from home plus the seventyfive million fans who146re committed to nascar would all go tell their friends and neighbors and cousins and strangers in the supermarket that we went up for our baptism and sneezed in the holy water but that146s why we brought the motorcade we didn146t need eighteen cars the runway in the daytona airport was actually adjacent to the racetrack there were no red lights to run no traffic to hold back but to everyone watching have you ever seen the president146s motorcade on a racetrack instant american frenzy i didn146t care how close we were in the polls one lap around and we146d be picking out our seats for the inauguration across from me boyle wasn146t nearly as thrilled with his arms crossed against his chest he never stopped studying the president 147got the stars out too eh148 calinoff asked as we entered the final turn and he saw our welcoming committee a small mob of nascar drivers all decked out in their multicolor advertisingemblazoned jumpsuits what his untrained eye didn146t notice were the dozen or so 147crew members148 who were standing a bit more erect than the rest some had backpacks some carried leather satchels all had sunglasses and one was speaking into his own wrist secret service like any other firsttimer in the limo calinoff was practically licking the glass 147mr calinoff you146ll be getting out first148 i told him as we pulled into the pit stalls outside the drivers were already angling for presidential position in sixty seconds they146d be running for their lives calinoff leaned toward my door on the driver146s side where all the nascar drivers were huddled i leaned forward to block him motioning to the president146s door on the other side 147 that way148 i said the door right next to him 147but the drivers are over there 148 calinoff objected 147listen to the boy148 the president chimed in gesturing toward the door by calinoff years ago when president clinton came for a nascar race members of the crowd booed in 2004 when president bush arrived with legendary driver bill elliott in his motorcade elliott stepped out first and the crowd erupted even presidents can use an opening act with a click and a thunk the detail leader pushed a small security button under the door handle which allowed him to open the armorlined door from the outside within seconds the door cracked open twin switchblades of light and florida heat sliced through the car and calinoff lowered one of his handmade cowboy boots onto the pavement 147and please welcome fourtime winston cup winner mike caaaalinoff148 the announcer shouted through the stadium cue crowd going wild 147never forget148 the president whispered to his guest as calinoff stepped outside to the 200000 screaming fans 147 that146s who we146re here to see148 147and now148 the announcer continued 147our grand marshal for today146s race151florida146s own president leeeee maaaaanning148 just behind calinoff the president hopped out of the car his right hand up in a wave his left hand proudly patting the nascar logo on the chest of his windbreaker he paused for a moment to wait for the first lady as always you could read the lips on every fan in the grandstands there he is there he is there they are then as soon as the crowd had digested it the flashbulbs hit mr president over here mr president he146d barely moved three steps by the time albright was behind him followed by boyle i stepped out last the sunlight forced me to squint but i still craned my neck to look up mesmerized by the 200000 fans who were now on their feet pointing and waving at us from the grandstands two years out of college and this was my life even rock stars don146t have it this good putting his arm out for a handshake calinoff was quickly enveloped by the waiting crowd of drivers who smothered him with hugs and backslaps at the front of the crowd was the nascar ceo and his surprisingly tall wife here to welcome the first lady approaching the drivers the president grinned he was next in three seconds he146d be surrounded151the one black windbreaker in a technicolor sea of pepsi mm146s dewalt and lone star steakhouse jumpsuits as if he146d won the world series the super bowl and the151 pop pop pop that146s all i heard three tiny pops a firecracker or a car backfiring 147shots fired shots fired148 the detail leader yelled 147 get down get back 148 i was still smiling as the first scream tore through the air the crowd of drivers scattered151running dropping panicking in an instant blur of colors 147 god gave power to the prophets 148 a man with black buzzed hair and a deep voice shouted from the center of the swirl his tiny chocolate eyes seemed almost too close together while his bulbous nose and arched thin eyebrows gave him a strange warmth that for some reason reminded me of danny kaye kneeling down on one knee and holding a gun with both hands he was dressed as a driver in a black and bright yellow racing jumpsuit like a bumblebee i thought 147 but also to the horrors 148 i just kept staring at him frozen sound disappeared time slowed and the world turned blackandwhite my own personal newsreel it was like the first day i met the president the handshake alone felt like an hour living between seconds someone called it time standing still still locked on the bumblebee i couldn146t tell if he was moving forward or if everyone around him was rushing back 147 man down 148 the detail leader shouted i followed the sound and the hand motions to a man in a navy suit lying facedown on the ground oh no boyle his forehead was pressed against the pavement his face screwed up in agony he was holding his chest and i could see blood starting to puddle out from below him 147 man down 148 the detail leader shouted again my eyes slid sideways searching for the president i found him just as a half dozen jumpsuited agents rushed at the small crowd that was already around him the frantic agents were moving so fast the people closest to manning were pinned against him 147move him now 148 an agent yelled pressed backward against the president the wife of the nascar ceo was screaming 147you146re crushing her148 manning shouted gripping her shoulder and trying to keep her on her feet 147let her go 148 the service didn146t care swarming around the president they rammed the crowd from the front and right side that146s when momentum got the best of them like a justcut tree the crush of people tumbled to the side toward the ground the president was still fighting to get the ceo146s wife out a bright light exploded i remember the flashbulb going off 147 so people could test their faith 148 the gunman roared as a separate group of agents in jumpsuits got a grip on his neck his arm the back of his hair in slow motion the bumblebee146s head snapped back then his body as two more pops ripped the air i felt a bee sting in my right cheek 147 and examine good from evil148 the man screamed arms spread out like jesus as agents dragged him to the ground all around them other agents formed a tight circle brandishing semiautomatic uzis they had torn from their leather satchels and backpacks i slapped my own face trying to kill whatever just bit me a few feet ahead the crowd surrounding the president collided with the asphalt two agents on the far side grabbed the first lady pulling her away the rest never stopped shoving ramming stepping over people as they tried to get to manning and shield him i looked as the puddle below boyle grew even larger his head was now resting in a milky white liquid he146d thrown up from the back of the president146s pile our detail leader and another suitandtie agent gripped manning146s elbows lifted him from the pile and shoved him sideways straight at me the president146s face was in pain i looked for blood on his suit but didn146t see any picking up speed his agents were going for the limo two more agents were right behind them gripping the first lady under her armpits i was the only thing in their way i tried to sidestep but wasn146t fast enough at full speed the detail leader146s shoulder plowed into my own falling backward i crashed into the limo my rear end hitting just above the right front tire i still see it all in some outofbody slow motion me trying to keep my balance slapping my hand against the car146s hood and the splat from my impact sound was so warped i could hear the liquid squish the world was still blackandwhite everything except for my own red handprint confused i put my hand back to my cheek it slid across my skin which was slick and wet and raw with pain 147go go go 148 someone screamed tires spun the car lurched and the limo sped out from under me like a soda can forgotten on the roof i tumbled backward crashing on my ass a crunch of rocks bit into my rear but all i could really feel was the ticktock ticktock pumping in my cheek i looked down at my palm seeing that my chest and right shoulder were soaked not by water thicker and darker dark red oh god is that my151 another flashbulb went off it wasn146t just the red of my blood i was seeing now there was blue on my tie and yellow yellow stripes on the road another flashbulb exploded as knives of color stabbed my eyes silver and brown and bright green race cars red white and blue flags abandoned in the grandstands a screaming blond boy in the third row with an aqua and orange miami dolphins tshirt and red the dark thick red all over my hand my arm my chest i again touched my cheek my fingertips scraped against something sharp like metal151or is that bone my stomach nosedived swirling with nausea i touched my face again with a slight push that thing wouldn146t budge what146s wrong with my fa151 two more flashbulbs blinded me with white and the world flew at me in fastforward time caught up in a fingersnap blurring at lightspeed 147i146m not feeling a pulse148 a deep voice yelled in the distance directly ahead two suitandtie secret service agents lifted boyle onto a stretcher and into the ambulance from the motorcade his right hand dangled downward bleeding from his palm i replayed the moments before the limo ride he would146ve never been in there if i hadn146t151 147he146s cuffed get the hell off148 a few feet to the left more agents screamed at the dogpile peeling layers away to get at the gunman i was on the ground with the rest of the grease stains struggling to stand up wondering why everything was so blurry help i called out though nothing left my lips the grandstands tilted like a kaleidoscope i fell backward crashing into the pavement lying there my palm still pressed against the slippery metal in my cheek 147is anyone151148 sirens sounded but they weren146t getting louder softer they quickly began to fade boyle146s ambulance leaving they146re leaving me 147please why isn146t 148 one woman screamed in a perfect c minor her howl pierced through the crowd as i stared up at the clear florida sky fireworks we were supposed to have fireworks albright146s gonna be pissed the sirens withered to a faint whistle i tried to lift my head but it didn146t move a final flashbulb hit and the world went completely white 147whwhy isn146t anyone helping me148 that day because of me ron boyle died eight years later he came back to life
