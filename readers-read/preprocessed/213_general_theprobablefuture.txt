 the vision i anyone born and bred in massachusetts learns early on to recognize the end of winter babies in their cribs point to the brightening of the sky before they can crawl levelheaded men weep at the first call of the warblers upstanding women strip off their clothes and dive into inlets and ponds before the ice has fully melted unconcerned if their fingers and toes turn blue spring fever affects young and old alike it spares no one and makes no distinctions striking when happiness is least expected when joy is only a memory when the skies are still cloudy and snow is still piled onto the cold hard ground who could blame the citizens of massachusetts for rejoicing when spring is so close at hand winter in new england is merciless and cruel a season that instills a particular melancholy in its residents and a hopelessness that is all but impossible to shake in the small towns surrounding boston the leaden skies and snowy vistas cause a temporary color blindness a condition that can be cured only by the appearance of the first green shoots of spring it isnt unusual for whole populations of certain towns to find they have tears in their eyes all through the month of march and there are those who insist they can see clearly for the very first time still there are some who are slower to discern the signs of spring they distrust march and declare it to be the most perilous time of the year these are the stubborn individuals who continue to wear woolen coats on the finest of days who insist it is impossible to tell the difference between a carpet of snowdrops and a stretch of ice in this slippery season even with twentytwenty vision such people cannot be convinced that lions will ever be turned into lambs in their opinion anyone born in march is sure to possess curious traits that mirror the fickle season hot one minute cold the next unreliable is marchs middle name no one could deny that its children are said to be just as unpredictable in some cases this is assuredly true for as long as their history has been known there have been only girl children born to the sparrow family and every one of these daughters has kept the family name and celebrated her birthday in march even those babies whose due dates were declared to be safely set within the snowy margins of february or the pale reaches of april managed to be born in march no matter when an infant was due to arrive as soon as the first snowdrops bloomed in new england a sparrow baby would begin to stir once leaves began to bud once the blue star crocus unfolded the womb could no longer contain one of these children not when spring fever was so very near and yet sparrow babies were as varied as the days of march some were calm and wideeyed born with open hands always the sign of a generous nature while others arrived squalling and agitated so full of outrage they were quickly bundled into blue blankets to ward off nervous ailments and apoplexy there were babies in the sparrow family who had been born while big soft snowflakes fell and boston harbor froze solid and those whose births took place on the mildest of days so that they drew their first breaths while the robins built nests out of straw and twigs and the red maples blushed with a first blooming but whether the season had been fair or foul in all this time there had been only one baby to be born feet first the mark of a healer and that child was stella sparrow avery for thirteen generations each one of the sparrow girls had come into this world with inky hair and dark moody eyes but stella was pale her ashy hair and hazel eyes inherited the labor nurses supposed from her handsome fathers side of the family hers was a difficult birth lifethreatening for both mother and child every attempt to turn the baby had failed and soon enough the doctors had begun to dread the outcome of the day the mother jenny avery an independent matteroffact woman who had run away from home at seventeen and was as unsentimental as she was selfreliant found herself screaming for her mother that she should cry for her mother who had been so distant and cold whom she hadnt even spoken to in more than a decade astounded jenny even more than the rigors of birth it was a wonder her mother wasnt able to hear her for although elinor sparrow was nearly fifty miles from boston jennys cries were piercing desperate enough to reach even the most remote and hardhearted women on the ward who had just begun their labor stuck their fingers in their ears and practiced their breathing techniques praying for an easier time orderlies wished they were home in bed with the covers drawn up patients in the cardiac unit felt their hearts race and down in the cafeteria the lemon puddings curdled and had to be thrown away at last the child arrived after seventeen hours of brutal labor the obstetrician in charge snapped one tiny shoulder to ease the birth for the mothers pulse was rapidly dropping it was at this very moment when the babys head slipped free and jenny avery thought she might lose consciousness that the cloudy sky cleared to reveal the silvery splash of the milky way the heart of the universe jenny blinked in the sudden light which poured in through the window she saw how beautiful the world was as though for the very first time the bowl of stars the black night the life of her child all came together in a single band of light jenny hadnt particularly wanted a baby she hadnt yearned for one the way some women did hadnt gazed longingly at rocking horses and cribs her stormy relationship with her own mother had made her wary of family ties and her marriage to will avery surely one of the most irresponsible men in new england hadnt seemed the proper setting in which to raise a child and yet it had happened this baby had arrived on a starry night in march the month of the sparrows season of snow and of spring of lions and lambs of endings and beginnings green month white month month of heartache month of extreme good luck the infants first cries werent heard until she was tucked into a flannel bunting then little yelps echoed from her tiny mouth as though she were a cat caught in a puddle the baby was easily soothed just a pat or two on the back from the doctor but it was too late her cries had gone right through jenny a hook piercing through blood and bones jenny sparrow avery was no longer aware of her husband or the nurses with whom he was flirting she didnt care about the blood on the floor or the trembling in her legs or even the milky way above them in the sky her eyes were filled with dizzying circles of light little pinpricks that glimmered inside her eyelids it wasnt starlight but something else entirely something she couldnt comprehend until the doctor handed her the child the damaged left shoulder taped up with white adhesive as though it were a broken wing jenny gazed into her childs calm face in that instant she experienced complete devotion then and there on the fifth floor of brigham and womens hospital she understood what it meant to be blinded by love the labor nurses soon crowded around cooing and praising the baby although they had seen hundreds of births this child was indeed exceptional it wasnt her pale hair or luminous complexion which distinguished her but her sweet temperament good as gold the nurses murmured approvingly quiet as ashes even the most jaded had to agree this child was special perhaps her character was a result of her birth date for jennys daughter had arrived on the twentieth of march the equinox when day and night are of equal length indeed in one tiny exhausted body there seemed to exist all of marchs traits the evens and the odds the dark and the light a child who would always be as comfortable with lions as she was with lambs jenny named the baby stella with wills approval of course for despite the many problems in the marriage on this one point they agreed this child was their radiant and wondrous star there was nothing jenny would not do for their daughter she who had not spoken to her own mother for years who had not so much as mailed a postcard back home after shed run off with will now felt powerless to resist the mighty forces of her own maternal instinct she was bewitched by this tiny creature the rest of the world fell away with a shudder leaving only their stella jennys child would not spend a single night apart from her even in the hospital she kept stella by her side rather than let her be brought to the nursery jenny sparrow avery knew exactly what could happen if you werent there to watch over your child she was quite aware of how wrong things could go between mothers and daughters not everyone was doomed to repeat history however family flaws and old sorrows neednt rule their lives or so jenny told herself every night as she checked on her sleeping daughter what was the past after all but a leaden shackle one had a duty to try and escape it was possible to break chains regardless of how old or how rusted of that jenny was certain it was possible to forge an entirely new life but chains made out of blood and memory were a thousand times more difficult to sever than those made of steel and the past could overtake a person if she wasnt careful a woman had to be vigilant or before she knew it shed find herself making the same mistakes her own mother had made with the same resentments set to boil jenny was not about to let herself relax or take the slightest bit of good fortune for granted there wasnt a day when she wasnt on guard let other mothers chat on the phone and hire babysitters let them sit on blankets in the boston common on sunny days and on blustery afternoons make angels in the snow jenny didnt have time for such nonsense she had only thirteen years in which to prevail over her familys legacy and she planned to do exactly that no matter the cost to herself in no time she became the sort of mother who made certain no drafts came in through the windows who saw to it that there were no latenight bedtimes or playing in the park on rainy days a sure cause of bronchitis and pleurisy cats were not allowed in the house too much dander dogs were avoided due to distemper not to mention allergies and fleas it did not matter if jenny took a job she despised at the bank on charles street or if her social life was nonexistent friends might fall away acquintances might come to avoid her her days of reviewing mortgage applications might bore her silly but jenny hardly cared about such distractions her only interest was stella she spent saturdays chopping up broccoli and kale for nourishing soups she sat up nights with stellas earaches stomachaches bouts of chicken pox and flu she laced boots and went over lessons and she never once complained disappointments fairweather friends math homework illnesses of every variety were dealt with and put in their proper place and if stella grew up to be a wary rather dour girl well wasnt that preferable to running wild the way jenny had wasnt it better to be safe than sorry selfish pleasures dissolved the way dreams did jenny knew that for certain leaving behind nothing more than an imprint on the pillowcase a hole in your heart a list of regrets so long you could wrap them around yourself like a quilt one formed from a complicated pattern love knot or dove in the window or crowsfoot soon enough jennys marriage to will avery fell apart unwound by mistrust and dishonesty one thread and one betrayal at a time for quite a while there had been nothing holding these two together but a shared history the mere fact that theyd grown up together and had been childhood sweethearts if anything they stayed together longer than they might have merely for the sake of their daughter their stella their star but children can tell when love has been lost they know when silence means peace and when its a sign of despair jenny tried not to think what her mother might say if she knew how badly their marriage had ended how selfrighteous elinor sparrow would be if she ever found out that will for whom jenny had given up so much now lived in his own apartment on the far end of marlborough street where at last he was free to do as he pleased not that he hadnt done so all along that will was unfaithful should have been evident whenever he lied white spots appeared on his fingernails and each time he was with another woman he developed what jennys mother had called quotliars coughquot a constant hacking a reminder that hed swallowed the truth whole every time will came back to jenny he swore he was a changed man but he had remained the same person hed been at the age of sixteen when jenny had first spied him from her bedroom window out on the lawn the boy who had always looked for trouble didnt have to search for it after a while it found him no matter where he was day or night it followed him home and slipped under the door and lay down beside him all the same will avery had never presented himself as anything other than the unreliable individual that he was hed never claimed to have a conscience never claimed anything at all it was jenny who had insisted she couldnt live without him jenny who forgave him who was desperate for one of his dreams one that would remind her of the reason she fell in love with him in the first place indeed if elinor sparrow found out they had broken up she certainly would not have been surprised she had correctly judged will avery to be a liar the moment she met him she knew him for what he was at first sight that was her talent after all one sentence and she knew one shrug of the shoulders one false excuse she had marched will avery right out of the house when she found him lurking in the parlor and shed never let him return not even when jenny begged her to reconsider she refused to change her opinion elinor was still referring to him as the liar on the brilliant afternoon when jenny left home it was the spring of jennys senior year of high school that feverish season when rash decisions were easily made by the time jenny sparrows classmates had been to the prom and were getting ready for graduation jenny was working in baileys ice cream parlor in cambridge supporting will while he managed to ruin his academic career with hardly any effort effort on the other hand was all jenny seemed to possess she washed dishes after a full day of work she toted laundry to the wash and dri on saturdays at eighteen she was a high school dropout and the perfect wife exhausted too busy for anything like regret after a while her life in her hometown of unity seemed like a dream the common across from the meetinghouse where the war memorials stood the linden trees the smell of the laurel so spicy just before blooming the way everything turned green all at once as though winter itself was a dream a fleeting nightmare made up of ice and heartlessness and sorrow
