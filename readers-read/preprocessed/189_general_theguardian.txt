 one four years later in the years since jim had died julie barenson had somehow found a way to start living again it hadnt happened right away the first couple of years after his death had been difficult and lonely but time had eventually worked its magic on julie changing her loss into something softer though she loved jim and knew that part of her would always love jim the pain wasnt as sharp as it had once been she could remember her tears and the total vacuum her life had become in the aftermath of his death but the searing ache of those days was behind her now when she thought of jim she remembered him with a smile thankful that hed been part of her life she was thankful for singer too jim had done the right thing by getting her the dog in a way singer had made it possible for her to go on but at this moment while lying in bed on a cool spring morning in swansboro north carolina julie wasnt thinking about what a wonderful support singer had been during the past four years instead she was mentally cursing his very existence while gasping for breath thinking i cant believe that this is the way im going to die squashed in bed by my very own dog with singer splayed across her pinning her to the mattress she imagined her lips turning blue from oxygen deprivation get up you lazy dog she wheezed youre killing me here snoring soundly singer didnt hear her and julie began squirming trying to bounce him from his slumber suffocating beneath theweight she felt as if shed been wrapped in a blanket and tossed in a lake mafia style im serious she forced out i cant breathe singer finally lifted his massive head and blinked at her groggily whats all the racket about he seemed to be asking cant you see im trying to rest here get off julie rasped out singer yawned pushing his cold nose against her cheek yeah yeah good morning she gasped now scoot with that singer snorted and found his legs further squashing various parts of her as he got up and up and up and up a moment later towering over her with just a smudge of drool on his lips he looked like something from a lowbudget horror movie good lord she thought he is huge youd think that id be used to it by now she took a deep breath and looked up at him frowning did i say you could get into bed with me she asked singer usually slept in the corner of her room at night the past two nights however hed crawled in with her or more accurately on top of her crazy dog singer lowered his head and licked her face no youre not forgiven she said pushing him away dont even bother trying to get out of this you could have killed me youre almost twice as heavy as i am you know now get off the bed singer whined like a pouting child before hopping down to the floor julie sat up ribs aching and looked at the clock thinking already she and singer stretched at the same time before she pushed aside the covers cmon she said ill let you out before i get in the shower but dont go sniffing around the neighbors garbage cans again they left a nasty message on the machine singer looked at her i know i know she said its only garbage but some people are funny that way singer left the bedroom heading toward the front door julie rolled her shoulders as she followed him her eyes closed for just a moment big mistake on the way out of the bedroom she slammed her toe against the dresser the pain shot from her toe up through her lower leg after the initial scream she began to curse combining profanity in all sorts of marvelous permutations hopping on one foot in her pink pajamas she was sure she looked like some sort of deranged energizer bunny singer merely gave her a look that seemed to imply whats the holdup you got me up remember so lets get going here ive got things to do outside she groaned cant you see im wounded here singer yawned again and julie rubbed her toe before limping after him thanks for coming to my rescue youre worthless in an emergency a moment later after singer stepped on julies sore toe on his way out the doorjulie knew hed done it on purposehe was outside instead of heading toward the garbage cans singer wandered over to the vacant wooded lots that bordered one side of her house she watched as he swung his massive head from side to side as if making sure that no one had planted any new trees or bushes during the preceding day all dogs liked to mark their territory but singer seemed to believe that somehow if he found enough places to relieve himself hed be anointed king dog in all the world at least it got him out of her hair for a while thank heaven for small favors julie thought singer had been driving her crazy for the last couple of days hed followed her everywhere refusing to let her out of his sight for even a few minutes except when she put him outside she hadnt even been able to put the dishes away without bumping into him a dozen times he was even worse at night last night hed had a growling fit for an hour which hed thoughtfully interspersed with an occasional bark and the whole thing had left her fantasizing about buying either a soundproof kennel or an elephant gun not that singers behavior had ever been well ordinary except for the peeing thing the dog had always acted as if he thought he were human he refused to eat out of a dog bowl hed never needed a leash and when julie watched television he would crawl up on the couch and stare at the screen and when she talked to himwhenever anyone talked to him for that mattersinger would stare intently his head tilted to the side as if he were following the conversation and half the time it did seem as if he understood what she was telling him no matter what she told him to do no matter how ridiculous the command singer would carry it out could you go get my purse from the bedroom singer would come trotting out with it a moment later will you turn off the bedroom light hed balance on two legs and flick it with his nose put this can of soup in the pantry okay hed carry it in his mouth and set it on the shelf sure other dogs were well trained but not like this besides singer hadnt needed training not real training anyway all shed had to do was show him something once and that was it to others it seemed downright eerie but since it made julie feel like a modernday dr dolittle she kind of liked it even if it did mean she talked to her dog in complete sentences had arguments with him and asked for his advice now and then but hey she told herself that wasnt so odd was it theyd been together since jim had died just the two of them and for the most part singer was pretty good company singer though had been acting strangely ever since she started dating again and he hadnt liked any of the guys whod shown up at the door in the last couple of months julie had expected that part since hed been a puppy singer tended to growl at men when he first met them she used to think that singer had a sixth sense that enabled him to tell the good guys from the ones she should avoid but lately shed changed her mind now she couldnt help but think that he was just a big furry version of a jealous boyfriend it was getting to be a problem she decided they were going to have to have a serious talk singer didnt want her to be alone did he no of course not it might take him a little while to get used to having someone else around but hed understand eventually hell in time hed probably even be happy for her but how she wondered was the best way to explain all this to him she halted for a moment considering the question before realizing the implications of what she was thinking explain all this to him good lord she thought im going insane julie limped to the bathroom to start getting ready for work slipping off her pajamas as she went standing over the sink she grimaced at her reflection look at me she thought im twentynine and falling apart at the seams here her ribs hurt when she breathed her big toe throbbed and the mirror she realized wasnt helping things during the day her brown hair was long and straight but after a night in bed it looked as if it had been attacked by combteasing pillow gnomes it was frazzled and puffed out under siege as jim so kindly used to put it mascara was smeared down her cheek the tip of her nose was red and her green eyes were swollen from the springtime pollen but a shower would help with those things wouldnt it well maybe not with the allergies she opened the medicine cabinet and took a claritin before glancing up again as if hoping for a sudden improvement ugh maybe she thought she wouldnt have to work so hard at discouraging bobs interest after all shed been cutting bobs hair or rather what was left of it for a year now two months ago bob had finally worked up the nerve to ask her out he wasnt exactly the bestlooking guy in the worldbalding with a round face eyes set too close together and the beginnings of a paunchbut he was single and successful and julie hadnt been on a date since jim had died she figured it would be a good way to get her feet wet in the world of dating again wrong there was a reason bob was single bob wasnt only a triple bogey in the looks department hed been so boring on their date that even people at nearby tables in the restaurant had glanced her way in pity his preferred topic of conversation on their date had been accounting hed showed no interest in anything else not her not the menu not the weather not sports not the little black dress she was wearing only accounting for three hours shed listened to bob drone on and on about itemized deductions and capital gains distributions depreciation and 401k rollovers by the end of the dinner when hed leaned over the table and confided that he knew important people at the irs julies eyes were so glazed that they could have flavored a dozen doughnuts it went without saying of course that bob had had a wonderful time hed been calling three times a week since then asking if they could get together for a second consultation hee hee hee he was persistent that was for sure annoying as hell but persistent then there was ross the second guy she dated ross the doctor ross the goodlooking guy ross the pervert one date with him was enough thank you very much and cant forget good old adam he worked for the county he said he enjoyed his work he said just a regular guy he said adam she found out worked in the sewers he didnt smell he didnt have unknown substances growing under his fingernails his hair didnt carry a greasy shine but she knew that as long as she lived shed never get used to the idea that one day he might show up at the front door looking that way had an accident at the plant dear sorry to come home like this the very thought gave her the shivers nor could she imagine handling his clothes to put them in the laundry after something like that the relationship was doomed from the start just when she was beginning to wonder whether normal people like jim even existed anymore just when she was beginning to wonder what it was about her that seemed to attract oddballs like a neon sign flashing im availablenormalcy not required richard had come strolling into the picture and miracle of miracles even after a first date last saturday he still seemed normal a consultant with j d blanchard engineering out of clevelandthe firm repairing the bridge over the intracoastal waterwayhe had made her acquaintance when he came into the salon for a haircut on their date hed opened doors for her smiled at the right moments in the conversation given the waiter her order for dinner and not so much as tried to kiss her when hed dropped her off best of all he was goodlooking in an artistic sort of way with sculpted cheekbones emerald eyes black hair and a mustache after hed dropped her off shed felt like screaming hallelujah i have seen the light singer hadnt seemed quite as impressed after shed said good night to richard singer had put on one of his im the boss around here acts hed growled until julie had opened the front door oh stop it shed said dont be so hard on him singer did as he was told but hed retreated to the bedroom where hed pouted the rest of the night if my dog was any more bizarre she thought we could team up and work for a carnival right next to the guy who eats light bulbs but then my life hasnt exactly been normal either julie turned on the faucet and stepped into the shower trying to stem the tide of memories what was the use of replaying hard times her mother she often mused had been fatally attracted to two things booze and toxic men either one without the other would have been bad but the combination had been intolerable for julie her mom went through boyfriends the way kids go through paper towels and some of them made julie feel less than comfortable once she hit adolescence the last one had actually tried to have his way with her and when julie had told her mother her mother in a drunken teary rage had blamed her for coming on to him it wasnt long before julie found herself without a home living on the street had been terrifying even for the six months or so before jim came along most everyone she met used drugs and panhandled or stole or worse scared of becoming like the haunted runaways she saw every night at the shelters and in the doorways she searched frantically for odd jobs that would keep her fed and out of sight she worked every menial job she saw offered and kept her head down when she first met jim at a diner in daytona she was nursing a cup of coffee with the last of her pocket change jim bought her breakfast and on the way out the door said hed do the same thing the following day if she returned hungry she did and when she challenged him about his motives she assumed she knew his reasons and could remember gearing up for quite the embarrassing public tirade about cradle robbers and jail time jim denied any improper interest in her and at the end of the week when he was getting ready to head for home he made her a proposal if she moved to swansboro north carolina he would help her get a fulltime job and a place to stay she remembered staring at him as though he had bugs crawling out of his ears but a month later considering she didnt have much scheduled on the old social calendar she showed up in swansboro thinking as she got off the bus what in the world am i doing in this nowhere town nonetheless she looked up jim whodespite her persistent skepticismbrought her over to the salon to meet his aunt mabel and sure enough she found herself sweeping floors for an hourly wage and living in the room upstairs from the salon at first julie was relieved by jims lack of apparent interest then curious then annoyed finally after running into jim repeatedly and dropping what seemed to her quite shameless hints she broke down and asked mabel if she thought jim found her unattractive only then did he seem to get the message they went on a date then another and the hormones were surging after a month together real love came a short time later he proposed they walked the aisle in the church where jim had been baptized and julie spent the first few years of their marriage drawing smiley faces every time she doodled by the phone what more she wondered when considering her life could anyone want a lot she soon realized a few weeks after their fourth anniversary jim had a seizure on the way home from church and was rushed to the hospital two years later the brain tumor took his life and at the age of twentyfive julie found herself starting over once more add in singers unexpected appearance and shed reached the point in her life where nothing surprised her anymore nowadays she thought it was the little things in life that mattered if the highlights in her past set the tone it was the daybyday events that now defined who she was mabel god bless her had been an angel shed helped julie get her license so she could cut hair and earn a decent if not extravagant living henry and emma two good friends of jims not only had helped her fit into town when shed first moved here but had remained close even after jim had passed away and then there was mike henrys younger brother and jims best friend growing up in the shower julie smiled mike now there was a guy who would make some woman happy one day even if he seemed a little lost sometimes a few minutes later after toweling off julie brushed her teeth and hair put on some makeup and slipped into her clothes since her car was in the shop shed have to walk to workit was about a mile up the streetand she put on a pair of comfortable shoes she called singer just as she was locking the door on her way out nearly missing what had been left for her out of the corner of her eye she spied a card wedged between the mailbox and the lid right next to the front door curious julie opened it reading it on the porch as singer burst from the woods and trotted up to her dear julie i had a wonderful time on saturday i cant stop thinking about you richard so that was the reason singer went bonkers last night see she said holding out the card so singer could see it i told you he was a nice guy singer turned away dont give me that you can admit you were wrong you know i think youre just jealous singer nuzzled against her is that it are you jealous unlike with other dogs julie didnt have to bend down to run her hand down his back he was bigger than she had been when shed entered high school dont be jealous okay be happy for me singer circled to the other side and looked up at her now cmon we have to walk because mikes still fixing the jeep at mikes name singers tail wagged
