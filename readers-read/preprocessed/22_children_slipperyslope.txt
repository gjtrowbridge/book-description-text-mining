 chapter excerpt chapter one a man of my acquaintance once wrote a poem called the road less traveled describing a journey he took through the woods along a path most travelers never used the poet found that the road less traveled was peaceful but quite lonely and he was probably a bit nervous as he went along because if anything happened on the road less traveled the other travelers would be on the road more frequently traveled and so couldnt hear him as he cried for help sure enough that poet is now dead like a dead poet this book can be said to be on the road less traveled because it begins with the three baudelaire children on a path leading through the mortmain mountains which is not a popular destination for travelers and it ends in the churning waters of the stricken stream which few travelers even go near but this book is also on the road less traveled because unlike books most people prefer which provide comforting and entertaining tales about charming people and talking animals the tale you are reading now is nothing but distressing and unnerving and the people unfortunate enough to be in the story are far more desperate and frantic than charming and i would prefer to not speak about the animals at all for that reason i can no more suggest the reading of this woeful book than i can recommend wandering around the woods by yourself because like the road less traveled this book is likely to make you feel lonely miserable and in need of help the baudelaire orphans however had no choice but to be on the road less traveled violet and klaus the two elder baudelaires were in a caravan traveling very quickly along the high mountain path neither violet who was fourteen nor klaus who had recently turned thirteen had ever thought they would find themselves on this road except perhaps with their parents on a family vacation but the baudelaire parents were nowhere to be found after a terrible fire destroyed their home although the children had reason to believe that one parent may not have died in the blaze after all and the caravan was not heading up the mortmain mountains toward a secret headquarters the siblings had heard about and were hoping to find the caravan was heading down the mortmain mountains very quickly with no way to control or stop its journey so violet and klaus felt more like fish in a stormy sea than travelers on a vacation but sunny baudelaire was in a situation that could be said to be even more desperate sunny was the youngest baudelaire still learning to speak in a way that everyone could understand so she scarcely had words for how frightened she was sunny was traveling uphill toward the headquarters in the mortmain mountains in an automobile that was working perfectly but the driver of the automobile was a man who was reason enough for being terrified some people called this man wicked some called him facinorous which is a fancy word for wicked but everyone called him count olaf unless he was wearing one of his ridiculous disguises and making people call him a false name count olaf was an actor but he had largely abandoned his theatrical career to try to steal the enormous fortune the baudelaire parents had left behind olafs schemes to get the fortune had been meanspirited and particularly complicated but nevertheless he had managed to attract a girlfriend a villainous and stylish woman named esm squalor who was sitting next to count olaf in the car cackling nastily and clutching sunny on her lap also in the car were several employees of olafs including a man with hooks instead of hands two women who liked to wear white powder all over their faces and three new comrades olaf had recently recruited at caligari carnival the baudelaire children had been at the carnival too wearing disguises of their own and had pretended to join count olaf in his treachery but the villain had seen through their ruse a phrase which here means realized who they really were and cut the knot attaching the caravan to the car leaving sunny in olafs clutches and her siblings tumbling toward their doom sunny sat in the car and felt esms long fingernails scratch her shoulders and worried about what would happen to her and what was happening to her older siblings as she heard their screams getting fainter and fainter as the car drove farther and farther away we have to stop this caravan klaus screamed hurriedly he put on his glasses as if by improving his vision he might improve the situation but even in perfect focus he could see their predicament was dire the caravan had served as a home for several performers at the carnivals house of freaks before they defected a word which here means joined count olafs band of revolting comrades and now the contents of this tiny home were rattling and crashing with each bump in the road klaus ducked to avoid a roasting pan which hugo the hunchback had used to prepare meals and which had toppled off a shelf in the commotion he lifted his feet from the floor as a set of dominoes skittered by a set that colette the contortionist had liked to play with and he squinted above him as a hammock swung violently overhead an ambidextrous person named kevin used to sleep in that hammock until he had joined olafs troupe along with hugo and colette and now it seemed like it might fall at any moment and trap the baudelaires beneath it the only comforting thing that klaus could see was his sister who was looking around the caravan with a fierce and thoughtful expression and unbuttoning the shirt the two siblings were sharing as part of their disguise
