 chapter one interesting the ophthalmologist said rolling away from cynthia barnes in his wheeled chair like a water bug skittering for cover when the lights went on in the middle of the night not exactly my favorite word in a doctors office cynthia tried to sound lighthearted the metal apparatus was cold and heavy on her face and although it wasnt literally attached she couldnt help feeling as if she were in a vise each flick of the doctors wrist better here or here here or here seemed to tighten the machines grip on her good interesting he said rolling back to her now is it clearer with the first one or he flipped something inserted something she had never been sure what he was doing or this one could i see those again she sounded tentative even to her ears which shamed her cynthia still remembered what she was like back when she was always sure about things absolutely this one the letter o bold but a little wavy around the edges as if it were underwater or this one this o was not quite as bright yet it was clearer the second one there are no right answers here cynthia an eye exam isnt a test he chuckled at his own wit the second one good now is it better with this one or another flip this one the first one definitely the first one good she felt a little glow of pride then embarrassment for caring at all she had arrived at the doctors office on a wave of apologies having skipped her annual exam for the last three years despite the friendly little postcards that arrived every spring she was awol from the dentist too and she might have passed on this eye exam if it werent for her younger sisters sly observation that cynthia was squinting more often these days you keep straining like that youre going to have one of those little dents said sylvia who had never forgiven cynthia for getting the one pair of green eyes in their generation better reading glasses than botox cynthia had almost snapped get off my damn back ive earned that dent instead she had made this appointment with dr silverstein who had moved to the northern suburbs since she saw him last satisfied dr silverstein swung the machine off her face returned her contact lenses to her along with a tissue to catch the saline tears that flowed from the corners of her eyes he was younger than she it dawned on her he must have just been starting out when she first went to him thirteen years ago she wondered how those years had treated him if his life had gone according to his expectations and plans well ive seen this before dr silverstein said smiling so broadly that his dimples showed but ive seen few cases as pronounced as this cynthia was not comforted by the smile she had known too many people whose expressions had nothing to do with what they were about to say what what im going blind i have a tumor behind one of my eyes which explains the headaches but she hadnt told dr silverstein about the headaches should she your eyes are getting better cynthia we see this sometimes in people who have worn contact lenses for a long time nearsightedness improves youve been having trouble focusing on things because your contacts are old and pocked by protein deposits not because you need a new prescription what about reading glasses not yet good ive heard that if you get reading glasses your closeup vision gets worse and worse ah yes that old wivestale it doesnt quite work that way dr silverstein picked up a model of the human eye which cynthia found disgusting she hated to visualize what lay beneath the fragile veneer of skin always had she was nauseated at the sight of flattened squirrels and cats in her eighborhood and a passing glimpse of one of those surgery shows on cable could send her into a near faint theres a muscle that controls the lens of your eye if you will it gets rigid with age his voice trailed off when he realized cynthia was staring over his shoulder refusing to make eye contact with him or his plastic model anyway no reading glasses yet just a new contact lens prescription these should be ready in a week should the nurse call you at home or at work home i havent worked in years dr silverstein blinked suddenly awkward he was one of the people who had never had a chance to say im sorry because the tragedy was almost a year in the past by the time he saw her at her annual exam cynthias life was full of such acquaintances wellmeaning types who had been left stranded by the tenuousness of their connection doctors mechanics accountants she remembered the april immediately following when warren asked the accountant how one calculated for a dependent who had not survived the calendar year did they take the full credit or did olivias death mean they had to prorate the deduction for warren and cynthia who had already asked a thousand questions they had never planned to ask questions about burials and caskets and plots and the scars left by autopsies it was just another dreary postscript the accountant had looked so stricken she had wanted to comfort him she was beyond that now
