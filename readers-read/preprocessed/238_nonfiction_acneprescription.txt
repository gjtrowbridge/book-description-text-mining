1986 was a banner year for me after many years spent undergoing rigorous medical training and testing i was about to begin my private dermatological practice i had received my medical degree from michigan state university college of human medicine followed by a oneyear internship in pediatrics at yale new haven hospital i then completed a threeyear residency at the ford medical center in my specialty dermatology and was now ready and eager to begin seeing and treating patients dermatology the diagnosis and treatment of the skin and its diseases is one of those specialties that has patients of every age from infancy to old age and every point in between it is interesting to note that in my dermatological residency we spent very little time studying the causes and treatment of acne one of the most prevalent yet difficult skin diseases to successfully treat in addition to the physical disfigurement caused by the blemishes acne can also leave deep scars on the psyche despite these facts close to two thirds of our time was spent learning how to diagnose and treat other skin diseases a full one third of the residency was spent learning how to perform dermatological surgery as a newly graduated dermatology resident with board certification i opened a solo practice in connecticut where i quickly discovered that a large portion of my patients suffered from acne i was comfortable treating my adolescent acne patients as i myself had suffered from fairly severe acne that began around the time i turned fourteen and continued to plague me throughout my early and midtwenties i could empathize with the teenagers who came seeking my help i had been there my story when i developed acne in my teens i lacked the financial means to seek professional medical advice or treatment for it i haunted the corner drugstore searching the shelves for remedies about the best i could find were products that contained active ingredients such as sulfur in a tinted base overthecounter medicated coverup creams they helped a little at first but soon lost their effectiveness by the time i reached college i finally began seeing a dermatologist i was treated with a range of things from ultraviolet radiation and oral antibiotics such as tetracycline to topical abrasive scrubs containing tiny bits of sand followed by tinted hydrocortisonebased lotions the doctor also performed what i called acne surgery he used an instrument to actually unplug the affected pores we continued these treatments for approximately six months after which i felt that there was not enough improvement to justify the time expense and discomfort following college graduation i entered the army where i had severe acne flareups during both basic and advanced training the army however did not consider acne a disease worth treating so there were no options open to me other than to endure the condition and bide my time after suffering an arm injury i spent a few months in an army hospital i finally had the opportunity to speak to a physician about my acne but was too embarrassed to bring it up this was a tertiary care hospital all around me were patients in need of acute or critical care in the bed to the right of me lay a soldier who had been hit by ak47 fire and whose arm bones had been shattered to my left was a man with both arms in casts suffering from severe burns and fractures sustained from enemy fire on his helicopter although my right arm was in a cast what i was most concerned about was my acne after i was discharged from active army duty i was once again employed although id not yet decided to enter medicine i immediately sought help from a dermatologist i went through a number of treatments none of which seemed to bring any relief leaving me depressed and discouraged vitamin a for acne relief one lucky day a friend of mine told me about dr sidney hurwitz one of the first pediatric dermatologists in the country dr hurwitz was a true innovator who kept up with the latest dermatological developments and treatments he was achieving greater results than just about anyone in dermatology at that time dr hurwitz had been a boardcertified practicing pediatrician who had decided to enter a threeyear dermatological residency program to become a dermatologist now that his specialties were both dermatology and pediatrics he limited his practice to patients no older than sixteen although i was well over that age i was determined to see him i called dr hurwitz explained my situation and asked if he would make an exception in my case much to my delight he said yes during my first office visit i was very impressed with dr hurwitz both as a man and as a physician he was brimming with incredible enthusiasm for his work and i could see that he loved taking care of his patients for the first time in more than a decade i felt a genuine sense of hope and renewed optimism after examining my face and cataloging the long list of my previous treatments he asked me an intriguing question have you tried vitamin a to treat your acne in my ongoing search for a cure i had read about vitamin a and taken large selfprescribed doses of the supplement but had not seen any effects i am referring to a new form of vitamin a that is applied topically directly to the skin he explained the university of pennsylvania has been conducting extensive research utilizing vitamin a acid and has a product in early clinical trials he then told me that johnson johnson had licensed the technology i was ready and willing to be a guinea pig and i eagerly agreed to participate in the study dr hurwitz used this new product on me in combination with other topical and oral medications and over a period of a few months my face completely cleared
