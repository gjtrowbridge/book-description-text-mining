 the smell roused cotton malone to consciousness sharp acrid with a hint of sulfur and something else sweet and sickening like death he opened his eyes he lay prone on the floor arms extended palms to the hardwood which he immediately noticed was sticky what happened he8217d attended the april gathering of the danish antiquarian booksellers society a few blocks west of his bookshop near the gaiety of tivoli he liked the monthly meetings and this one had been no exception a few drinks some friends and lots of book chatter tomorrow morning he8217d agreed to meet cassiopeia vitt her call yesterday to arrange the meeting had surprised him he8217d not heard from her since christmas when she8217d spent a few days in copenhagen he8217d been cruising back home on his bicycle enjoying the comfortable spring night when he8217d decided to check out the unusual meeting location she8217d chosen the museum of grecoroman culture8211a preparatory habit from his former profession cassiopeia rarely did anything on impulse so a little advance preparation wasn8217t a bad idea he8217d found the address which faced the frederiksholms canal and noticed a halfopen door to the pitchdark building8211a door that should normally be closed and alarmed he8217d parked his bike the least he could do was close the door and phone the police when he returned home but the last thing he remembered was grasping the doorknob he was now inside the museum in the ambient light that filtered in through two plateglass windows he saw a space decorated in typical danish style8211a sleek mixture of steel wood glass and aluminum the right side of his head throbbed and he caressed a tender knot he shook the fog from his brain and stood he8217d visited this museum once and had been unimpressed with its collection of greek and roman artifacts just one of a hundred or more private collections throughout copenhagen their subject matter as varied as the city8217s population he steadied himself against a glass display case his fingertips again came away sticky and smelly with the same nauseating odor he noticed that his shirt and trousers were damp as was his hair face and arms whatever covered the museum8217s interior coated him too he stumbled toward the front entrance and tried the door locked double dead bolt a key would be needed to open it from the inside he stared back into the interior the ceiling soared thirty feet a woodandchrome staircase led up to a second floor that dissolved into more darkness the ground floor extending out beneath he found a light switch nothing he lumbered over to a desk phone no dial tone a noise disturbed the silence clicks and whines like gears working coming from the second floor his training as a justice department agent cautioned him to keep quiet but also urged him to investigate so he silently climbed the stairs the chrome banister was damp as were each of the laminated risers fifteen steps up more glassandchrome display cases dotted the hardwood floor marble reliefs and partial bronzes on pedestals loomed like ghosts movement caught his eye twenty feet away an object rolling across the floor maybe two feet wide with rounded sides pale in color tight to the ground like one of those robotic lawn mowers he8217d once seen advertised when a display case or statue was encountered the thing stopped retreated then darted in a different direction a nozzle extended from its top and every few seconds a burst of aerosol spewed out he stepped close all movement stopped as if it sensed his presence the nozzle swung to face him a cloud of mist soaked his pants what was this the machine seemed to lose interest and scooted deeper into the darkness more odorous mist expelling along the way he stared down over the railing to the ground floor and spotted another of the contraptions parked beside a display case nothing about this seemed good he needed to leave the stench was beginning to turn his stomach the machine ceased its roaming and he heard a new sound two years ago before his divorce his retirement from the government and his abrupt move to copenhagen when he8217d lived in atlanta he8217d spent a few hundred dollars on a stainlesssteel grill the unit came with a red button that when pumped sparked a gas flame he recalled the sound the igniter made with each pump of the button the same clicking he heard right now sparks flashed the floor burst to life first sun yellow then burnt orange finally settling on pale blue as flames radiated outward consuming the hardwood flames simultaneously roared up the walls the temperature rose swiftly and he raised an arm to shield his face the ceiling joined the conflagration and in less than fifteen seconds the second floor was totally ablaze overhead sprinklers sprang to life he partially retreated down the staircase and waited for the fire to be doused but he noticed something the water simply aggravated the flames the machine that started the disaster suddenly disintegrated in a muted flash flames rolling out in all directions like waves searching for shore a fireball drifted to the ceiling and seemed to be welcomed by the spraying water steam thickened the air not with smoke but with a chemical that made his head spin he leaped down the stairs two at a time another swoosh racked the second floor followed by two more glass shattered something crashed he darted to the front of the building the other gizmo that had sat dormant sprang to life and started skirting the groundfloor display cases more aerosol spewed into the scorching air he needed to get out but the locked front door opened to the inside metal frame thick wood no way to kick it open he watched as fire eased down the staircase consuming each riser like the devil descending to greet him even the chrome was being devoured with a vengeance his breaths became labored thanks to the chemical fog and the rapidly vanishing oxygen surely someone would call the fire department but they8217d be no help to him if a spark touched his soaked clothes the blaze found the bottom of the staircase ten feet away venice italy sunday april 19 1215 am enrico vincenti stared at the accused and asked 8220any thing to say to this council8221 the man from florence seemed unconcerned by the question 8220how about you and your league cram it8221 vincenti was curious 8220you apparently think we8217re to be taken lightly8221 8220fat man i have friends8221 the florentine actually seemed proud of the fact 8220lots of them8221 he made clear 8220your friends are of no concern to us but your treachery that8217s another matter8221 the florentine had dressed for the occasion sporting an expensive zanetti suit charvet shirt prada tie and the obligatory gucci shoes vincenti realized that the ensemble cost more than most people earned in a year 8220tell you what8221 the florentine said 8220i8217ll leave and we8217ll forget all about this whatever this is and you people can go back and do whatever it is you do8221 none of the nine seated beside vincenti said a word he8217d warned them to expect arrogance the florentine had been hired to handle a chore in central asia a job the council had deemed vitally important unfortunately the florentine had modified the assignment to suit his greed luckily the deception had been discovered and countermeasures taken 8220you believe your associates will actually stand with you8221 vincenti asked 8220you8217re not that naive are you fat man they8217re the ones who told me to do it8221 he again ignored the reference to his girth 8220that8217s not what they said8221 those associates were an international crime syndicate that had many times proven useful to the council the florentine was contracted help and the council had overlooked the syndicate8217s deception in order to make a point to the liar standing before them which would make a point to the syndicate as well and it had already the fee owed had been waived and the council8217s hefty deposit returned unlike the florentine those associates understood precisely who they were dealing with 8220what do you know of us8221 vincenti asked the italian shrugged 8220a bunch of rich people who like to play8221 the bravado amused vincenti four men stood behind the florentine each armed which explained why the ingrate thought himself safe as a condition to his appearing he8217d insisted on them coming 8220seven hundred years ago8221 vincenti said 8220a council of ten oversaw venice they were men supposedly too mature to be swayed by passion or temptation charged with maintaining public safety and quelling political opposition and that8217s precisely what they did for centuries they took evidence in secret pronounced sentences and carried out executions all in the name of the venetian state8221 8220you think i care about this history lesson8221 vincenti folded his hands in his lap 8220you should care8221 8220this mausoleum is depressing it belong to you8221 true the villa lacked the charm of a house that had once been a family home but tsars emperors archdukes and crowned heads had all stayed under its roof even napoleon had occupied one of the bedrooms so he said with pride 8220it belongs to us8221 8220you need a decorator are we through here8221 8220i8217d like to finish what i was explaining8221 the italian gestured with his hands 8220get on with it i want some sleep8221 8220we too are a council of ten like the original we employ inquisitors to enforce our decisions8221 he gestured and three men stepped forward from the far side of the salon 8220like the originals our rule is absolute8221 8220you8217re not the government8221 8220no we8217re something else altogether8221 still the florentine seemed unimpressed 8220i came here in the middle of the night because i was ordered to by my associates not because i8217m impressed i brought these four to protect me so your inquisitors might find it difficult to enforce anything8221 vincenti pushed himself up from the chair 8220i think something needs to be made clear you were hired to handle a task you decided to change that assignment to suit your own purpose8221 8220unless all of you intend on leaving here in a box i8217d say we just forget about it8221 vincenti8217s patience had worn thin he genuinely disliked this part of his official duties he gestured and the four men who8217d come with the florentine grabbed the idiot a smug look evolved into one of surprise the florentine was disarmed while three of the men restrained him an inquisitor approached and with a roll of thick tape bound the accused8217s struggling arms behind his back his legs and knees together and wrapped his face sealing his mouth the three then released their grip and the florentine8217s thick frame thudded to the rug 8220this council has found you guilty of treason to our league8221 vincenti said he gestured again and a set of double doors swung open a casket of rich lacquered wood was wheeled in its lid hinged open the florentine8217s eyes went wide as he apparently realized his fate vincenti stepped close 8220five hundred years ago traitors to the state were sealed into rooms above the doge8217s palace built of wood and lead exposed to the elements8212they became known as the coffins8221 he paused and allowed his words to take hold 8220horrible places most who entered died you took our money while at the same time trying to make more for yourself8221 he shook his head 8220not to be and by the way your associates decided you were the price they would pay to keep peace with us8221 the florentine fought his restraints with a renewed vigor his protests stifled by the tape across his mouth one of the inquisitors led the four men who8217d come with the florentine from the room their job was done the other two inquisitors lifted the struggling problem and tossed him into the coffin vincenti stared down into the box and read exactly what the florentine8217s eyes were saying no question he8217d betrayed the council but he8217d only done what vincenti not those associates had ordered him to do vincenti was the one who changed the assignment and the florentine had only appeared before the council because vincenti had privately told him not to worry just a dog and pony show no problem play along it would all be resolved in an hour 8220fat man8221 vincenti asked 8220arrivederci8221 and he slammed the lid shut copenhagen malone watched as the flames descending the staircase stopped three quarters of the way down showing no signs of advancing farther he stood before one of the windows and searched for something to hurl through the plate glass the only chairs he spotted were too close to the fire the second mechanism continued to prowl the ground floor exhaling mist he was hesitant to move stripping off his clothes was an option but his hair and skin also stank with the chemical three thuds on the plateglass window startled him he whirled and a foot away a familiar face stared back cassiopeia vitt what was she doing here his eyes surely betrayed his surprise but he came straight to the point and yelled 8220i need to get out of here8221 she pointed to the door he intertwined his fingers and signaled that it was locked she motioned for him to stand back as he did sparks popped from the underside of the roaming gizmo he darted straight for the thing and kicked it over beneath he spotted wheels and mechanical works he heard a pop then another and realized what cassiopeia was doing shooting the window then he saw something he8217d not noticed before atop the museum8217s display cases lay sealed plastic bags filled with a clear liquid the window fractured no choice he risked the flames and grabbed one of the chairs he8217d earlier noticed slinging it into the damaged glass the window shattered as the chair found the street beyond the roving mechanism righted itself one of the sparks caught and blue flames began to consume the ground floor advancing in every direction including straight for him he bolted forward and leaped out the open window landing on his feet cassiopeia stood three feet away he8217d felt the change in pressure when the window shattered he knew a little about fires right now flames were being supercharged by a rush of new oxygen pressure differences were also having an effect firefighters called it flashover and those plastic bags atop the cases he knew what they contained he grabbed cassiopeia8217s hand and yanked her across the street 8220what are you doing8221 she asked 8220time for a swim8221 they leaped from the brick parapet just as a fireball surged from the museum
