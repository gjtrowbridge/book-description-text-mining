 quotcome onquot savannah whispered tugging the young mans hand she climbed a wooden fence into the backyard of a narrow twostory house quotwatch out for the rosesquot she said as his feet threatened to land in the border quotwe gotta come this way or the old bugger next door will bitch about me having friends over when no ones homequot quotyeahquot the boy said quoti get shit from my folks about that tooquot quotoh paige and lucas dont care as long as i clean up and dont have any monster parties well they might care if they found out i was bringing a guy over but if that old man sees me having friends over he starts telling people that paige and lucas are crappy guardians shit like that makes me want toquot she swallowed her next words and shrugged quottell him off or somethingquot i was less than a halfdozen paces behind but they never turned around never even peered over their shoulders sometimes that really pisses me off sure all teenagers ignore their mothers and sure savannah had a good excuse since id been dead for three years still youd think wed have a deeper connection that shed somehow hear me if only as a voice in her head that said quotdont listen to that girlquot or quotthat boys not worth the troublequot never happened though in life id been one of the most powerful women in the supernatural world an aspicio halfdemon and witch master of the black arts now i was a thirdrate ghost who couldnt even contact her own daughter my afterlife sucked savannah took the boy through the leanto dragged him away from lucass latest motorcycle restoration project and into the house the back door swung shut in my face i walked through it they shed their shoes then climbed the small set of stairs from the landing to the kitchen savannah headed straight for the fridge and started grabbing sandwich fixings i walked past them through the dining room into the living room and settled into my favorite spot a butter yellow leather armchair id done the right thing sending savannah to paige quite possibly the smartest thing id ever done of course if id been really smart savannah wouldnt have needed anyone to take her in i wouldnt have been in such a hellfire rush to escape that compound wouldnt have gotten myself killed wouldnt have endangered my little girl yes id screwed up but i was going to fix that now id promised to look after my daughter and i would just as soon as i figured out how savannah and her friend took their sandwiches into the dining room i leaned forward to peer around the corner just a quick check in case in case what eve in case she chokes on a pickle i silenced the toofamiliar inner voice and started to settle back into my chair when i noticed a third person in the dining room in a chair pulled up to the front window sat a grayhaired woman her head bent shoulders racked with silent sobs savannah brushed past the woman and took a seat on the opposite side of the table quotdid you hear ms lenke might not be back before the city finals shed better be callahan doesnt know the difference between a dead ball and a free ballquot the boy snorted quotid be surprised if that moron could tell a basketball from a football at last weeks practice quot i tuned them out and focused on the woman as i drew near i could hear her muted sobs i sighed and leaned against the dining room doorway quotlookquot i said quotwhatever happened to you im sure it was bad but you have to move on go into the light or click your heels three times or whatever get thee to the other side ghostquot the woman didnt even look up only thing worse than a stubborn spirit is a rude one id seen her here at least a dozen times since the kids had moved in and not once had she so much as acknowledged my presence never spoke never left that chair never stopped crying and i thought i had a lousy afterlife i softened my tone quotyou have to get over it youre wasting your timequot she faded and was gone really some people quotwheres that new stereo you gotquot the boy asked through a mouthful of multigrain bread quotin my roomquot savannah hesitated quotyou wanna go up and see itquot the boy jumped to his feet so fast his chair tumbled over backward savannah laughed and helped him right it then she grabbed his hand and led him to the stairs i stayed at the bottom a moment later music rocked the rafters nothing i recognized dead three years and i was already a popculture hasbeen no wait i did recognize the song quotdont fear the reaperquot but with a techno beat who the hell was this not blue oyster cult thats for sure what kind of crap oh god i was turning into my mother id avoided it all my life and now a man walked through the wall two inches taller than me a decade older broad shoulders thickening middle thinning blond hair gorgeous bright blue eyes which followed my gaze to the stairs quotand what does our daughter desperately need your help with todayquot he asked kristof nasts contribution to quotour daughterquot had been purely biological having not entered her life until just days before the end of his my choice not his after id become pregnant id skedaddled took him thirteen years and a mortal blow to the head but hed finally caught up with me he cocked his head listened to the music and pulled a face quotwell at least shes out of the boyband stage and it could be worse bryce went through heavy metal then rap then hiphop and at each phase i swore the next one couldnt be any worse but he always found somethingquot kristof stopped and waved a hand in front of my eyes quotcome on evequot he said quotsavannahs taste may be questionable but she doesnt require musical supervisionquot quotshhh can you hear anythingquot he arched his brows quotbesides a badly tuned bass guitar and vocals worthy of a castrated stray catquot quotshe has a boy up therequot another frown deeper this time quotwhat kind of boyquot quothumanquot quoti meant what sort of boy this isnt the same onequot he closed his mouth with an audible click of his teeth then launched into a voice i knew only too well one i heard in my head when he wasnt around quotall right savannah has a boy in her room shes fifteen we both know they arent up there on a study date as for exactly what theyre doing is that really any of your businessquot quotim not worried about sex kris shes a smart girl if shes readyand i dont think she isshell take precautions but what if hes ready i barely know this guy he couldquot quotforce her to do something she doesnt wantquot his laugh boomed through the foyer quotwhens the last time anyone forced you to do something against your will shes your daughter eve first guy who puts a hand where she doesnt want it will be lucky if he doesnt lose itquot quoti know butquot quotwhat if they do turn that music down do you really want to hear whats going onquot quotof course not thats why im staying down here im just making surequot quotyou cant make sure of anything youre dead that boy could pull a gun on her and theres not a damn thing you could do about itquot quotim working on thatquot he sighed quotyouve been working on it for three years and youre no better off than when you startedquot he hesitated then plowed forward quotyou need to step back from it for a while take a breakquot quotand do whatquot quotwell funny you should ask thats what i wanted to talk to you about i happen to have a temp job lined up for you full of adventure mystery maybe even a little danger quot quotjust a littlequot he grinned quotdepends on how you play itquot i paused then glanced up the stairs quotwell talk about it laterquot kristof threw up his hands and disappeared into the wall i plunked down onto the step savannah and i had a special bond he couldnt possibly understand i only wish that were true kris had singleparented both his sons after his wife had left them while his youngest was still in diapers soon after wed met his secretary had paged him because sean had been hit in the head during a baseball game for barely more than a bump hed blown off an important dinner meeting to catch the next plane home and thats when my opinion of him had begun the slow but steady shift that led to savannah it had ended there though once id realized i was a black witch carrying the bastard child of a cabal sorcerer heir i hadnt been dumb enough to stick around and see what his family thought as for what kristof thought of me taking our daughter away well id spent twelve years trying not to think about that i knew id made a mistake an error in judgment overshadowed only by that final error in judgment id made in the compound yet for twelve years id been able to coast on my guilt trip telling myself maybe kristof hadnt really cared that id taken savannah bullshit of course but not having him there to say otherwise had made it easier until six months after my death when id seen him fight for custody of her and die trying to protect her upstairs the music ended savannah popped in another cd or switched mp3s or whatever music came on these days the next song began something slow and definitely soft enough for me to hear giggles and murmurs damn it kris was right following my daughter to the mall was one thing listening to her make out with a boy was wrong and creepy but now i was stuck here if kristof found out id left right after him hed know id seen his point and i wasnt ready to admit that maybe a sharp oath burst from the living room i took a cautious step toward the corner in life i would have strode over there defensive spell at the ready but here well here things were different kristof stepped from behind the sofa picking what looked like cobwebs from his rumpled shirt the back of his hair stuck straight up as if someone had run a staticcharged hand through it his tie was shredded he gave a fierce wetdog shake when he finished he was immaculate again except for his tie which was tucked into his shirt i plucked it out and straightened it quotlet me guessquot i said quotwrong turn againquot he gave a helpless shrug quotyou know how i am with spellsquot quotuhhuhquot i glanced back at the stairs a sigh floated down i turned back to kris quotwant a liftquot quotpleasequot 2 transportation is my afterlife specialtymy quest to help savannah meant i spent a lot of time tracking down sources in other areas of ghost activity im not so good though i didnt think the fates needed to send me through that damned orientation course three times my afterlife world was a version of earth with some weird subdimensions that we really tried to avoid everyone here was a supernatural but not every supernatural was here when id died my first thought on waking had been quotgreat now i finally find out what comes nextquot well actually that had been my second thought after quothmmm i thought it would have been hotterquot yes id escaped the fiery hell my mother and many others had prophesied for me but in dying i hadnt found out what comes next only what came next for me was there fire and brimstone somewhere else were there halos and heavenly harps i have no idea i only know that where i am is better than where i expected to be so im not complaining i dropped kristof off on the courthouse steps yes we have courts here the fates take care of all major disciplinary issues but they let us handle disputes between ghosts hence the courts where kristof worked not that hed practiced law in real life the day hed passed the bar exam hed gone into business with his family but here he was playing lawyer in the afterlife even kris admitted this wasnt his first choice for a new career but until they started a ghost world nhl franchise he was stuck with it speaking of jobs kristof was right i needed a break id known that for a while now but couldnt bring myself to admit it i knew kriss quottemp jobquot wouldnt be the kind of employment the fates would approve of but that was more incentive than obstacle that thought had no sooner left my mind than a bluish fog blew in and swirled around my leg quothey i was justquot the fog sucked me into the ground the searchers deposited me in the fates throne room a white marble cavern with moving mosaics on the walls the fates are the guardians of the supernatural layers of the ghost world and just about the only time they call us in is when weve screwed up so as the floor began to turn i braced myself when it didnt turn fast enough i twisted around to face the fates myself a pretty girl threaded yarn onto a spinning wheel she looked no more than five or six years old with bright violet eyes that matched her dress quotokayquot i said quotwhat did i doquot the girl smiled quotisnt the question what did i do nowquot i sighed and in less time than it takes to blink the girl morphed into a middleaged version of herself with long graying dark hair and lightbrown skin showing the first wrinkles and roughness of time quotwe have a problem evequot quotlook i promised i wouldnt use the codes for excessive unauthorized travel i never saidquot quotthis isnt about unauthorized travelquot i thought for a moment quotvisiting adena milan for spellswapping hey that was an honest mistake no one told me she was on the blacklistquot the middleaged fate shook her head quotadmittedly there might be some amusement to be had in making you recite the whole list of your infractions but im afraid we dont have that much time eighteen months ago you made a deal with us if we returned paige and lucas to the living world youd owe us a favorquot quotoh thatquot damn when they hadnt mentioned it again id hoped theyd forgotten like thats going to happen the fates can remember what noah ate for breakfast on the morning of the flood
