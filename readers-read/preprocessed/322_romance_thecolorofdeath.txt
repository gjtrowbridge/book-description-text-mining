 chapter one sanibel florida november lee mandel spent a lot of time looking over his shoulder it came with the job but as he stretched contentedly in the february sun he wasnt thinking about watching his back he was smiling at the server who had the lithe body and optimism only people under thirty could manage hey you sure youve got the best shrimp on sanibel island lee teased you bet your ass sir lee laughed and waved off the server ill have the usual and coffee as fast as your big feet can manage oh and bring a couple extra togo bags okay the young man grinned reached behind his back and pulled out two white paper bags with the caf233s soup or shrimp logo printed in bright red down the side these do he dropped them in front of lee i grabbed them as soon as i saw you coming up the stairs uneasiness snaked through lee he was becoming predictable in his business that was not only stupid it was dangerous but he hadnt seen anyone following him when he drove over the bridges from the mainland to sanibel island besides once the contents of the courier packet were transferred to a wrinkled takeout bag no one would suspect what lee knew for a fact the gems were worth a million minimum wholesale in the future hed use something even less noticeable maybe a brown paper bag like the winos usually the couriers who were carrying unique goods didnt have to worry as much as the guys carrying watches and engagement rings usually but not always for the last few years there had been rumors of a new gang working one that targeted only the very highest end of portable and valuable goods the good news was that the gang wasnt as rough as the south americans the new boys were slick and quiet the server and his tight butt disappeared back into the dark smoky caf233 leaving lee alone to enjoy the winter sun he shifted his chair so that his back was to the wall of the building and wondered what his sister kate was doing now that shed finished cutting and polishing the seven sins probably she was getting ready to hit the gem show circuit again and see if she could find some rough that would repay her time and effort to cut it maybe if mom and dad let up on the grandchild subject shed slow down and find a good man as it is theyre driving her nuts as surely as they drove me guilt whispered through him he should tell his parents he really should especially now that hed found the man he wanted to spend his life with he just didnt want the crap that would come after he came out of the closet the tears and the wheredidwegowrong questions his parents hadnt gone wrong he just wasnt the son theyd expected end of sad story conversation floated around lee some of it came from the openair groundlevel parking lot directly under him nearly everything on sanibel island was built on stilts when the hurricanes came most of the mess just washed through underneath the buildings leaving the higher living quarters more or less intact but i want to see the treasure the young girls voice was high stubborn and all too clear as she emerged from a car out in the sunstruck parking lot that tourists invariably chose lee smiled slightly at the idea of sizzling upholstery and steering wheels too hot to hold and he wondered if the snowbirds were afraid of the shadows between the pillars holding up the small shopping center we saw the atocha stuff last year big deal the parental voice was frayed and impatient all they want to do in that socalled museum is sell overpriced pieces of eight to the next sucker coming through the door i dont care i want to see the gold coins and emeralds lee tuned out the girls whine even as he wondered what she would say if she saw the seven extraordinary sapphires that were locked in the trunk of his car most of the time he didnt know what he was carrying in the anonymous packets he took from point a to point b for various courier companies including the one his family owned he enjoyed the freedom of being freelance on this job he just happened to be the son of the companys owner and the brother of the cutter so he knew what the seven sins were and how much they were worth kate had been so excited about being commissioned to cut the extra fine quality sapphire rough that shed called him and described the stones to him the way hed describe a lover hed visited her twice in arizona and been amazed at the progress from shapeless dull bluish stone to exquisitely faceted gems that burned with an extraordinary blue color hed enjoyed watching kates excitement for once it had seemed like she was years younger than he was instead of eight years older not that he blamed her for being thrilled it was a real coup for a relatively young cutter to score a highend job like the rough from arthur mccloud one of the foremost collectors of gemstones in the world shed even asked that lee courier the rough to her and then courier the cut and polished seven sins back to mccloud keeping it in the family as it were squinting against the sun lee stared at the modest watch strapped to his left wrist quarter of eleven plenty of time from the caf233 it was maybe fifteen minutes over a small bridge connecting sanibel and captiva islands with luck hed have an hour after he dropped off the stones on captiva to go shelling on the falling tide and still make his flight out of fort myers to los angeles
