 one as serious as a heart attack maybe those were ken kramers last words like a final explosion of panic in his mind as he stopped breathing and dropped into the abyss he was out of line in every way there was and he knew it he was where he shouldnt have been with someone he shouldnt have been with carrying something he should have kept in a safer place but he was getting away with it he was playing and winning he was on top of his game he was probably smiling until the sudden thump deep inside his chest betrayed him then everything turned around success became instant catastrophe he had no time to put anything right nobody knows what a fatal heart attack feels like there are no survivors to tell us medics talk about necrosis and clots and oxygen starvation and occluded blood vessels they predict rapid useless cardiac fluttering or else nothing at all they use words like infarction and fibrillation but those terms mean nothing to us you just drop dead is what they should say ken kramer certainly did he just dropped dead and he took his secrets with him and the trouble he left behind nearly killed me too i was alone in a borrowed office there was a clock on the wall it had no second hand just an hour hand and a minute hand it was electric it didnt tick it was completely silent like the room i was watching the minute hand intently it wasnt moving i waited it moved it jumped ahead six degrees its motion was mechanical and damped and precise it bounced once and quivered a little and came to rest a minute one down one to go sixty more seconds i kept on watching the clock stayed still for a long long time then the hand jumped again another six degrees another minute straightup midnight and 1989 was 1990 i pushed my chair back and stood up behind the desk the phone rang i figured it was someone calling to wish me a happy new year but it wasnt it was a civilian cop calling because he had a dead soldier in a motel thirty miles offpost quoti need the military police duty officerquot he said i sat down again behind the desk quotyou got himquot i said quotweve got one of yours deadquot quotone of minequot quota soldierquot he said quotwherequot quotmotel in townquot quotdead howquot i asked quotheart attack most likelyquot the guy said i paused turned the page on the armyissue calendar on the desk from december 31st to january 1st quotnothing suspiciousquot i said quotdont see anythingquot quotyou seen heart attacks beforequot quotlots of themquot quotokquot i said quotcall post headquartersquot i gave him the number quothappy new yearquot i said quotyou dont need to come outquot he said quotnoquot i said i put the phone down i didnt need to go out the army is a big institution a little bigger than detroit a little smaller than dallas and just as unsentimental as either place current active strength is 930000 men and women and they are as representative of the general american population as you can get death rate in america is around 865 people per 100000 population per year and in the absence of sustained combat soldiers dont die any faster or slower than regular people on the whole they are younger and fitter than the population at large but they smoke more and drink more and eat worse and stress harder and do all kinds of dangerous things in training so their life expectancy comes out about average soldiers die at the same speed as everyone else do the math with the death rate versus current strength and you have twentytwo dead soldiers every single day of every single year accidents suicides heart disease cancer stroke lung disease liver failure kidney failure like dead citizens in detroit or dallas so i didnt need to go out im a cop not a mortician the clock moved the hand jumped and bounced and settled three minutes past midnight the phone rang again it was someone calling to wish me a happy new year it was the sergeant in the office outside of mine quothappy new yearquot she said to me quotyou tooquot i said quotyou couldnt stand up and put your head in the doorquot quotyou couldnt put yours out the doorquot quoti was on the phonequot quotwho was itquot quotnobodyquot i said quotjust some grunt didnt make it to the new decadequot quotyou want coffeequot quotsurequot i said quotwhy notquot i put the phone down again at that point i had been in more than six years and army coffee was one of the things that made me happy to stay in it was the best in the world no question so were the sergeants this one was a mountain woman from north georgia i had known her two days she lived offpost in a trailer park somewhere in the north carolina badlands she had a baby son she had told me all about him i had heard nothing about a husband she was all bone and sinew and she was as hard as woodpecker lips but she liked me i could tell because she brought me coffee they dont like you they dont bring you coffee they knife you in the back instead my door opened and she came in carrying two mugs one for her and one for me quothappy new yearquot i said to her she put the coffee down on my desk both mugs quotwill it bequot she said quotdont see why notquot i said quotthe berlin wall is halfway down they showed it on the television they were having a big party over therequot quotim glad someone was somewherequot quotlots of people big crowds all singing and dancingquot quoti didnt see the newsquot quotthis all was six hours ago the time differencequot quottheyre probably still at itquot quotthey had sledgehammersquot quottheyre allowed their half is a free city we spent fortyfive years keeping it that wayquot quotpretty soon we wont have an enemy anymorequot i tried the coffee hot black the best in the world quotwe wonquot i said quotisnt that supposed to be a good thingquot quotnot if you depend on uncle sams paycheckquot she was dressed like me in standard woodland camouflage battledress uniform her sleeves were neatly rolled her mp brassard was exactly horizontal i figured she had it safetypinned in back where nobody could see her boots were gleaming quotyou got any desert camosquot i asked her quotnever been to the desertquot she said quotthey changed the pattern they put big brown splotches on it five years research infantry guys are calling it chocolate chip its not a good pattern theyll have to change it back but itll take them another five years to figure that outquot quotsoquot quotif it takes them five years to revise a camo pattern your kid will be through college before they figure out force reduction so dont worry about itquot quotokquot she said not believing me quotyou think hes good for collegequot quoti never met himquot she said nothing quotthe army hates changequot i said quotand well always have enemiesquot she said nothing my phone rang again she leaned forward and answered it for me listened for about eleven seconds and handed me the receiver quotcolonel garber sirquot she said quothes in dcquot she took her mug and left the room colonel garber was ultimately my boss and although he was a pleasant human being it was unlikely he was calling eight minutes into new years day simply to be social that wasnt his style some brass does that stuff they come over all cheery on the big holidays like theyre really just one of the boys but leon garber wouldnt have dreamed of trying that with anyone and least of all with me even if he had known i was going to be there quotreacher herequot i said there was a long pause quoti thought you were in panamaquot leon garber said quoti got ordersquot i said quotfrom panama to fort bird whyquot quotnot my place to askquot quotwhen was thisquot quottwo days agoquot quotthats a kick in the teethquot he said quotisnt itquot quotis itquot quotpanama was probably more excitingquot quotit was okquot i said quotand they got you working duty officer on new years eve alreadyquot quoti volunteeredquot i said quotim trying to make people like mequot quotthats a hopeless taskquot he said quota sergeant just brought me coffeequot there was another pause quotsomeone just call you about a dead soldier in a motelquot he asked quoteight minutes agoquot i said quoti shuffled it off to headquartersquot quotand they shuffled it off to someone else and i just got pulled out of a party to hear all about itquot quotwhyquot quotbecause the dead soldier in question is a twostar generalquot the phone went quiet quoti didnt think to askquot i said the phone stayed quiet quotgenerals are mortalquot i said quotsame as anyone elsequot no reply quotthere was nothing suspiciousquot i said quothe croaked is all heart attack probably had gout i didnt see a reason to get excitedquot quotits a question of dignityquot garber said quotwe cant leave a twostar lying around bellyup in public without reacting we need a presencequot quotand that would be mequot quotid prefer someone else but youre probably the highestranking sober mp in the world tonight so yes it would be youquot quotitll take me an hour to get therequot quothes not going anywhere hes dead and they havent found a sober medical examiner yetquot quotokquot i said quotbe respectfulquot garber said quotokquot i said again quotand be polite offpost were in their hands its a civilian jurisdictionquot quotim familiar with civilians i met one oncequot quotbut control the situationquot he said quotyou know if it needs controllingquot quothe probably died in bedquot i said quotlike people doquot quotcall mequot he said quotif you need toquot quotwas it a good partyquot quotexcellent my daughter is visitingquot he clicked off and i called the civilian dispatcher back and got the name and the address of the motel then i left my coffee on my desk and told my sergeant what was up and headed back to my quarters to change i figured a presence required class a greens not woodlandpattern bdus i took a humvee from the mp motor pool and was logged out through the main gate i found the motel inside fifty minutes it was thirty miles due north of fort bird through dark undistinguished north carolina countryside that was equal parts strip malls and scrubby forest and what i figured were dormant sweet potato fields it was all new to me i had never served there before the roads were very quiet everyone was still inside partying i hoped i would be back at bird before they all came out and started driving home although i really liked the humvees chances headon against a civilian ride the motel was part of a knot of low commercial structures clustered in the darkness near a big highway interchange there was a truck stop as a centerpiece it had a greasy spoon that was open on the holidays and a gas station big enough to take eighteenwheelers there was a noname cinderblock lounge bar with lots of neon and no windows it had an exotic dancers sign lit up in pink and a parking lot the size of a football field there were diesel spills and rainbow puddles all over it i could hear loud music coming out of the bar there were cars parked threedeep all around it the whole area was glowing sulfurous yellow from the streetlights the night air was cold and full of fog the motel itself was directly across the street from the gas station it was a rundown swaybacked affair about twenty rooms long it had a lot of peeling paint it looked empty there was an office at the lefthand end with a token vehicle porch and a buzzing coke machine first question why would a twostar general use a place like this i was pretty sure there wouldnt have been a dod inquiry if he had checked into a holiday inn there were two town police cruisers parked at careless angles outside the motels lastbutone room there was a small plain sedan sandwiched between them it was cold and misted over it was a basemodel ford red four cylinder it had skinny tires and plastic hubcaps a rental for sure i put the humvee next to the righthand police cruiser and slid out into the chill i heard the music from across the street louder the lastbutone rooms lights were off and its door was open i figured the cops were trying to keep the interior temperature low trying to stop the old guy from getting too ripe i was anxious to take a look at him i was pretty sure i had never seen a dead general before three cops stayed in their cars and one got out to meet me he was wearing tan uniform pants and a short leather jacket zipped to his chin no hat the jacket had badges pinned to it that told me his name was stockton and his rank was deputy chief he was gray about fifty he was medium height and a little soft and heavy but the way he was reading the badges on my coat told me he was probably a veteran like a lot of cops are quotmajorquot he said as a greeting i nodded a veteran for sure a major gets a little goldcolored oak leaf on the epaulette one inch across one on each side this guy was looking upward and sideways at mine which wasnt the clearest angle of view but he knew what they were so he was familiar with rank designations and i recognized his voice he was the guy who had called me at five seconds past midnight quotim rick stocktonquot he said quotdeputy chiefquot he was calm he had seen heart attacks before quotim jack reacher mp duty officer tonightquot he recognized my voice in turn smiled quotyou decided to come outquot he said quotafter allquot quotyou didnt tell me the doa was a twostarquot quotwell he isquot quotive never seen a dead generalquot i said quotnot many people havequot he said and the way he said it made me think he had been an enlisted man quotarmyquot i asked quotmarine corpsquot he said quotfirst sergeantquot quotmy old man was a marinequot i said i always make that point talking to marines it gives me some kind of genetic legitimacy stops them from thinking of me as a pure army dogface but i keep it vague i dont tell them my old man had made captain enlisted men and officers dont automatically see eye to eye
