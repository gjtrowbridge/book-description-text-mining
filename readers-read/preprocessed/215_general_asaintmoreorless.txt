 not another procession this is the third in a month8221 8220i love processions i wish they had one every day8221 8220this one is special why else would everybody have to close their shops lord knows how much business we will lose8221 8220but what is it about8221 8220it is about penance the archbishop ordered it but i will tell you who is really behind it that girl from reims8221 8220the one who has been healing the sick and doing all kinds of miracles8221 8220that8217s the one8221 8220look there is the archbishop walking behind the statue of the virgin8221 8220he does not seem very steady on his feet8221 8220and there are all those other priests and monks i have never seen so many in one place8221 8220but where is she the girl8221 8220i see her now there after all those choir boys singing their hymns there she is walking by herself all in white8221 8220she looks like a bride8221 8220pray for us blessed nicole give us your blessing8221 8220she is not looking at us she is just looking up at the sky8221 8220what did you say the girl8217s name was again nicole8221 8220yes nicole tavernier the girl from reims8221 a mysterious girl whom no one knew had been given a solemn procession in her honor with all of paris at her feet how had she come to this moment she had appeared in the city only a few weeks before in the spring of 1594 father pacifique de souzy had just finished hearing confessions at the capuchin church on the rue sainthonor233 when the sacristan approached him he looked puzzled 8220father8221 he said 8220there is a young woman who insists on seeing you she says she has come with a very special mission8221 8220what sort of mission8221 asked the priest 8220i don8217t know father i am not sure what to make of her she is very earnest and sure of herself and she has a kind of82218212he groped for the right word82128220a kind of authority8221 before the priest could ask any further questions a small slim girl appeared from behind the sacristan she wore a threadbare traveling cloak with a large wooden cross hanging around her neck her shoes were scuffed her hair disordered her face was flushed her eyes were fixed on the priest she stared for a few moments at his tonsured head his narrow face with the small pointed beard 8220yes8221 she said 8220it is you father you look exactly as you did in my vision8221 8220your vision8221 8220two weeks ago during evening prayer my mind stood still i saw your image and a voice told me that you would become my spiritual director here i am i ask your help father8221 de souzy was baffled 8220help you how and to do what8221 he asked 8220help me to save the true faith and to bring all sinners to repentance8221 de souzy knew well that the religious upheavals of the time produced a great many selfappointed saviors he felt skeptical about this young girl and yet there was something about her that drew him 8220i am extremely busy and i cannot give you any special attention but of course like everyone else you are welcome to confess here whenever you feel the need8221 as father de souzy turned away the girl said firmly 8220you are wrong to refuse me father god has given me rare powers and i believe you will yet recognize them8221 to de souzy the words sounded almost like a threat but he put the incident out of his mind he was surprised the next day to see the girl again standing on the church steps surrounded by a small crowd she was speaking to them passionately 8220you have suffered great misery8221 she was saying 8220you have seen your wives and children cry with hunger and writhe in pain you have seen death everywhere war is destroying the country why is this happening it is god8217s punishment for your sins and iniquities you must confess and repent you must surrender your hearts and souls to the lord you must win over the heretics and prepare the path toward peace8221 de souzy was irritated not that he disagreed with what she said pacifique de souzy had been a firebrand in his youth but lately his attitude had begun to match his given name his own sermons while full of the necessary condemnation of the protestant heretics always appealed for reconciliation and peace to hear a woman preach however and in front of his church was offensive to his astonishment he noticed that the people surrounding her were rapt by her words they looked at her with a radiance that seemed to mirror her own some even knelt de souzy went on about his usual church business but the next day he was amazed to see the girl in the same place preaching to an even larger crowd her words were much as they had been the day before but de souzy now became aware that she was supplementing her message with biblical quotations when at length she finished he approached her and asked her to follow him into the church she did so matteroffactly as if she had expected the invitation 8220what is your name8221 he asked 8220and where do you come from8221 8220my name is nicole tavernier and i come from reims8221 8220how old are you8221 8220i am nineteen8221 he recognized in her drawling speech with its softly elongated words the accent typical of that city 8220i have been traveling from town to town bringing his message to all who were willing to hear me8221 8220and what gives you the right to do that8221 8220i know in my heart that god wants me to do this a voice tells me that it is so the same voice that sent me to you father8221 de souzy shook his head 8220i noticed that you recite passages from scripture when you talk to people do you know what the words mean8221 8220i do8221 de souzy decided to test her 8220i will read you a passage and you will try to tell me what it signifies8221 de souzy opened a bible on his desk and leafed through it for a few moments then he read from the song of songs 8220 8216let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love is better than wine8217 what does that mean to you8221 8220it means god8217s love for his church it also means that our love of jesus is better than any earthly love8221 it was a good enough answer but de souzy asked 8220did someone a priest say those things and did you then commit them to memory8221 8220i have heard sermons from many priests but my interpretations came to me from the holy spirit8221 de souzy was still doubtful 8220what does scripture say about the trinity8221 he asked 8220it says many things8221 8220all right what does saint john say8221 8220john says that there are three who in a common one are one in stateliness and therefore in power and will8221 there was no hesitation as nicole answered 8220this means8221 she continued but father de souzy held up his hand he decided to try something trickier 8220what did jesus say when he was taken to the temple how old was he how long did he stay8221 nicole smiled 8220he didn8217t say anything the first time he was forty days old that was the custom to take children to the temple forty days after their birth when he was twelve8221 and she emphasized the number 8220he was found in the temple after three days when mary and joseph told him they were worried82218212she paused as she easily and correctly quoted scripture82128220 8216son why hath thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing8217 jesus said82218212nicole continued with a slight nod to the priest to signal that the rest of his answer was coming82128220 8216how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my father8217s business8217 8221 she was looking at father de souzy and yet looking inward as well de souzy was no scholar but he realized that this young uneducated girl had given very learned answers he suddenly felt out of his depth and decided to temporize 8220i will consider your request8221 he said 8220thank you father but i hope that you will not take too long to consider there is much to be done8221 de souzy was taken aback by such arrogance but above all he was puzzled he felt that he needed more information about this odd creature and some sound advice about how to treat her for that he turned to the jesuits although they were widely distrusted even their enemies agreed that they were the best informed people in paris he sought out father pierre coton who had a reputation for shrewdness and good sense coton was a tall lean man with a shock of brown hair that was prematurely turning gray lending him a paternal air he gave anyone he spoke to the feeling of being at the center of his attention and he was unfailingly gentle after hearing father de souzy8217s request for information about one nicole tavernier coton contracted his brow as if to retrieve an invisible dossier from his memory twice he repeated the name and then said 8220nothing comes to my mind but i will try to find out what i can8221 when de souzy returned a few days later coton was ready with his report glancing at a sheet of paper in front of him he said 8220nicole tavernier is a young woman from reims nothing is known about her family she has been roaming from town to town affecting the role of a wandering preacher she has attended sick people and there have been rumors of miraculous healings she seems devoted to helping the poor and she gives them food when she can one story has it that some mysterious messenger gave her a loaf of bread that multiplied in her hands so that she was able to distribute bread continually she lodges at the hospital of saintecatherine8221 the nuns at this establishment were in charge of shrouding and burying corpses found in the street or in the river the place also gave shelter for a short time to women looking for work 8220she wants me to help her and to be her spiritual director what should i do8221 8220god knows we have seen many visionaries and healers and wonder workers8221 said coton 8220some of them are pretenders and hysterics and we must always be on guard against such persons on the other hand they must not be lightly dismissed some may be genuine and they may help fortify the faith which is why the holy league is always eager to take them up8221 8220ah yes the league8221 said de souzy sounding apprehensive the holy league was a powerful combination of catholic nobles and wealthy bourgeois who had banded together to fight the huguenots as the protestants were called in france they raised armies subsidized preachers to denounce the heretics and bitterly attacked fellow catholics who seemed insufficiently enthusiastic on behalf of the true faith it was now nearly eighty years since the german monk martin luther had posted his theses on the church door of wittenberg theses that attacked the corruption of the roman catholic church its greedy hierarchy its practice of selling indulgences that sup posedly shortened the time sinners would have to spend in pur gatory in the intervening decades protestantism as it came to be known spread everywhere in various forms bitter wars between catholics and protestants followed interrupted by peace treaties and short periods of uneasy calm only to resume again christendom had once been united more or less under the vast dome of the catholic church but that dome was now broken and every part of europe claimed its own fragment of it catholic spain under the lugubrious philip ii was in conflict with protestant england under the allegedly virginal elizabeth most german princes had followed martin luther into the protestant camp switzerland had become the protestant fortress of john calvin france was still largely catholic but the church was increasingly alarmed by the steady growth of the protestant forces coton was pained by the continuous bloodshed among christians he was a moderate who had protestant friends and did not share the holy league8217s zealotry but it was his principle to be on good terms with all factions 8220the league must be reckoned with8221 he told father de souzy 8220they are bound to hear about this girl they may try to use her to stir up fervor among the faithful who may be tiring of this endless war my advice to you is to move first and arrange for this nicole tavernier to meet some of the leaders of the league and especially their pious ladies it would be interesting to see what they make of her8221 thinking aloud coton pronounced several names but dismissed each until he finally said 8220the acaries yes i believe they are the right family for this8221 pierre acarie was one of the leaders of the holy league distinguished rich and active moreover his wife barbe was celebrated everywhere for her good works her piety and her shrewdness 8220i even know some priests who have gone to barbe acarie for advice8221 said coton de souzy nodded 8220i know her yes she has sometimes attended my church8221 8220good8221 said coton 8220i suggest that you arrange for the acaries to meet the girl and keep in mind that madame acarie8217s opinion will count as much as her husband8217s if not more8221 de souzy wanted to know if father coton would be present if and when the meeting took place 8220i would rather stay in the background for now8221 replied coton that afternoon coton went to the golden racket an establishment on the left bank where he regularly played tennis a game highly popular among gentlemen of the time he faced his usual opponent dr ren233 monnet having tied his cassock around his waist so as not to be hampered in his movements the priest beat the physician handily after the match they talked over a cooling drink they had met at the golden racket some years before and had become friends they had several things in common including a jesuit education and an abrupt change in their careers father coton had started out as a lawyer but had become increasingly disgusted with what struck him as the inhumane pettifoggery of the law he realized that he had been drawn to the church all along and he entered a jesuit seminary it had been the opposite with ren233 monnet his devout parents had wanted him to be a priest and he persuaded himself that he had a calling he too had entered a jesuit seminary at a much younger age than coton and he proved to be an excellent student but he discovered that he was not cut out for the religious life ren233 monnet developed too warm a feeling toward the gardener8217s voluptuous daughter and an unusually strict prefect abruptly ended his clerical career he decided to take up the study of medicine turning from the care of souls to the care of the body the dividing line between the two he thought might not be all that clear he always remembered something written by the great fran231ois rabelais who was a physician as well as a priest and believed that body and soul virtues and vices appetites and dreams are all mingled together in god8217s human creatures as rabelais8217s character pantagruel said 8220everything we are and that we have is made up of three things the soul the body and our property8221 monnet became a wellrespected physician in paris but was always ready to discuss religion 8220i have great difficulty with this business of celibacy8221 he told father coton when he described why he had left the seminary 8220priests commit themselves to chastity because the church demands it and that one could argue is a form of duress moral philosophers tell us that no oath taken under duress is binding8221 8220i am afraid that is what people call a jesuitical argument8221 said coton but he was tolerant of monnet8217s foibles and his skepticism he liked him and trusted him now he said 8220i believe you are friendly with the acaries8221 8220yes i have been their doctor for several years and i can say that i am also their friend8221 8220i arranged for them to meet a young woman who has begun to make a stir in paris8221 he summarized briefly what little he knew about nicole tavernier 8220father de souzy will bring her i myself do not yet want to be identified with her but as a friend of the house you could easily be present at this meeting if you agree perhaps you could let me know later what the girl is like and what sort of impression she made on the acaries or on you for that matter8221 ren233 monnet was a wiry man in his middle years with reddish bristly hair his left eyelid drooped slightly which gave him a deceptively sleepy appearance it was always a little surprising when he flashed out with a sharp look as he did now 8220why are you interested in her8221 8220my instinct tells me that eventually a great many people may be interested in her8221 dr monnet promised that he would try to attend the meeting and to let coton know how it went he pulled out a timepiece an extraordinary watch made of silver and shaped like a death8217shead 8220do you have time for another game8221 monnet asked 8220i do but put away that awful watch of yours in these times we hardly need a reminder of death
