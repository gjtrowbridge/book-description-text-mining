 1nbspnbspthe perricone promise the world is so fast that there are days when the person who says it can8217t be done is interrupted by the person who is doing it 8212anonymous the universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper 8212eden phillpotts what if i were to tell you that we are on the threshold of a revolution that can reverse the signs of aging and that with this book in hand by following just three simple steps you can start reaping these benefits today when i wrote the wrinkle cure and the perricone prescription i introduced the inflammationaging connection8212the concept that inflammation at the cellular level is the single most powerful cause of the signs of aging that8217s not to mention the correlation between inflammation and such chronic diseases as arthritis diabetes alzheimer8217s cancer and strokes the extensive research and the resulting solutions i introduced still hold true today and thousands of people have reported how much better they look and feel after following my program i could have discontinued my research there but i knew there was more to learn i knew that if inflammation was at the root of aging something deeper must be able to mediate that inflammation that 8220something deeper8221 turns out to be the biggest breakthrough in antiaging medicine in years proteinlike substances in our bodies called peptides and neuropeptides peptides are compounds consisting of two or more amino acids the building blocks of proteins chained together by what is called a peptide bond neuropeptides are peptides released by neurons brain cells as intercellular messengers some neuropeptides function as neurotransmitters and others function as hormones peptides and neuropeptides like many substances in our bodies think cholesterol can work both for and against us the good news is that by following the program in the perricone promise you can dramatically increase the positive effects of antiinflammatory peptides and neuropeptides and greatly decrease their negative influences as a result you will experience dramatic changes not only in the way you look but also in the way you feel in just twentyeight days you can erase what seems like ten years from your face and body with the perricone promise you8217ll learn to help reverse the aging process and add many more youthful years to your life look better feel better in three easy steps as a dermatologist my primary interest and concern is how my patients look is your skin clear and healthy is your skin radiant and glowing or is it dull and

the skin when i began my research into peptides and neuropeptides my goal was to help solve my patients8217 skin problems i wanted to find ways to help them look healthier and younger how exciting then to discover that my research had much greater benefit than i ever imagined it turns out that boosting the positive powers of peptides and neuropeptides will not only help you look healthier and younger but actually help you maintain the health of every system and organ in your body8212and even give you an edge on reversing the aging process and it8217s all due to the brainbeauty connection prior to the discovery of neuropeptides control of the brain and nervous system was thought to be accomplished through a complicated network of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine hormones like adrenaline and cortisol and enzymes today we know that matters are infinitely more complex as brain researcher dr steve henricksen once put it 8220we used to think the brain was like a computer now we think each cell is like a computer a separate computer and one single cell is like the whole brain8221 if the brain is at all like a collection of integrated highspeed computers neuropeptides seem to form the electrochemical communications web that keeps them balanced and working in unison there are cells in the brain that produce various neuropeptides and these neuropeptides do just about everything they can be either proinflammatory or antiinflammatory they are responsible for many functions they control our mood energy levels pain and pleasure reception body weight and ability to solve problems they also form memories and regulate our immune system these active little messengers in the brain actually turn on cellular function in the skin it8217s interesting to note that the immune system is an extension of the brain and that the skin is an immune organ beauty is much more than skin deep when i was a medical student we studied embryology there i learned that three layers of tissue develop into every organ system in our bodies one fact that particularly intrigued me was that the same layer of tissue that was responsible for the production of the brain also produced skin that is why when we eat a food or take a nutritional supplement that is therapeutic for the brain the skin improves this simple fact shaped much of my research into the role of peptides and neuropeptides in the brainbeauty connection while manipulating the neuropeptides neurotransmitters and hormones that are in the brain to help create younger more beautiful skin increase longevity and slow the aging process might seem more at home in a michael crichton or robin cook novel believe me when i tell you that it is not only possible but in fact the new reality scientists now know that these neuropeptides neurotransmitters and hormones have a vast cellular communications system neuropeptides are nature8217s 8220cell8221 phones there is a trio controlling every aspect of our bodies using neuropeptides as their messengers that is the brain signals the thymus which is the master gland of immunity more about this in chapter 2 the thymus signals the skin and the skin talks back to the brain every messenger has a recipient for its message these recipients are known as receptor sites think of it as 8220cellular communication8221 the cells communicate in the same way as making a phone call from your phone the messenger to another phone which is there to receive the call the receptor site there is no voice mail here8212it is a world in which for good or ill every call is answered instantly the message delivered at the receptor site depends upon the particular neuropeptide neurotransmitter or hormone making the call if high levels of the potentially harmful neuropeptide substance p which you will also learn more about in chapter 2 are being released in the brain for example we will experience 8220psychic pain82218212we will feel depressed and anxious substance p has receptor sites throughout the body including in the skin so the message or call sent to the receptors in the skin might be 8220we8217re depressed let8217s turn on inflammation in our skin cells today8221 the result accelerated aging of the skin through abnormal cell turnover loss of radiance and tone so the brain sends messages to the skin but remember this 8220phone system8221 circuitry goes both ways we now know that just by touching the skin we can actually change the circuitry in our brain this is an amazing concept if we take a minute to think about it usually we think it takes a powerful drug or surgical or therapeutic procedure of some sort to make any kind of significant change in the body or mind however studies have shown that just fifteen minutes of daily massage help premature infants gain weight faster enabling them to leave the hospital sooner than their counterparts the massaged babies are more relaxed active and alert six months later they continue to be more advanced studies in orphanages and hospitals repeatedly tell us that infants deprived of skin contact lose weight become ill and even die infants who are held cry less than those who are not their immune systems are enhanced and they handle stress more efficiently the need for touch continues throughout our lives when diabetic children were massaged for a month blood glucose levels decreased and they were able to reduce their medication levels asthmatic children had fewer attacks massage helped children with autism severe burns cancer and arthritis these are perfect illustrations of how neuropeptides can be activated in the brain from touch receptors in the skin and the neuropeptides released such as endorphins send a healing positive message to the brain neuropeptides come into their own i recently spoke with jim parker of the do it now foundation who shared with me some fascinating information on the world of neuropeptides back when they were first known as endorphins they were going to be the 8220magic bullets8221 of psychopharmacology miraculous chemical keys to unlock the secrets of pleasure and pain joy and sorrow memory intelligence and behavior they were supposed to explain everything from falling in love to falling asleep and a full understanding of their actions and effects was going to cure drug addiction and mental illness regulate mood and appetite and even heighten creativity and sexual response they were the endorphins the internally produced morphinelike substances responsible for an array of druglike effects in the body and for a while after their 1975 discovery everyone wanted to speculate about them but the euphoria didn8217t last life got complicated as research findings grew confusing then contradictory as the number of identified endorphins grew from month to month and scientists8217 understanding of their many effects broadened they became known as endogenous opioids and finally neuropeptides of which endorphins form a small subcategory investigators continued to look hard and long at the powerful new body of chemicals and quietly went about the difficult work of figuring them out8212or at least figuring out a way to figure them out in the process they linked them with a vast array of physical and emotional problems8212as both possible causes and potential cures8212and the prognosis is now good for at least some of the promised early magic bullets to hit their mark in human terms for the millions of people afflicted with a wide range of problems from alcoholism and obesity to chronic pain and schizophrenia the study of neuropeptides holds great promise botox notox one of the great joys of practicing dermatology is seeing immediate visible effects when the right treatment is applied to a particular condition this has been a great motivator for me throughout my career and it continues to provide the inspiration for spending many hours in the laboratory looking for that next miracle ingredient that can truly deliver results to the skin for far too long the beauty and skin care industry has focused on the look and feel of a product8212its packaging and its perfume as opposed to genuine efficacy since i first introduced topical formulations containing highly active ingredients such as alpha lipoic acid ala and dimethylaminoethanol dmae retailers have had a hard time keeping their shelves stocked with these products a new generation of women and men is controlling the marketplace8212a generation that not only wants but actually demands products that work overtime to keep them as young looking and as vital as possible i think this is an excellent development because it has now involved many major corporations in serious research aimed toward resolving the problems of aging skin however there is a somewhat alarming trend toward obtaining serious and very costly surgical procedures at a younger and younger age just turn on the tv and you will see some young woman still in her teens vying for radical surgery to turn herself into a clone of the current hot actress model or singer america seems to be gripped by manic radical makeover madness according to a new york times article 8220a lovelier you with offtheshelf parts8221 by alex kuczynski may 2 2004 americans underwent 83 million cosmetic surgery procedures in 2003 an increase of 12 percent over the previous year in addition to all the surgery new fillers designed to plump up facial lines are being rushed to market use of botox a neurotoxin neuro means 8220nerve8221 toxin means 8220poison8221 that paralyzes muscles to smooth out wrinkles and expression lines is rampant the kuczynski article reports that the number of nonsurgical procedures such as botox rose 22 percent over the previous year to 64 million these products offer a quick fix but there are questions about their longterm safety questions that won8217t be answered for years to come my ongoing goal is to find the notox solution to signs and symptoms of aging on the face and in the body this has led me to develop what might be termed the next generation of skin and body care8212the peptides and neuropeptides reversing the aging process in the wrinkle cure and the perricone prescription i introduced a major theme of my research the inflammationdiseaseaging connection because inflammation is a great contributor to accelerated aging it has been an important focus of my ongoing scientific research and we now know that neuropeptides and peptides play an important role in mediating inflammation for those of you who may not be familiar with the inflammationaging connection here is a quick review inflammation exists as a spectrum ranging from the highly visible such as bright red sunburn to the invisible it is this invisible inflammation that i am referring to when i use the term inflammation you can8217t see it and you can8217t feel it this invisible inflammation also called microinflammation exists in all of our cells and is responsible for their eventual breakdown it is responsible for the aging process that gives us wrinkled sagging skin as well as agerelated diseases as diverse as alzheimer8217s diabetes cancer cardiovascular disease arthritis and the autoimmune diseases simply put if we want to decrease our risk for agerelated diseases and decelerate the aging process then we need to control inflammation and we can do that best by controlling two essential lifestyle elements diet and stress diet and aging the sugar connection there are many causes of the inflammationaging process but i believe the primary cause is diet foods that we eat can either be proinflammatory they provoke an inflammatory response or antiinflammatory they suppress the inflammatory response proinflammatory foods are those that cause a rapid rise in blood sugar resulting in the release of insulin into the bloodstream the chief culprits in the proinflammatory arena are sugar and foods that quickly convert to sugar in the bloodstream such as potatoes breads pastries juice chips and rice cakes we have to understand and accept this simple but painful fact of life sugar can be toxic ingesting sugar causes a rise in blood sugar resulting in a burst of inflammatory chemicals that spread throughout our bodies even worse from a dermatological point of view is that sugar can permanently attach to the collagen present in our skin and other parts of our body through a process known as glycation where the sugar attaches there is a little mechanism creating inflammation and that attachment becomes a source of inflammation in its own right this inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen resulting in wrinkles in addition to creating inflammation glycation results in the crosslinking of our collagen making it stiff and inflexible8212somewhat like a soft supple leather boot that has been left out in the rain and is now hard and stiff and brittle but it8217s not only glycation of the skin we have to worry about the overconsumption of sugar produces stiff sugarprotein bonds which accumulate throughout our bodies as we get older the sugar or glucose molecule 8220glues8221 itself to our collagen as well as to our veins arteries ligaments bones8212even our brains we then suffer from stiff joints hardened arteries failing organs8212basically sugar contributes to the deterioration of every bodily function it8217s easy to see why we must avoid foods that cause elevated levels of sugar the perricone promise provides many excellent food choices recipes and meal plans that will prevent this ageaccelerating dietary inflammation stress and aging the anxiety connection a second very important mediator of inflammation is stress there are two kinds of stress8212 physical and psychic 8212and both cause inflammation physical stress can be caused by trauma wounds even the stretching of the skin from normal gravity there is pretty good evidence that the gravity pulling on your skin when you simply get out of bed in the morning can result in an inflammatory response in your skin my son often used this line to avoid school mental or psychic stress can be just as detrimental as physical stress when you are stressed regardless of the cause you produce neuropeptides that exert a negative effect on your brain by triggering the production of cortisol a hormone that can have dire consequences for your health when produced in large amounts cortisol is made by the adrenal glands which sit above the kidneys cortisol is needed to activate the body when it is under stress enabling us to survive physically dangerous situations through what is known as the fightorflight syndrome the release of cortisol allows our muscles to be fueled for action cortisol is an emergency hormone called into play in desperate situations however when a high level of cortisol circulates in the body for long periods of time it is toxic to our organ systems it will actually destroy brain cells elevate our blood sugar resulting in diabetes cause damage to the immune system making us more susceptible to infection and cancer elevate our blood pressure decalcify our bones and thin our skin the more stress you8217re under the greater the amount of cortisol produced these stressrelated neuropeptides and hormones also send messages to the immune system effectively shutting it down and that is not all the same neuropeptides send signals directly to the skin and produce an inflammatory response the more stress you have in your life the greater the chance that inflammation will occur somewhere in or on your body luckily the two major causes of inflammation8212diet and stress8212are also the most controllable in the perricone promise you will discover a variety of strategies to suppress the release of pro inflammatory neuropeptides the 8220bad8221 guys while encouraging the production of antiinflammatory neuropeptides the 8220good8221 guys 8226nbspnbsp in step 1 i will talk about diet and much of the very latest research on foods that have great antiinflammatory powers you will learn for instance a colorcoordinated system for choosing foods that have the highest amounts of natural peptide boosters and antiinflammatories 8226nbspnbsp in step 2 you will learn which nutritional supplements have significant antiinflammatory activity and be introduced to special polysaccharide peptide 8220foods8221 that have great therapeutic potential for the skin body and brain 8226nbspnbsp in step 3 i will add the topical products that include the latest scientific breakthrough on the antiagingantiinflammation front research over the past twenty years has uncovered the critical role of small hormonelike protein fragments called thymic peptides which exert beneficial antiaging antiinflammatory healing and anticancer effects in the body you8217ll learn which topical products contain these healing substances and how to apply them effectively to find out more about why peptides and neuropeptides are critical to the antiagingantiinflammation process read the next chapter it will help you understand how and why the foods supplements and topicals i8217m recommending will restore your looks and health in the meantime i urge you to start step 1 of the program so you don8217t spend one more unnecessary day prematurely aging your body and mind
