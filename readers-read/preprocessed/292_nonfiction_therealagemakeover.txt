years and gives you all the information you need to transform yourself with a realage makeover theres a lot in the realm of health and medicine we dont know but we do know more than 80 percent of how to postpone delay or avoid the onset of agerelated disease and the disability it causes thats extremely exciting news its different however from postponing aging itself postponing aging would mean living at the top of your curve to one hundred twenty or one hundred fifty years after your birth something very different from what we can do now we now know how to delay until age ninety or ninetyfive those agerelated diseases that keep us from living at the top of the qualityoflife curve and thats what the goal of the realage program is all about what is realage its most common of course when someone rudely asks you your age to think in terms of calendar age you are very aware and may even grumble when you pass the big milestones for example when you turn thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty or ninety but this way of thinking couching age only in terms of calendar age does not do justice to the complex and happily often reversible process of aging you have an age that more truly reflects how much your body has aged your realage it can be many years older or younger than your calendar age depending on your choices how well you care for your health and wellbeing if your realage is five years younger than your calendar age for example it means that your rate of aging is such that you are in the same shape physiologically as the average person who is five years younger than you likewise if your realage is five years older than your calendar age you have aged to the same biologic condition as someone who is five years older but you do not have to despair
