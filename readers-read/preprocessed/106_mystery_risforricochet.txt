 the basic question is this given human nature are any of us really capable of change the mistakes other people make are usually patently obvious our own are tougher to recognize in most cases our path through life reflects a fundamental truth about who we are now and who weve been since birth were optimists or pessimists joyful or depressed gullible or cynical inclined to seek adventure or to avoid all risks therapy might strengthen our assets or offset our liabilities but in the main we do what we do because weve always done it that way even when the outcome is badperhaps especially when the outcome is bad this is a story about romancelove gone right love gone wrong and matters somewhere in between i left downtown santa teresa that day at 115 and headed for montebello a short ten miles south the weather report had promised highs in the seventies morning cloudiness had given way to sunshine a welcomed respite from the overcast that typically mars our june and july id eaten lunch at my desk feasting on an oliveandpimientocheese sandwich on wheat bread cut in quarters my thirdfavorite sandwich in the whole wide world so what was the problem i had none life was great in committing the matter to paper i can see now what should have been apparent from the first but events seemed to unfold at such a routine pace that i was caught metaphorically speaking asleep at the wheel im a private detective female age thirtyseven working in the small southern california town of santa teresa my jobs are varied not always lucrative but sufficient to keep me housed and fed and ahead of my bills i do employee background checks i track down missing persons or locate heirs entitled to monies in the settlement of an estate on occasion i investigate claims involving arson fraud or wrongful death in my personal life ive been married and divorced twice and subsequent relationships have usually come to grief the older i get the less i seem to understand men and because of that i tend to shy away from them granted i have no sex life to speak of but at least im not plagued by unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases ive learned the hard way that love and work are a questionable mix i was driving on a stretch of highway once known as the montebello parkway built in 1927 as the result of a fundraising campaign that made possible the creation of frontage roads and landscaped center dividers still in evidence today because billboards and commercial structures along the roadway were banned at the same time that section of the 101 is still attractive except when its jammed with rushhour traffic montebello itself underwent a similar transformation in 1948 when the montebello protective and improvement association successfully petitioned to eliminate sidewalks concrete curbs advertising signs and anything else that might disrupt the rural atmosphere montebello is known for its twohundredsomeodd luxury estates many of them built by men whod amassed their fortunes selling common household goods salt and flour being two i was on my way to meet nord lafferty an elderly gentleman whose photograph appeared at intervals in the society column of the santa teresa dispatch this was usually occasioned by his making yet another sizable contribution to some charitable foundation two buildings at ucst had been named for him as had a wing of santa teresa hospital and a special collection of rare books hed donated to the public library hed called me two days before and indicated he had a modest undertaking he wanted to discuss i was curious how hed come by my name and even more curious about the job itself ive been a private investigator in santa teresa for the past ten years but my office is small and as a rule im ignored by the wealthy who seem to prefer doing business through their attorneys in new york chicago or la i took the st isadore offramp and turned north toward the foothills that ran between montebello and the los padres national forest at one time this area boasted grand old resort hotels citrus and avocado ranches olive groves a country store and the montebello train depot which serviced the southern pacific railroad im forever reading up on local history trying to imagine the region as it was 125 years ago land was selling then for seventyfive cents an acre montebello is still bucolic but much of the charm has been bulldozed away whats been erected insteadthe condominiums housing developments and the big flashy starter castles of the nouveau richeis poor compensation for what was lost or destroyed i turned right on west glen and drove along the winding twolane road as far as bella sera place bella sera is lined with olive and pepper trees the narrow blacktop climbing gradually to a mesa that affords a sweeping view of the coast the pungent scent of the ocean faded with my ascent replaced by the smell of sage and the bay laurel trees the hillsides were thick with yarrow wild mustard and california poppies the afternoon sun had baked the boulders to a golden turn and a warm chuffing wind was beginning to stir the dry grasses the road wound upward through an alley of live oaks that terminated at the entrance to the lafferty estate the property was surrounded by a stone wall that was eight feet high and posted with no trespassing signs i slowed to an idle when i reached the wide iron gates i leaned out and pushed the call button on a mounted keypad belatedly i spotted a camera mounted atop one of two stone pillars its hollow eye fixed on me i must have passed inspection because the gates swung open at a measured pace i shifted gears and sailed through following the brickpaved drive for another quarter of a mile through a picket fence of pines i caught glimpses of a gray stone house when the whole of the residence finally swept into view i let out a breath something of the past remained after all four towering eucalyptus trees laid a dappled shade on the grass and a breeze pushed a series of cloudshaped shadows across the red tile roof the twostory house with matching onestory wings topped with stone balustrades at each end dominated my visual field a series of four arches shielded the entrance and provided a covered porch on which wicker furniture had been arranged i counted twelve windows on the second floor separated by paired eave brackets largely decorative that appeared to support the roof i pulled onto a parking pad sufficient to accommodate ten cars and left my pale blue vw hunched cartoonlike between a sleek lincoln continental on one side and a fullsize mercedes on the other i didnt bother to lock up operating on the assumption that the electronic surveillance system was watching over both me and my vehicle as i crossed to the front walk the lawns were wide and well tended and the quiet was underlined by the twittering of finches i pressed the front bell listening to the hollowsounding chimes inside clanging out two notes as though by a hammer on iron the ancient woman who came to the door wore an oldfashioned black uniform with a white pinafore over it her opaque stockings were the color of doll flesh her crepesoled shoes emitting the faintest squeak as i followed her down the marbletiled hall she hadnt asked my name but perhaps i was the only visitor expected that day the corridor was paneled in oak the white plaster ceiling embossed with chevrons and fleursdelis she showed me into the library which was also paneled in oak drab leatherbound books lined shelves that ran floor to ceiling with a brass rail and a rolling ladder allowing access to the upper reaches the room smelled of dry wood and paper mold the inner hearth in the stone fireplace was tall enough to stand in and a recent blaze had left a partially blackened oak log and the faint stench of wood smoke mr lafferty was seated in one of a pair of matching wing chairs i placed him in his eighties an age id considered elderly once upon a time ive since come to realize how widely the aging process varies my landlord is eightyseven the baby of his family with siblings whose ages range as high as ninetysix all five of them are lively intelligent adventurous competitive and given to goodnatured squabbling among themselves mr lafferty on the other hand looked as though hed been old for a good twenty years he was inordinately thin with knees as bony as a pair of misplaced elbows his once sharp features had at least been softened by the passing years two small clear plastic tubes had been placed discreetly in his nostrils tethering him to a stout green oxygen tank on a cart to his left one side of his jaw was sunken and a savage red line running across his throat suggested extensive surgery of some vicious sort he studied me with eyes as dark and shiny as dots of brown sealing wax i appreciate your coming ms millhone im nord lafferty he said holding out a hand that was knotted with veins his voice was hoarse barely a whisper nice to meet you i murmured moving forward to shake hands with him his were pale a tremor visible in his fingers which were icy to the touch he motioned to me you might want to pull that chair close ive had thyroid surgery a month ago and more recently some polyps removed from my vocal cords ive been left with this rasping noise that passes as speech isnt painful but its irksome i apologize if im difficult to understand so far im not having any problem good would you like a cup of tea i can have my housekeeper make a pot but im afraid youll have to pour for yourself these days her hands arent any steadier than mine thanks but im fine i pulled the second wing chair closer and took a seat when was this house built its really beautiful 1893 a man named mueller bought a sixhundredfortyacre section from the county of santa teresa of that seventy acres remain house took six years to build and the story has it mueller died the day the workers finally set down their tools since then the occupants have fared poorlyexcept for me knock on wood i bought the property in 1929 just after the crash fellow who owned the place lost everything drove into town climbed up to the clock tower and dived over the rail widow needed the cash and i stepped in i was criticized of course folks claimed i took advantage but id loved the house from the minute i laid eyes on it someone would have bought it better me than them i had money for the upkeep which wasnt true of many folks back then you were lucky indeed made my fortune in paper goods in case youre curious and too polite to inquire i smiled polite i dont know about im always curious thats fortunate id say given the business youre in im assuming youre a busy woman so ill get right to the point your name was given to me by a friend of yoursfellow i met during this recent hospital stay stacey oliphant i said the name flashing immediately to mind id worked a case with stacey a retired sheriffs department homicide detective and my old pal lieutenant dolan now retired from the santa teresa police department stacey was battling cancer but the last id heard hed been given a reprieve mr lafferty nodded he asked me to tell you hes doing well by the way he checked in for a battery of tests but all of them turned out negative as it happened the two of us walked the halls together in the afternoons and i got chatting about my daughter reba i was already thinking skip trace missing heir possibly a background check on a guy if reba were romantically involved he went on i only have the one child and i suppose ive spoiled her unmercifully though that wasnt my intent her mother ran off when she was just a little thing this high i was caught up in business and left the daytoday raising of her to a series of nannies shed been a boy i could have sent her off to boarding school the way my parents did me but i wanted her at home in retrospect i see that mightve been poor judgment on my part but it didnt seem so at the time he paused and then gestured impatiently toward the floor as though chiding a dog for leaping up on him no matter its too late for regrets pointless anyway whats done is done he looked at me sharply from under his bony brow you probably wonder what im driving at i proffered a slight shrug waiting to hear what he had to say rebas being paroled on july twentieth thats next monday morning i need someone to pick her up and bring her home shell be staying with me until shes on her feet again what facility i asked hoping i didnt sound as startled as i felt california institution for women are you familiar with the place its down in corona couple of hundred miles south ive never actually been there but i know where it is good im hoping you can take time out of your schedule for the trip that sounds easy enough but why me i charge five hundred dollars a day you dont need a private detective to make a run like that doesnt she have friends not anyone id ask dont worry about the money thats the least of it my daughters difficult willful and rebellious i want you to see to it she keeps the appointment with her parole officer and whatever else is required once shes been released ill pay you your full rate even if you only work for a part of each day what if she doesnt like the supervision its not up to her ive told her im hiring someone to assist her and shes agreed if she likes you shell be cooperative at least to a point may i ask what she did given the time youll be spending in her company youre entitled to know she was convicted of embezzling money from the company she worked for alan beckwith and associates he does property management real estate investment and development things of that type do you know the man ive seen his name in the paper nord lafferty shook his head i dont care for him myself ive known his wifes family for years tracys a lovely girl i cant understand how she ended up with the likes of him alan beckwith is an upstart he calls himself an entrepreneur but ive never been entirely clear what he does our paths have crossed in public on numerous occasions and i cant say im impressed reba seems to think the world of him i will credit him for thishe spoke up in her behalf before her sentencing it was a generous gesture on his part and one he didnt have to make how long has she been at ciw shes served twentytwo months of a fouryear sentence she never went to trial at her arraignmentwhich im sorry to say i missedshe claimed she was indigent so the court appointed a public defender to handle her case after consultation with him she waived her right to a preliminary hearing and entered a plea of guilty just like that im afraid so and her attorney agreed to it he argued strenuously against it but reba wouldnt listen how much money are we talking three hundred fifty thousand dollars over a twoyear period howd they discover the theft during a routine audit reba was one of a handful of employees with access to the accounts naturally suspicion fell on her shes been in trouble before but nothing of this magnitude i could feel a protest welling but i bit back my response he leaned forward you have something to say feel free to say it stacey tells me youre outspoken so please dont hesitate on my account it may save us a misunderstanding i was just wondering why you didnt step in a highpowered attorney might have made all the difference he dropped his gaze to his hands i should have helped heri know thatbut id been coming to her rescue for many many yearsall her life if you want to know the truth at least thats what i was being told by friends they said she had to face the consequences of her behavior or she was never going to learn they said id be enabling that saving her was the worst possible action under the circumstances whos this they youre referring to for the first time he faltered i had a lady friend lucinda wed been keeping company for years shed seen me intercede in rebas behalf on countless occasions she persuaded me to put my foot down and thats what i did and now frankly i was shocked when reba was sentenced to four years in state prison i had no idea the penalty would be so stiff i thought the judge would suspend sentence or agree to probation as the public defender suggested at any rate lucinda and i quarreled bitterly i might add i broke off the relationship and severed my ties with her she was much younger than i in hindsight i realized she was angling for herself hoping for marriage reba disliked her intensely lucinda knew that of course what happened to the money reba gambled it away shes always been attracted to card play roulette the slots she loves to bet the ponies but she has no head for it shes a problem gambler her problem isnt the gambling its the losing he remarked with only the weakest of smiles what about drugs and alcohol id have to answer yes on both counts she tends to be reckless she has a wild streak like her mother im hoping this experience in prison has taught her selfrestraint as for the job itself well play that by ear were talking two to three days a week at the most until shes reestablished herself since your responsibilities are limited i wont be requiring a written report submit an invoice and ill pay your daily rate and all the necessary expenses that seems simple enough one other item if theres any suggestion that shes backsliding i want to be informed perhaps with sufficient warning i can head off disaster this time around a tall order im aware of that briefly i considered the proposition ordinarily i dont like serving as a babysitter and potential tattletale but in this case his concern didnt seem out of line what time will she be released
