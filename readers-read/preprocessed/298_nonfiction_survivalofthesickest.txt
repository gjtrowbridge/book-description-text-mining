 if youre of asian descent and have ever had an alcoholic beverage theres a fiftyfifty chance your heart rate shot up your temperature climbed and your face turned bright red if youre not asian but youve ever been in a bar frequented by people with an asian background chances are youve seen this reaction its called asian flush or more formally alcohol flush response it happens to as many as half of all people of asian descent but its uncommon in just about every other population group so whats the story when you consume alcohol your body detoxifies it and then extracts calories from it its a complex process that involves many different enzymes and multiple organs although most of the process takes place in the liver first an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase converts the alcohol into another chemical called acetaldehyde another enzymemdashcleverly called acetaldehyde dehydrogenasemdashconverts the acetaldehyde into acetate and a third enzyme converts that into fat carbon dioxide and water the calories synthesized from alcohol are generally stored as fatmdashbeer bellies really do come from beer many asians have a genetic variation labeled aldh22 that causes them to produce a less powerful form of acetaldehyde dehydrogenasemdashone that isnt as effective in converting acetaledehyde that first byproduct of alcohol into acetate acetaldehyde is thirty times as toxic as alcohol even very small amounts can produce nasty reactions and one of those reactions is the flushing response thats not all it does of course after even one drink by people who have the aldh22 variation the acetaldehyde buildup causes them to appear drunk blood rushes to their face chest and neck dizziness and extreme nausea set inmdashand the drinker is on the road to a nasty hangover of course theres a side benefit to all thismdashpeople who have aldh22 are highly resistant to alcoholism its just too unpleasant for them to drink in fact the resistance to alcoholism is so strong in people with aldh22 that doctors often prescribe alcoholics with a drug called disulfiram which essentially mirrors the aldh22 effect disulfiram antabuse interferes with the bodys own supply of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme so anyone who drinks alcohol while taking it ends up with something that looks an awful lot like asian flush and feels truly awful to boot so why is the aldh22 variation so common among asians and virtually nonexistent among europeans its all about clean water as humans began to settle in cities and towns they got their first taste of the sanitation and waste management problems that still plague cities todaymdashbut without even the possibility of modern plumbing this made clean water a real challenge and some theories suggest that different civilizations came up with different solutions in europe they used fermentationmdashand the resulting alcohol killed microbes even when as was often the case it was mixed with water on the other side of the world people purified their water by boiling it and making tea as a result there was evolutionary pressure in europe to have the ability to drink break down and detoxify alcohol while the pressure in asia was a lot less from chapter v of microbes and men the family of streptococcal bacteria is responsible for a wide range of human diseasemdashfrom strep throat to scarlet fever bacterial pneumonia and rheumatic fever many types of streptococcal bacteria exhibit a phenomenon called molecular mimicry in which they display characteristics of human cells in order to trick the immune system the cells these bacteria mimic include cells found in the heart the joints and even the brain when you have a bacterial infection your immune system produces antibodies to attack the invaders when the invaders are partially disguised through molecular mimicry they can cause an autoimmune disorder the immune system recognizes the threat posed by bacterial invaders but the antibodies it produces attack all the cells that resemble the bacteriamdashincluding the bodys own cells thats how some children who have rheumatic fever end up with heart problemsmdashantibodies attack the heart valve because the infecting bacteria resembles it in some ways dr susan swedo a researcher at the national institute of mental health believes that certain strep infections can trigger an autoimmune disorder that leads to an antibodyled attack on the basal ganglia the part of the brain believed to control movement researchers call this condition pandasmdashpediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection parents of children with pandas describe heartbreaking transformations often overnight shortly after infection children suddenly display repetitive tics and uncontrolled touching as well as serious anxiety its not clear that this is actual host manipulationmdashthat depends on whether the change in behavior helps the bacteria to spread theoretically of course its not hard to imagine how uncontrolled repetitive touching of toys furniture and other kids would help the virus to spread its also possible that there is a relationship between obsessivecompulsive disorder and strep infections that isnt host manipulation itself but the byproduct of the bacterias effort to fool the immune system one thing is clearmdashwe are just beginning to understand the myriad ways our behavior is affected by infectious agents one very new avenue of research is exploring the striking possibility that sexually transmitted diseases may actually influence sexual behavior now im not suggesting that this kind of influence will transform a happily married man into an insatiable cheat in fact that wouldnt necessarily be in the viruss or funguss or bacterias interest too much promiscuity on the part of the host could disable it with other potentially more damaging diseases and that would leave the parasite stuck in a host that couldnt get around from the sexually transmitted parasites point of view it may want you to have more sexmdashbut not too much sex as far as diseases influencing human sexual behavior some researchers are examining the possibility that genital herpes may affect human sexual feeling in a way that could influence behavior two researchers at the department of anatomy and neurobiology at the university of california at irvine carolyn g hatalski and w ian lipkin have speculated that the herpes virus may heighten sexual feeling because it is so intertwined with the nerves that carry those feelings they wrote it is intriguing to speculate that the ganglion infection may modulate sensory input to sex organs leading to increased sexual activity and enhanced probability of virus transmission in other words sometimes the herpes virus may want you to get some action from chapter viii thats life why you and your ipod must die seth cook is the oldest living american with a particularly rare genetic disorder hes lost all his hair his skin is covered in wrinkles his arteries are hardened his joints hurt from arthritis he takes an aspirin and a blood thinner every day he is twelve years old seth has hutchinsongilford progeria syndrome often just called progeria progeria is very raremdashthought to occur in just 1 of every 4 to 8 million births its also very unfair the word comes from the greek for prematurely old and thats the difficult fate in store for people born with it children who have progeria age at up to ten times the speed of people without it by the time a baby who has progeria is about a year and a half old his or her skin starts to wrinkle and their hair starts to fall out cardiovascular problems like hardening of the arteries and degenerative diseases like arthritis soon follow most people who have progeria die in their teens of a heart attack or a stroke nobody is known to have lived past thirty hutchinsongilford progeria isnt the only disease that causes accelerated agingmdashits just the most heartbreaking because its the fastest and it starts at birth another aging disorder werner syndrome doest manifest itself until someone carrying the mutation that causes it reaches puberty its sometimes called adultonset progeria after puberty rapid aging sets in and people who have werner syndrome usually die of age related disease by their early fifties werner syndrome although more common than hutchinsongilford progeria is still very rare affecting just one in a million because these rapidaging diseases are so uncommon they havent been the focus of much research and theyre called orphan diseases for that reason but thats starting to change as scientists have realized that they hold clues about the normal aging process in april 2003 researchers announced that they had isolated the genetic mutation that causes progeria the mutation occurs in a gene that is responsible for the production of a protein called lamin a normally lamin a provides structural support for the nuclear membrane the package that houses your genes at the core of every cell lamin a is like the rods that hold up a tentmdashthe nuclear membrane is organized around it and supported by it in people who have progeria lamin a is defective and cells deteriorate much more rapidly in 2006 a different team of researchers established a link between lamin a deterioration and normal human aging tom misteli and paola scaffidi researchers at the national institutes of health reported in science that the cells of normal elderly people show the same kinds of defects that are found in the cells of people who have progeria thats very significantmdashits the first confirmation that the accelerated aging that characterizes progeria is related to normal human aging on a genetic level the implications are farreaching more or less since darwin described adaptation natural selection and evolution scientists have been debating where aging fits into the picture is it just wear and tear the way your favorite shirt picks up little stains and rips and marks over the years eventually fraying and wearing out or is it the product of evolution in other words is aging accidental or intentional progeria and the other acceleratedaging diseases suggest that aging is preprogrammed that its part of the design think about itmdashif a single genetic error can trigger accelerated aging in a baby or an adolescent then aging cant only be caused by a lifetime of wear and tear the very existence of the progeria gene demonstrates that there could be genetic controls for aging that of course raises a question youve no doubt come to expect are we programmed to die leonard hayflick is one of the fathers of modern aging research during the 1960s he discovered that with one special exception cells only divide a fixed number of times before they up and quit this limit on cellular reproduction is appropriately called the hayflick limit in humans the limit is around fiftytwo to sixty the hayflick limit is related to the loss of a genetic buffer at the end of chromosomes called telomeres every time a cell reproduces it loses a little bit of dna in order to prevent that information loss from making a difference your chromosomes have what amounts to extra information at their tips those bits of information are telomeres imagine you have a manuscript and need to make fifty copies but kinkos has just thrown you a curveball instead of charging you money theyre just going to take one page off the end of your manuscript after every copy thats a problemmdashyour manuscript is two hundred pages long if you give them a page after every copy the last copy is only going to have one hundred fifty pages and whoever gets it is going to miss a quarter of the story so being a highly evolved organism with a gift for clever solutions you add fifty blank pages to the end of your manuscript and present kinkos with a twohundredfiftypage manuscript now all fifty copies will have the complete story you wont lose a page of precious information until you decide to make copy fiftyone telomeres are like blank pages as cells reproduce telomeres are shortened and the truly valuable dna is protected but once a cell replicates between fifty and sixty times the telomeres are essentially gone and the good stuff is in jeopardy now why would we evolve a limit against cellular reproduction in a word cancer
