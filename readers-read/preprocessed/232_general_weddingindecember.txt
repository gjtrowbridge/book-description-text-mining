the glaciers are receding8221 she said nora peered through the window as if she could see the progress of said glaciers some ten thousand miles north 8220i read it in the paper this morning8221 the view harrison had noted before he8217d sat down was of stillgreen lawns and dormant rosebushes of a wrought iron fence and a garden bench of ornamental grasses and white pines beyond the considerable acreage was a steel ribbon of river and beyond that a range of mountains bluegray in the morning light 8220the birds must be confused8221 he said 8220they are i i see them flying north all the time8221 8220is it bad for business8221 8220no not really no one8217s canceled though the ski areas are suffering8221 nora left the window and moved to the chair opposite he watched her cross her legs a cuff riding just above the edge of a black leather boot and making a slim bracelet of smooth white skin harrison superimposed the woman he saw now over the memory of the seventeenyearold girl he8217d once known a girl with a soft face and large almondshaped eyes a girl who had been graceful in her movements the woman before him was fortyfour and some of the softness had left her face her hair was different too she wore it short swept behind her ears a cut that looked more european than american when they8217d met just moments earlier at the foot of the stairs in the front hallway nora had been standing at a small reception desk she8217d glanced up and seen harrison and for a moment she8217d examined him as an innkeeper might a guest one had not yet attended to harrison she8217d said then advancing and his own smile had begun as nora had embraced him harrison had felt both unnerved and buoyant8212a cork floating in uncharted waters 8220your your room is comfortable8221 she asked he remembered this about her the slight stutter as if hesitant to speak no not a stutter more a stutter step 8220very8221 he said 8220great views8221 8220can i get you something tea coffee8221 8220coffee would be fine that8217s quite a machine there8221 8220it makes espresso with a lot of crema8221 she said standing 8220it8217s a draw actually some of the guests have said they8217ve come back for the coffee in the library well for that and for the dumbwaiter i put the dining room upstairs to take advantage of the views8221 on either side of the bookshelves were half columns and below those shelves were cabinets on one wall there was a builtin bench upholstered in lichen stripes the windows8212a set of three facing west8212had panes in the tops only so that from the leather couch on which harrison was seated he had an unobstructed view of the mountains 8220how long has this been an inn8221 he asked 8220two years8221 8220i was sorry to hear about your husband8221 8220you sent a card8221 he nodded surprised that nora remembered there must have been hundreds perhaps thousands of cards for such a distinguished man 8220renovations8221 she said making a gesture so as to take in the entire building 8220renovations had to be made8221 8220you8217ve done a terrific job8221 he replied slightly jarred by the non sequitur harrison had followed signs from the center of town to the inn and then had taken the long drive up the hill to the top when he8217d reached the parking lot the view of the berkshire mountains had opened up and stopped his heart in the same way that as a boy at cinerama his heart had always paused as the camera had soared up and over a cliff edge to reveal the grand canyon or the rift valley or the ice fields of antarctica he8217d walked with his suitcase to the front steps noting along the way the pruned bushes the raked lawns and in a maze that had perhaps lost its challenge the expertly trimmed hedges the inn was sheathed in white clapboards and shingles and sported a chimney that tilted slightly forward the windows unadorned shone in the morning light like many houses built at the turn of the century it had gables of differing widths and porches sprouting unconventionally at odd angles the outline of the roof harrison thought would be almost impossible to draw from memory inside the inn had a crisp edge that had been accomplished in part harrison thought with a great deal of white paint and chrome much as he admired the inn however he wondered if visitors ever lamented the lost house the one carl laski had inhabited 8220this used to be an inn years ago8221 nora said 8220after world war ii it became a private home there8217s an early photograph behind you on the wall8221 harrison stood and leaned in toward the wall balancing himself with his hand on the back of the couch the photograph framed in dark walnut was remarkably detailed and clear every blade of grass and twig made distinct with a kind of vision denied the naked eye the picture was of a white shingled building with a cupola on its roof it looked to be november or early march to judge from the light dusting of snow that outlined the furrows of a garden at the river8217s edge there was a trail of mist but he saw on closer inspection that it was really smoke from a moving train the train itself a blur merely a shadow 8220the photograph dates from 19128221 nora said 8220it was made from a glass negative there8217s a rose garden there and a racetrack8221 harrison sat again on the couch and wondered if anyone else had arrived yet he had wanted to be the first to see nora without the noise of the others 8220it was an inn then a house and then an inn again8221 he asked she smiled at his confusion 8220when carl and i moved here it was a private house we lived here for fifteen years after he died after he died i had the idea of reconverting it to an inn it had always wanted to be an inn even when it was a house8221 8220how many rooms are there8221 8220there used to be twentytwo8221 8220how did you manage8221 8220we closed most of the rooms off would you like more coffee8221 8220no thanks i8217m fine any of the others here yet8221 8220agnes said she8217d be here by lunch bill and bridget too rob rob won8217t be here until later8221 8220rob8217s coming8221 harrison asked with pleasure he hadn8217t seen rob zoar in well in twentyseven years harrison was startled by the number and recalculated yes twentyseven 8220he8217s in boston now isn8217t he i think i read that8221 8220he performs all over the world he gets wonderful reviews8221 8220i was surprised to hear he was a pianist he kept it quiet at kidd didn8217t he8221 8220i think he tried to resist it8221 8220it seems like this wedding came together very fast8221 he said 8220it did8221 too fast for harrison8217s wife evelyn to rearrange her schedule bill had sent harrison an email saying that he and bridget were getting married8212at the inn8212and he wanted harrison and evelyn to come harrison and bill had for a time kept in touch their families had gone skiing together twice but harrison had had no idea at all about bill and bridget 8220bridget8217s sick8221 nora added 8220it8217s why bill wants to do it now8221 8220how sick8221 harrison asked 8220very8221 nora said her face tight 8220do you remember them together8221 8220at school of course8221 bill had been a muscular catcher a consistent hitter with power who had routinely sent the baseball over the fence bridget a serious girl was pretty in a slightly plump way in another era she8217d have been a beauty the couple used to cross the campus so entwined it was as if they were one creature harrison recalled how disillusioned he had been when he8217d heard that each had married someone else 8220how did they reconnect8221 he asked now 8220our twentyfifth did you ever go to any of the reunions8221 he shook his head he8217d told himself that he hadn8217t gone for evelyn8217s sake she was canadian she wouldn8217t have known anyone the journey would have consumed too many of her precious days off but harrison couldn8217t satisfactorily explain why he hadn8217t gone by himself the simple answer he supposed was that he hadn8217t wanted to the sight of the invitations had produced in him an anxiety he had no intention of exploring even this small reunion8212this hasty wedding8212had made him hesitate 8220you8221 he asked nora shook her head and harrison was not surprised he could not imagine carl laski at a kidd reunion 8220have you seen any of the others8221 nora asked 8220since school i mean8221 8220well bill8221 he said 8220and i met jerry in new york about five years ago we had drinks8221 8220he8217s coming with his wife julie8221 nora said 8220what was it like meeting jerry8221 8220he mostly wanted me to know how successful he8217d become8221 harrison said and then shrugged to take the edge off the unkind comment 8220you8217re staying until sunday8221 nora asked 8220i think that8217s the plan8221 harrison had flown from toronto to hartford rented a car and driven to the massachusetts turnpike which he had followed west he8217d realized as he8217d driven that he8217d never been to western massachusetts when he had visited new england before it had always been to boston and then straight on to kidd in maine never inland he8217d known of the berkshires of course tanglewood the summer home of the boston symphony orchestra was world famous edith wharton had summered in lenox melville had written moby dick in pittsfield 8220there are some good walks8221 nora said gesturing toward the windows 8220the weather the weather is amazing8221 8220it8217s been unseasonable in toronto as well very mild8221 8220each day has been more beautiful than the last8221 she said 8220i think nature means to mock us8221 8220how so8221 82209118221 harrison nodded slowly 8220all that horror all that grief8221 she paused 8220people people are stopping one another on the streets and saying can you imagine and isn8217t this extraordinary and enjoy it while you can 8221 8220they say the temperature is breaking all records8221 8220i think it will reach seventytwo today8221 she said 8220surely a record for the first week in december8221 8220i wonder i wonder if the idea is that the sins of man more terrible than anyone8217s ability to imagine them are nothing in the face of nature8217s bounty and serenity8221 nora said 8220nature a supreme being8221 harrison asked puzzled 8220entity8221 8220a terrible one at times8221 8220not today8221 8220no not today8221 harrison said 8220or or are we meant to be reminded of a reason to stay alive to savor each day as if it might be the last8221 8220nature capable of grace8221 harrison asked 8220i like that8221 nora laughed reached forward and touched him lightly at the tip of his knee 8220listen to us8221 she said 8220we8217re so pretentious we used to do this all the time in mr mitchell8217s class didn8217t we8221 8220we did8221 he said glad that she remembered more gladdened by her sudden touch 8220it8217s great to see you8221 she said with seemingly genuine pleasure 8220where were you when it happened8221 he asked 8220here in the kitchen i turned on the tv just before the second plane hit judy my assistant8212you8217re bound to meet her8212came in and told me what about you8221 8220i was in toronto8221 he said 8220i was eating breakfast i had a cup of coffee and the newspaper on the television the announcer8217s voice changed in pitch and i looked up in time to see a plane hit the second tower8221 the images of that day had played and replayed for hours canadian television more willing to air the most horrific images8212those falling bodies8212than american stations had been 8220were you frightened8221 he asked 8220here no not really upset very upset but not frightened i thought of carl i was glad he wasn8217t alive to see it8221 nora began to nibble at the skin at the top of her index finger abruptly she stopped putting her hands in her lap with a decisive gesture from behind the shut door of the library harrison could hear a vacuum cleaner 8220they say it8217s the death of literature8221 she added 8220i think that8217s a little extreme8221 he said shifting his position on the couch in the days following the tragedy he8217d been greatly annoyed by such dramatic remarks 8220i admired your husband8217s work very much8221 he added feeling remiss that he hadn8217t mentioned this earlier 8220he he was a wonderful man8221 nora said 8220a wonderful poet and a wonderful man8221 8220yes8221 8220i was the helpmeet8221 nora said surprising harrison with the archaic word 8220i8217ve i8217ve never understood what that means exactly helpmeet help meet 8221 8220i8217ll look it up for you8221 he offered 8220i could do it myself i must have a dictionary somewhere 8221 she gazed at the spines of the books that lined the shelves for harrison the brilliance of carl laski8217s work lay in its oblique nature the way the point of a poem was often a glancing blow a glimpsed headline across the breakfast table while a woman tells her husband she has a lover or a man berating his wife on a cell phone in an airport lounge as he passes a small child sitting alone with a bright red suitcase later it will be the memory of the child with the suitcase that will bring the man to his knees in his hotel room harrison of course knew of laski8217s reputation the poet had won numerous international prizes had been the recipient of honorary degrees had been8212when he8217d died8212professor emeritus at st martin8217s college at which he had founded the celebrated st martin8217s writers school and from which he had sent out into the world a disproportionate share of poets laski harrison had read regarded the writing of poetry as man8217s highest calling and therefore worth the inevitable squandering of happy marriages and good health to say nothing of sound finances largely due to his efforts poetry had been enjoying something of a renaissance when he8217d died though one so mild as to barely register on the north american consciousness not one man in forty could today name a living poet harrison thought not one in a hundred could say who carl laski had been harrison had also read the roscoff biography a book that purported to be literary but showed almost no interest in the work itself rather roscoff had focused on the more lurid aspects of laski8217s life his abusive father his early drinking problem his nearly obsessive womanizing while a professor at new york university his disastrous first marriage the loss of his sons in a bitter custody battle and his subsequent selfimposed and somewhat misanthropic exile to the backwater college of st martin8217s in western massachusetts 8220your husband should have won the nobel prize8221 harrison said nora laughed 8220if he were here he8217d agree with you8221 8220was it difficult for him being passed up year after year8221 8220it it was an event each time it was awarded i mean that it would register like a small seismic shudder he8217d hear the news or read it in the newspaper or someone would call and tell him and his face for just a moment would cave in even as he was ranting about the winner or reading another part of the paper the only time the only time he didn8217t mind personally was when seamus heaney won he loved seamus8221 harrison set down his cup laski had been thirty years older than nora the two had met when nora was nineteen laski fortynine 8220was it ever an issue between you8212the age difference8221 he asked 8220only that he had to die before me8221 harrison listened for a note of bitterness or grief 8220we always knew it would happen8221 she added harrison nodded 8220we just didn8217t know it would be so awful one night one night when it was really bad carl said 8216it8217s so easy8217 i thought he meant the pain that somehow the pain had eased up but he meant dying that he8217d found an easy way to die8221 laski had filled his bathtub plugged in the hair dryer and let it drop harrison remembered precisely where he8217d been when he learned the startling news an editor harrison had once worked with in toronto had walked by his table in a new york city restaurant bent down and murmured have you heard about carl laski 8220a terrible end to a magnificent life8221 harrison said now nora was silent 8220the courage to do that8221 he added 8220carl carl would have said 8216cowardice82178221 8220he had throat cancer8221 8220he kept saying that he could never have described the pain not even at the height of his powers that it defied words8221 8220it8217s hard for the healthy to imagine pain like that8221 8220but what was truly horrible carl always said was the knowing knowing he was going to die8221 harrison agreed he could think of few things in life worse than knowing when one was going to die for it seemed to him that all the days in between8212between the now and the then 8212would be tainted poisoned by that bitter knowledge 8220in the end he picked his own time8221 he said nora stood smoothing the hem of her blouse across the flat of her stomach she had the body of a woman who had not had children and harrison thought briefly of his wife8217s body muscular and elongated from swimming yet still there was the small curve of her belly a swelling he loved to touch 8220want to sit outside8221 nora asked opening the double doors harrison expected a sudden chill but the air that came in from the small veranda outside the library was warm 8220you and agnes have stayed friends i take it8221 he said as he stood 8220yes we we don8217t see each other much but we write she8217s kind of oldfashioned our agnes she stayed on at kidd she teaches there8221 harrison remembered agnes8217s sturdy body her dreamy nature her fascination with history 8220she finally bought a computer when the school put a gun to her head8221 nora said 8220she hides it under the bed and takes it out only to post her grades8221 harrison laughed 8220bridget8217s mother and sister will come for the wedding bill8217s family won8217t come they8217re angry with him for well for leaving his wife and daughter for bridget bridget8217s son is bringing a friend to keep him company they8217re fifteen it8217ll be a small wedding more a wedding supper than a wedding though bill is intent upon the details i8217ve helped him plan the flowers and the menu he wants it to be perfect for bridget8221 8220what8217s wrong with her8221 harrison asked 8220breast cancer8221 harrison sucked in his breath the mother of a fifteenyearold boy he didn8217t want to think about it he shaded his eyes with his hand 8220what8217s that over there8221 he asked 8220it8217s the top of a roller coaster8221 nora said cheerfully 8220in the summer with binoculars you can see the people in the cars you can watch them make the long slow climb to the top and then hurtle out of sight below the trees then as if by magic you can see them emerge again they seem to spin off into the air8221 8220i8217ve never been on a roller coaster8221 harrison confessed 8220the closest i8217ve ever come is when my mother used to take me to cinerama when i was a kid8221 8220i don8217t think i ever went to cinerama8221 8220it was the first of the widescreen movies it made you feel as though you were right there8212sitting in the car of a roller coaster or climbing a mountain it was meant to give you the thrill and sensation of movement8221 8220i can8217t do it anymore8221 she said 8220the roller coaster carl did though he8217d snatch at any excuse to go he8217d borrow children if necessary8221 she looked at her watch and harrison thought about the notion of borrowing children 8220tell me about yourself8221 she said 8220not much to tell8221 8220you8217re married8221 8220yes my wife and i live in toronto with our two boys charlie and tom evelyn my wife is an estate lawyer8221 8220how did you end up there in toronto8221 8220evelyn is from toronto8221 8220you8217re in publishing8221 8220yes8221 nora rocked herself in a chair 8220tell me more about your wife8221 8220evelyn well let8217s see she8217s french canadian she8217s tall and has short blond hair i think her hair might actually be gray now but she never lets anyone see it she8217s a very good mother8221 harrison had then a quick image of evelyn and the boys at home he could see the interior of their town house particularly the small cluttered kitchen a jumble of laundry including his boys8217 slippery red hockey shirts would have spilled out onto the floor from the alcove where the washer and dryer were stowed he could see the breakfast table with its boxes of american cereal that the boys favored a tea bag rolled and hardened on a saucer evelyn would be in a pink cashmere robe harrison had given her for her birthday and her hair would be askew from sleep in the background would be the steady patter of an early morning news show and harrison realized as he saw and heard this scene that he did not wish himself there with that realization came an emptiness he was all too familiar with an emptiness that opened up whenever he found himself alone in a foreign place8212a sense of floating of not being anchored in the way that chores and hockey games and engagements will do 8220my older son charlie who8217s eleven has evelyn8217s looks but my disposition8221 harrison said 8220while tom who8217s nine is the spitting image of me but has evelyn8217s disposition8221 he paused 8220it8217s occasionally deeply unsettling8221 he added smiling 8220and what disposition would that be8221 nora asked 8220evelyn8217s8221 8220yes8221 8220oh i think most people would say she tends to be somewhat more dramatic than i am8221 harrison answered feeling mildly disloyal 8220and so you would be 8221 8220more even tempered8221 he said 8220yes i can see that8221 nora said sometimes evelyn seemed closer to harrison the farther away he was from her in a strict physical sense when they were separated he tended to think of her with more fondness than when he was with her and he wondered if she felt the same he sometimes thought that he had disappointed her in marriage8212or rather that marriage with its promise of constant love and physical intimacy had disappointed them both in her most dramatic and paradoxically romantic moments evelyn reproached herself for not having loved harrison enough but he couldn8217t ease her mind on this point without admitting to the death of hope together they cared for the boys attended to their jobs and had made he thought a good family and occasionally there were moments of true joy as when one or the other of the boys would say something winsome at the dinner table and harrison would catch evelyn8217s eye or as when lying together in the bed having made love in the forgiving halflight of an early sunday morning a kind of weekly hurdle crossed evelyn would put her head on his chest and he would stroke her shoulder and a brief contentment would envelop them before they drifted off to sleep 8220tell me a story8221 nora said harrison laughed 8220you used to do this all the time8221 8220so i did8221 he let his mind go blank he sat in a rocker opposite and let some seconds pass 8220once i was staying at le concorde in quebec city8221 he said 8220i had a view toward the frontenac down the grandealleacutee between my hotel and the frontenac there were a dozen rooftops all shapes and sizes and on one of these rooftops there were four teenage boys they had brooms and i thought at first they8217d been sent to the roof by maintenance to sweep off the snow but it soon became apparent to me that they were making a hockey rink the prospect of that was horrible you see because there was no guardrail no barrier and if one of the boys bodychecked the other say or if one simply lost his footing he8217d have slipped right off the roof and died presumably the building was at least seven stories up8221 nora tilted her head waiting for more 8220i couldn8217t take my eyes off them8221 harrison said 8220and yet strangely i didn8217t do anything i didn8217t know what the name of the building was and i thought that if i went out onto the street i wouldn8217t be able to see which rooftop it was so i did nothing8221 8220what happened8221 8220nothing8221 nora rested her chin on the back of her hand 8220what else8221 harrison thought a minute 8220before i left to come here8221 he said 8220i watched my wife get dressed for work she had on two different socks one long and one short she hadn8217t shaved her legs8221 8220how did you feel about that8221 8220i was faintly repulsed8221 he admitted 8220i love my wife by the way8221 8220but you see8221 nora said 8220you didn8217t include these facts you edited you would have omitted those details if you8217d been asked to give an account of yourself and then i would have i would have a very different picture of you8221 8220how so8221 8220i now know that you8217re willing to share small secrets you might be a closet coward you probably don8217t like to get too involved you8217re capable of being faintly repulsed by someone you love8221 8220didn8217t you know these things already8221 8220we were children then8221 nora said 8220we8217re we8217re entirely different now8221 are we harrison wondered 8220what8217s that over there8221 he asked pointing 8220that plume of smoke it looks lethal8221 8220a paper bag factory they say it8217s perfectly safe but i don8217t believe it8221 8220quite a forest8221 he said 8220it8217s deceptive you can see only the tops of the trees from here below them there are houses and roads and power lines even a mcdonald8217s8221 8220say it isn8217t so8221 harrison said with mock horror 8220afraid it is there8217s a real forest behind the inn though8221 he craned his neck but the roof blocked any view of the woods behind the inn 8220the inn does well8221 he asked 8220surprisingly it works the way i hoped it would work there are there are always problems8212the toolow toilet seats being the most frequent complaint8221 8220i hadn8217t noticed8221 8220but many of our guests have returned and they8217ve told their friends about it this year we8217re booked through to the end of february8221 8220well done8221 8220i hadn8217t meant to compete it hadn8217t ever really crossed my mind i just wanted something of my own but i am competing with a whole string of b and bs throughout the berkshires8221 8220who makes up your clientele8221 he asked 8220mostly people from boston and new york looking to escape the cities they profess to come for the charm8212a sort of new england charm i find hokey so i don8217t offer it apart from these llbean rockers we8217re sitting on or they come with an ideal of family togetherness that invariably unravels as the weekend progresses8221 8220you sound a bit cynical8221 8220what people really come for is the promise of sex and food and material goods not necessarily in that order the outlets are just ten minutes away8221 8220under all those trees8221 nora nodded 8220i8217m actually hot sitting here8221 harrison said with some surprise 8220take off your sweater8221 8220i think i will if we were primitive people we8217d be frightened by this wouldn8217t we this freakish weather8221 8220the inn was reviewed last year in new york magazine 8221 nora said 8220the reviewer wrote that one could sit on the porch in december he meant sit on the porch in a parka but this year you can do it in shirtsleeves the sun bakes the clapboards8221 8220the lawn is still green8221 he said 8220by this time of year there8217s usually snow on the ground men who haven8217t been on sleds in years like to show off to their wives and children before their knees give out8221 she glanced at her watch 8220i really have to go8221 she said standing 8220i have a rehearsal lunch there8217s another wedding tomorrow agnes and rob should be here by one we8217ll have a private room for the dinner tonight and of course one for tomorrow evening8221 8220is that usual8221 harrison asked 8220to have more than one wedding a weekend8221 8220oh yes8221 nora said 8220i8217ve sometimes had four in a weekend all with rehearsal dinners the trick the trick is to keep the brides from running into one another each wants to think herself unique8221 8220don8217t we all8221 he said nora smiled 8220i thought i might go for a walk8221 he said standing as well 8220i had breakfast on the way here8221 8220good so you8217re all set8221 8220i am8221 nora took a step away from him but then glanced back 8220i suppose someone will mention stephen8221 she asked the name produced in harrison as it always did a clench in his gut along with a slight oil slick of shame he stood still and waited 8220i8217ve been thinking about him a lot8221 nora added harrison was silent 8220do you remember the funeral8221 8220of course8221 he said quietly 8220grief seen up close like that is unbearable it was so much worse than ours so much more intense it made me realize how shallowly we8217d loved him8221 8220perhaps8221 harrison said though at the time his love for his friend had felt intense enough 8220you and i haven8217t spoken to each other since the night of the party8221 nora said 8220no we haven8217t8221 nora looked at him for a moment and he felt her scrutiny 8220i wonder if this wasn8217t a mistake agreeing to have the wedding here8221 she said 8220having you come is a little bit like taking a stick and poking it into a clear pond and watching the mud eddy up into the water8221 8220was the pond so clear before i came8221 he asked 8220it was8221 nora said 8220yes i think it was8221 she turned and harrison watched her walk away along a narrow gravel path that circled around to the front of the inn she moved briskly head down though she must have known he was looking at her and doing so he had a sudden and sharp memory of nora as she had been when he8217d seen her walking along a side street in maine he8217d always remembered where and when he8217d met nora but it had been years since he8217d actually been able to see it as he could now the clarity of the image took his breath away and he thought as he picked up his sweater from the rocker that other such sharp pictures might reveal themselves during the weekend to come for a moment he stood with his hands on his hips and braced himself even as he admired the spectacular view
