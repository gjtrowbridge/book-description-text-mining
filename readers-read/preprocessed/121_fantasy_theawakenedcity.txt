 he wore lightshimmering veils and coils of it moving around him as he walked it was not the natural radiance of his flesh which only he could see but illusion shaped from the substance of the air beneath it he was as he had first come to them naked but for a breechclout and the cloak of his long black hair it was cold in the passagethe cold of rock of deep subterranean placesand his body was tense with chill a heavy golden chain lay around his neck from it cased in gold hung an ambercolored crystal larger than a man8217s clenched fist with a heart of flame the passage kinked he could hear the crowda rushing sound that reminded him briefly of the hiss of wind across the meadows of his lost home ahead a slash of brightness split the passage8217s black he increased his pace launching himself into the illumination as if into water below on the tumbled and stalagmited floor of a deep cavern his faithful massed more than a thousand strong to his shaper senses they were not just a throng of men and women but a roiling play of color and light stippled here and there with the ordinary flame of torches at the sight of him they roared he stood above them on the ledge he had made his radiant arms spread wide their adulation pouring like sunlight into the dark void at his center he was warm now warm as the heatpatterns the torches printed on the substance of the air he threw back his head and laughed 8220people8221 he shouted the natural acoustics of the cavern sent his voice pealing out above the clamor 8220people of the promise8221 8220fulfiller of the promise8221 they shouted back 8220he who opens the way8221 8220people of the new age8221 8220guardian of interim who speaks the word of the risen god8221 8220people of acircrata8221 8220beloved of acircrata who sets our feet upon the waking road8221 he was not certain when these phrases had become invariable in the beginning his calls and their responses had altered with each ceremony but now the cadences were constant as if this were a true religious rite and not the basest and most final blasphemy he gathered himself and leaped outward into nothingness focusing his will upon the air below his feet so that it grew slow and thick allowing him to drift leaflike to the cavern8217s floor unlike the illusory brilliance in which he was clad this was real shaping accompanied by the flash and thunder all transformation made but to his followers who because of the strange proscriptions of this world had never witnessed unfettered shaping his descent was not the exercise of a human power but a miracle he allowed his shimmering attire to billow as he fell so they might glimpse his body he knew that that he was beautiful to both men and women and that for many faith was most urgent when it was bound to carnal longing he alighted gently on the broken rock before him his followers were a scintillating wallmen and women and children young and middleaged and elderly individuals and couples and even families there were soldiers here and blacksmiths and seamstresses and prostitutes there were people who had given up their wealth to join him and people who had owned nothing to sacrifice there were those who had passed all their lives in virtue and those who had followed the most violent of criminal pursuits yet in this place in this moment they were all alike for they were all his creaturesstolen souls every one of them blackened past any point of cleansing with the blasphemy into which he had enticed them the wonder and dread and desire in their faces seemed to flow from a single heart he stepped toward them they parted like grass those closest to him sinking to their knees slowly he walked among them his hands held before him palms out so they could see the terrible scars the blood of acircrata had inflicted when he brought it out of the burning land they were allowed to touch his wounds if they dared and many did quick featherbrushes of finger on finger palm on palmand occasionally a brief warm shock on ankle or hip or shoulder as those driven by greater courage or greater need sought a more intimate contact it had taken an act of will in the beginning to endure it but over time it had become part of the larger thing he had learned to crave their awe their adoration which for a little while filled up the emptiness in him where those same passions once had lived 8220messenger8221 they sighed 8220beloved one most beautiful8221 he made a single circuit of the cavern then he left them for the heights above thickening the air before him to make a kind of invisible stairway he could climb this was far more difficult than the trick he had performed to descendbeyond the capacity of most shapers in factbut to his huge gift it was nothing on the overhang again he turned toward the faithful they respondednot a roar this time but a rumble a mutter which was somehow more powerful than the greater noise he imagined he could feel it under his bare feet 8220people of the promise8221 8220beloved one8221 many held up their palms showing him the proof of their faith 8220child of acircrata8221 8220you who have gathered here in acircrata8217s name you who have woken to the truth you who in understanding have chosen me and thus become my father8217s chosen look upon the sign my father has given the sign of his rising the sign of his will the sign that his ageold promise soon will be fulfilled8221 with his hands he swept aside the wreathing brilliance at his breast revealing the great crystal in its setting of gold not one part of what he said to them was true not what he claimed to be not what he urged them to believe not what he pledged for the time to come but the crystal was real he had taken it himself from the cavern of the blood where acircrata had slept the eons away and now slept no more its realness was the reason he could lie 8220it is my task to bear this blood and my father8217s will into a world that does not yet know me8221 the hugeness of the falsehood shook him the completeness of the blasphemy 8220it is your task also you citizens of this holy community this awakened city with me you will open the way for acircrata8217s return and bring an end to the age of exile8221 8220 acircrata8221 they chanted 8220acircrata who slept acircrata who has risen acircrata who will return8221 8220abide now with me in anticipation of the fulfillment of this sacred purpose abide in expectation of the sign that will reveal the predestined moment of our emergence abide in eagerness for the work that we will do when we march upon the lands beyond these mountains and to their ignorance and corruption shout the truth we knowthat acircrata has risen that the time of cleansing is at hand when all will be seared clean in the god8217s holy fires that the primal age approaches and soon will reign anew8221 8220in faith we abide in love we abide in strength we abide8221 8220i give you blessing now in my name and in my father8217s name and in the name of the time to come in my name in my father8217s name in the name of the time to come i bid you go in light8221 he flung up his glowing arms a flash a pulse of sound and from the air above the crowd burst a rain of gold they shouted jumping shoving one another snatching at the treasure he had early realized the importance of providing them with items they could keep and hold in counterpoint to the intangibles of faith he gave them something with every ceremony jewels or crystals or nuggets of precious metal many had substantial hoards of these trinkets which they treated as holy talismans fools he thought looking down at them i can say anything and they will believe i can order anything and they will obey the familiar dark thrill of it ran through him and he shuddered with his shaping he controlled the elements the very framework of reality with his voice and his person he commanded souls were those not the powers of a god he left them passing once more into the pitchy darkness of the passage he abandoned the illusion that clothed him the gaudy trappings of the role he played and strode through the mountain8217s heart with only the light of his own life to guide him and on his chest the trembling fire of acircrata8217s blood in his private domain a succession of caverooms that he had shaped and altered in very particular ways he sought the third chamber where a circular well was punched into the floor he had shaped it full of water before the ceremony now he caused the water8217s patterns to dance with heat so that steam billowed toward the ceiling he removed the chain that held the blood and laid it on the floorgently for in spite of everything he could not quite break himself of the habit of reverence he unwound his breechclout and slid into the warmth sighing he lay with his eyes closed his long hair coiling round him like a shadowmemory of the light he had worn the last of the ceremony8217s exaltation slipped away and the residue of his followers all the hundreds of little touches they had pressed into his skin leaving him clean leaving him empty the hush of his quarters settled around himthe quiet of the deep spaces inside the rock and behind it a greater silence he could speak or cough or roil the water and the mountain8217s quiet would be banished the other silence was beyond his power to break the shouting of his followers filled it but only briefly he remained in the water until the balance began to tip the relief of his aloneness eclipsed by the discomfort of it he hated being alone in some ways it was the most difficult part of his charade to be pulled always between his contempt for the creatures who surrounded him whose adulation he had grown to crave but could not endure for long and his horror of solitude he climbed from his bath and walked dripping to his bedchamber where he pulled on his clothes clumsy with his ruined hands he made as much noise as possible but he could still sense the silence waiting underneath it will be different soon he told himself an end to loneliness it was a hope not a certainty in the old days he would have prayed these days he had only himself to rely on and knew it had always been so even when he had believed in a listening god he tightened his belt and stamped into his boots nomadmade their toes shod with silver and left his quarters to walk the blind inner spaces of the mountain and fill them with the light and tumult of his power shattering the silence until he grew tired enough to sleep
