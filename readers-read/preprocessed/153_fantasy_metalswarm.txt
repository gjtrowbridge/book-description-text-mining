 an unending swarm of giant beetlelike klikiss poured through the transportal on llaro for days marching from some unknown distant planet during the initial panic mayor ruis and the roamer spokesman roberto clarin had issued a futile appeal for calm among the people there was nothing more they could do with the klikiss controlling the transportal the colonists had no way to leave llaro they were trapped the horror and shock gradually dulled to hopelessness and confusion at least the creatures hadnt killed anyone yet alone on a barren hill orli covitz stood looking toward the termitemound ruins and the colony settlement thousands of intelligent bugs moved over the landscape investigating everything with relentless alien curiosity no one understood what the klikiss wanted151with the exception perhaps of the strangely haunted margaret colicos the longlost xenoarchaeologist who had spent years among them presently the fifteenyearold girl saw margaret trudging up the hill toward her accompanied by dd the friendly compy who had taken a liking to orli almost as soon as he arrived with margaret through the transportal the older woman wore the field jumpsuit of a xenoarchaeologist its fabric and fastenings designed to last for years under tough conditions in the field though by now it was tattered and stained dd walked cheerfully up to orli he studied her expression you appear to be sad orli covitz my planets being invaded dd just look at them thousands and thousands we cant live here with them and we cant get off the planet margaret colicos has lived among the klikiss for a considerable time she is still alive and healthy breathing heavily in the dry air margaret stopped beside the two physically healthy maybe but you may want to reserve judgment as to my psychological health the distant shattered gaze of the older woman discomfited orli she didnt want to imagine what margaret must have endured among the giant insects i am still getting used to talking with other people again so my social skills may be somewhat lacking i spent so long trying to think like the klikiss it was very draining she placed her hand on the compys shoulder i really thought i might go mad until dd arrived the compy didnt seem aware of any sort of threat around them but were back now margaret colicos and safe among friends safe orli didnt know if she would ever feel entirely safe again not long after she and her father had left dreary dremen to become colonists on corribus black robots had wiped out the settlement leaving only orli and mr steinman alive to make a new start she had come to llaro and now the klikiss had invaded dds optimism was unrelenting margaret understands the klikiss she will explain them to the colonists and show you how to live together wont you margaret even the older woman had a skeptical expression on her face dd i barely understand how i survived though my years of training as a xenoarchaeologist should count for something orli reached out and took her calloused hand then you have to tell mayor ruis and roberto clarin what you know dd dutifully took her other hand knowledge is helpful isnt it margaret yes dd knowledge is a tool ill explain what i learned and hope it turns out to be useful as they descended the hill toward the town they walked directly past several spiny klikiss warriors and a troop of mottled yellowandblack builders that had begun to dig long trenches disregarding any boundaries the colonists had marked anxious orli held the womans hand tightly margaret was unruffled though she paid no more attention to the individual klikiss than the creatures seemed to pay her why are there so many types of klikiss theyve all got different colors and markings orli had even seen some with almost human heads and faces like hard masks though most just looked like bugs klikiss dont have sexes they have subbreeds the large spiny ones are warriors to fight in the many hive wars others are gatherers builders scouts scientists you cant be serious those bugs have scientists and mathematicians and engineers margaret raised her eyebrows with a certain measure of admiration they discovered the transportal technology after all they invented the klikiss torch and left detailed records and intricate equations on the walls of their ruins those creatures solve problems through brute force151and they do it well orli watched the swarming klikiss whose clustered towerlike structures looked like a giant hive complex do they have a queen margaret stared with unfocused eyes as if buried in unforgettable nightmares not a queen151a breedex neither male nor female it is the mind and soul of the hive orli drew the womans attention back to the real question but what do they want margaret remained quiet for so long that orli thought she hadnt heard then the archaeologist said everything most of the klikiss had moved back into their ancient city as if nothing had changed in millennia one huge klikiss with a silvery exoskeleton adorned with black tiger stripes had an extra pair of segmented legs a carapace full of spikes and polished knobs and several sets of faceted eyes its headface was ovoid composed of many small plates that shifted and moved almost giving it expressions this one seemed much vaster somehow more important and ominous than the others orli stared her eyes wide that is one of the eight domates that attend the breedex margaret said they provide additional genetic material necessary for spreading the hive will i see the breedex myself the older woman flinched hope you do not it is very risky did you ever see her151it i mean many times it is how i survived she offered nothing more so it cant be that risky it is they passed by edf barracks built among the alien towers the soldiers were pale and frightened their uniforms rumpled and stained these eddies151stationed here with instructions to protect the colonists and guard the transportal so the roamer detainees didnt escape151could now do little more than watch the invasion as helpless as the colonists they were supposed to safeguard orli was surprised to see that the klikiss had not disarmed the troops why do the soldiers still have their guns the klikiss dont care without asking permission or making any gesture to acknowledge what they were doing the klikiss workers began to tear down the modular barracks ripping open the walls with their armored claws the edgy edf soldiers began shouting wait a minute some of them pushed forward at least let us get our stuff out first the bustling insects diligently continued their tasks paying no more attention to the distraught men than they would to ornamental rocks bolstered by their fellows several soldiers ran toward the barracks stop hold on klikiss workers tore one section into scrap metal strewing dismantled bunks storage units clothing and supplies around like garbage the nearest edf soldier got in the way of an insectile demolitionist and raised his pulse jazer rifle back off bugs im warning you151 the klikiss swung a segmented limb decapitated the man and returned to its labors before the corpse fell to the ground outraged nine uniformed soldiers screamed took aim with their highpowered rifles and started shooting margaret groaned and squeezed her eyes shut this will turn out badly isnt there something you can do orli cried not a thing as projectiles slammed into them the insect creatures didnt comprehend what was happening despite the weapons fire cutting them down workers continued to destroy lockers full of clothing equipment scrapbooks of friends and family edf weapons splattered eleven of the insect workers before the rest of the subhive turned on the soldiers dozens of spiny warriors marched up while the soldiers kept firing until their weapons were empty then the klikiss killed them orli stared at the bloodshed speechless even dd seemed alarmed a troop of workers arrived to replace the dead insects and others hauled the human and klikiss bodies away a tigerstriped domate strode up to margaret and spoke in a clattering language margaret made a clicking unnatural sound in her throat while dd translated for orli the domate says those newbreeds are defective they have been eliminated from the gene pool it turned away as a new troop of workers continued the demolition of the barracks in order to build their own structures theyre going to kill us all arent they orli asked with grim resignation the klikiss arent here for you margaret narrowed her eyes staring at the ancient structure that housed the transportal i learned something very important when i deciphered their language their primary enemies are the black robots the klikiss mean to wipe them out all of the robots just dont get in the way
