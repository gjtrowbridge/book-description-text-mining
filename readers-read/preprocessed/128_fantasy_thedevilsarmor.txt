 chapter onethe fall king lorn the wicked knew the knives were out in the past daysdays he knew were the last of his kingshipconspiracies were everywhere with no one to be trusted it was the reward for a life lived in treachery where alliances shifted like sand in the storms kicked up by war it was how jazana carr wanted him to endalone and afraid tonight darkness fell heavy on carlion soldiers milled about the castle courtyard and its many towers keeping an uneasy eye on their foes in the distant hills clouds obscured the moonlight an abrasive breeze stirred lorns cape he drew his wolffur collar closer to his face and squinted against the dust and sand filth that constantly tumbled through the streets of his capital out of the crumbling mountains from atop the wallwalk king lorn could see for miles the turrets of carlion provided an excellent vantage against invaders as he had for the past three nights he watched as rihards forces waited in the hills their many torches glowing defiantly announcing their numbers they had not yet advanced on carlion but lorn and his men knew time was short perhaps the duke awaited more of jazana carrs mercenaries to bolster his own forces from rolga perhaps the siege would start at dawn or perhaps they were waiting for one more traitor to make a move king lorns mind turned on this as he stared into the hills there was work to be done tonight and he had very little time if he was to escape this trap he needed to be sharp jazana carr was clever the bitchqueen from hanging man had held his stones in a vice for months now one by one she had coopted his barons cooing to them with her endless supply of diamonds lorn wondered how much rihards had cost to turn not long ago he and the duke had been close allies they had even been friends though lorn had always used that term carefully as he stared out into the hills counting up the torches of rihards massed army he was sorry the duke had betrayed him yet in an odd way he was also glad it had opened his eyes to treachery he turned away from the hills just for a moment and looked down at his soldiers twenty feet below the main gate of carlion stood in rocksolid defiance to the army in the hills fortified with stout beams and fighting men with bows and lances among these men stood jarrin his captainatarms and garrison commander jarrin was pensive as he milled about his troops in his distinctive armor his head toped by a falconfaced helmet with a crest of dangling feathers few of the men wore their helmets down lorn noticed not so with jarrin afraid to show your face lorns gaze lingered on his captain it was he who had brought jazana carrs letter to the castle he who duke rihards had summoned forth and it was he who had agreed to the dangerous mission almost without pause jarrin had always been a brave man for a moment lorn felt puzzled he looked away from the captain up over the castle toward the city beyond his capital was bleak blackedout by fear of the coming invasion there were no peasants or drunks in the streets no watchful citizens waiting to defend their city they were all barricaded into their shabby homes totally unwilling to bolster their king once a very long time ago the city had been a jewel now it had been bled dry a necessary evil of civil war lorn grunted as he looked at his city deciding its fate wasnt his fault quotmy lord is troubledquot came a voice lorn turned to see his manservant uralak crossing the wallwalk toward him uralak wore a doublet and chainmail shirt both too large for his slight frame his was an older slender man who was not much lorns senior years of hard work had roughened his hands and face like all those who had remained in carlion uralak had prepared himself for battle though lorn doubted he would last more than a few moments in combat he was a good man one of the few whose loyalty lorn never doubted quotyou should go inside my lordquot said uralak keeping his voice low quotit does none of us good to see you brooding herequot king lorn kept his eyes on the capital the city he was sworn to protect such was the weight of his kingship it was a promise he had kept for almost two decades mostly quotthey have never loved mequot he said with a deep breath he took note again of the citys darkness quotlook they do not even come to offer arms or comfort not one kind word has come from themquot quotthey are afraid my lordquot said uralak he did not argue lorns point of being unloved the manservant clenched his collar around his neck and turned to look out over the hills quotyou were right my lord duke rihards is a patient manquot his old eyes narrowed on the numerous pinpoints of torchlight quotand persuasive his men follow him willingly in this treasonquot quotrihards has a potent tonguequot lorn agreed his old ally the duke had come from rolga with a robust army spurred by jazana carrs promise of wealth the diamond queen as she called herself had thusly persuaded many of norvors fractured barons to join her she had done what lorn himself had never been able to do bringing a kind of tyrannical peace to northern norvor she seemed to have all the wealth of the world at her pretty fingertips quoti should have killed him the last time he was herequot lamented lorn recalling rihards last visit to carlion it was hardly a month ago when the two had planned their defense against jazana carrs coming mercenaries quotdo you think he knew then uralak was he laughing at me while we drank our winequot quotwho can say my lordquot the old mans face tightened quotwe are strong we will resist themquot lorn leaned out over the wall walk wrapping his hands over the castles pitted stone he ached to speak the truth to uralakto anyone reallybut knew he could not for a moment he wished rinka was with him and that he could lay just one more time in her loving arms but his third wife was dead and as cold as the mountains leaving him an infant daughter to protect rinka had died with screams in her throat on nights like this it seemed to lorn that he could still hear her cries echoing through carlions battered halls bloody and exhausted as she pushed their daughter from her womb quotand now that bitch wants to take my daughter away from mequot spat lorn it was jazana carrs final insult to him delivered by a man he had once trusted in her letter she had described her wretched plan to kill every man in carlion but to raise lorns daughter as her own and what was he to do kill his own child he had considered it it might have been worth it to keep poppy from falling into the bitchqueens care but lorn had a better idea quotwe will protect poppy my lordquot uralak assured him quotall of us we wont let her be takenquot the king of norvor troubled and weary from what seemed like a lifetime of fighting looked at the man who had been his servant for years quotthat wont be enough uralakquot he studied him astounded by his ignorance quotyou do know that dont you duke rihards has ruined us when they come they will kill usquot uralak stiffened quotno i dont know thatquot he set his jaw a little higher looking at the hills but not really seeing them quotand the men dont know that either my lord they are with youquot king lorn the wicked needed to say no more there had never been any question of uralaks fealty like most of the castles servants the old man had been born and bred to it there was no treachery in his profession soldiers however were a different matter lorns gaze flittered down once again toward jarrin who was walking aimlessly through the men of his garrison giving orders that didnt need giving quoturalak keep an eye on things for me herequot said lorn quotim tired im going to my chambers in an hour send jarrin up to see mequot quotyes my lordquot lorn picked his way along the wallwalk climbed down a ladder leading to the courtyard and gave the main gate of his castle fortress a cursory inspection the garrison soldiers stayed silent looking at their king with gaunt expressions they had suffered for him and he knew it if he hadnt been so afraid of treachery he might have appreciated it instead he crossed the courtyard without a word making his way to the tower where his chambers were where his infant daughter was asleep they had made love in a poppy field running through it like children then laying down in the red flowers to satisfy their lust and when rinka had realized she was with child and had traced it back to that romantic day she had proclaimed that any girl child from their lovemaking would be named poppy so that she could remember that time when she was so happy on that day war had seemed such a distant thing though it raged all around them they were lost in love and in their arms had forgotten the diamond queen and her minions and the noose closing around carlion lorn was many years rinkas elder and had already gone through two wives before marrying his latest youngest bride the first he had put away for being barren the second he had lost to a lung cough that one had been a good breeder and had given the king three fine sons all of whom had ridden off to war and all of whom were dead edvar his youngest had served with duke rihards only a week ago had his head arrived in a basket king lorn thought of all these things in the quiet of his chamber as he studied his daughters tiny sleeping face he always kept her very near a constant reminder of the young wife he had lost sixmonth old poppy slept in a crib away from the window lorn himself reclined in a hard wooden chair beside the crib his troubled mind reviewed his plan but the sight of his daughter was a constant distraction of all things lorn had never imagined himself taking a woman in a field of flowers he was well into his fifties now and thought he had abandoned such notions forever but rinka had rekindled something in him it was amazing how virile she made him and because he had so little to give because he was a pauper king who had spent all his pennies in defense of carlion he knew that she did not love him for his wealth or the promise of a richer tomorrow rinka was a smart woman wise enough to know that jazana carr could not be stopped it was rinka who had prophesized a year or less till their demise had she lived she would have predicted rihards treachery lorn was sure she was clairvoyant that way and he missed her she was the only woman he had ever really valued and that was whyperhaps the only reasonhe would do anything to save their daughter quotjazana carr thinks us fools childquot he whispered quotshe wants to raise you as her own an insult to my eternal memory would you want that to be covered in diamonds and to be a whore like herquot the infant did not respond lorn wasnt even sure she could hear him time would tell but she might well be as deaf as she was blind on a table nearby stood a decanter of wine and two crystal goblets among the best glassware the castle still could offer most things of value had been sold off long ago both goblets were empty awaiting jarrins arrival next to the wine decanter was jazana carrs letter written in her own offending hand lorns gaze moved from his daughter to the ugly note she scorns me it was not enough that she should announce herself the savior of norvan womanhood or that she sought his kingdom and castle she would take everything from me so like a woman lorn was about to tell his sleeping daughter this when a knock came to his chamber door in the nearperfect silence the sound startled him he sat up his stronglyfeatured face creasing quotenterquot jarrin his captainatarms and commander of the dwindling garrison at carlion pushed open the door and waited in the threshold he was in impressive man in his armor wide and forbidding he held his helmet in the crux of his arm the first time he had removed it in many hours his divested head shone in the torchlight of the hall cleanly shaven to a bald shine quotmy liegequot he said bowing quoturalak told me you wish to see mequot quotyesquot replied lorn though it wasnt quite correct he detested jarrin now and would have preferred the company of just about anyone else quotcome in i want to speak to youquot suspicion flashed through jarrins eyes he covered it by feigning exhaustion sighing and saying quotforgive me my liege i am very tiredquot as he noted the wine decanter he added quoti may not be proper company tonightquot quotcome in and be quietquot said lorn gesturing toward his daughter quotshes asleepquot jarrin did as his king requested entering the room as quietly as his bulky armor would allow and coming to stand before the sitting lorn the king pointed to the opposite chair quotsitquot the captain did so looking uncomfortable lorn ignored this as he poured oxblood wine into the twin goblets quotwe need to speak my friendquot said lorn quottheres not much time and i needed to get you away from curious earsquot he pushed one of the goblets across the table toward jarrin avoiding the carefully folded letter laying between them it seemed to lorn that his captain was making every effort to avoid glancing at the note with a gauntleted fist jarrin took the goblet but did not drink quotmy liege i should return to my postquot said jarrin quotif the duke attacksquot quotif the duke attacks he will run us down like dead grassquot lorn smiled and lifted his goblet in toast quotto tomorrow then and our deathsquot returning the smile jarrin said quotno we are strong my liege we will repel themquot quotah you dont think that jarrin youre not as stupid as uralak you know the truthquot lorn raised his eyebrows quotdont youquot jarrin hesitated quoti will admit our task is great quot he went no further lorn leaned back in his chair with his goblet cradled in his long fingers he contemplated his captain quotwell perhaps you are rightquot he said quotperhaps jazana carr hasnt been able to buy as much loyalty as ive feared or maybe duke rihards will have a change of heart hmm do you think he will renounce the bitchqueen for the sake of old friendshipsquot quoti cannot say my liegequot at last jarrin drank hiding his face behind the goblet quotnoquot lorn agreed quotwho can read the heart of a traitorquot before the awkward silence grew too long lorn put down his goblet quotlook at thatquot he said pointing with his chin toward jazana carrs letter quota bold woman that onequot jarrin nodded quoti wish i had never laid eyes on itquot quotwhat choice had you my friend duke rihards called you forth and i needed carrs message it was brave of you have no regretsquot for the first time since hed brought the letter into carlion jarrin looked remorseful quothave you read it my liegequot quotof course i havequot lorn snapped then he remembered that jarrin probably had not quotgo on read it yourself if you likequot quotnoquot said jarrin quoti dont care toquot with a flick of a finger lorn nudged the note closer to jarrin quotshe calls me a tyrant she thinks her reign would be better than mine i suspect some in the city think that as wellquot quotits been hard for the people my liegequot replied jarrin he was a proud man it didnt surprise lorn that he was rising to the bait quottheyve endured hardships for you they want only to see an end to things to have bread againquot quotthen they can blame jazana carr for thatquot in his anger lorn almost crushed the stem of his goblet he glanced toward the still sleeping poppy lowering his voice with effort quotalmost twenty years jarrin do i have to remind everyone of that it could have been twenty years of peace for us all if not for that ambitious bitch if the people blame me for this war then i say let them call me wickedquot he sat back brooding over his wine wanting to smash the goblet against the wall there had been no way for him to make peace and no other country had come to aid him but his people stupid mindless sheep had never seen that quoti get blamed for infants dying for mothers having no milk for crops withering for blight of every kind is that how theyll remember mequot quotthey will welcome an end to war when it comesquot said jarrin quotthey will celebrate my deathquot quotno my liegequot quotno because i will not let themquot lorn smiled sharply at his captain quoti will not die jarrin not tonightquot again the silence rose between them lorn watched jarrins expression the moment stretched like syrup and then he saw it just for a moment just a hint and he knew that he was right about his trusted aide before the hint could flee he seized it quothow much did she buy you forquot jarrin knew in an instant hed been discovered his hand shot toward his dagger but lorn was ready grasping the table and tossing it over smashing it against jarrin like a shield the decanter and goblets flew through the air as jarrin tumbled backward his armor unbalancing him quickly lorn released his own blade a narrow stiletto pinned beneath his cape the weapon leapt forward as lorn pursued jarrin over the table landing on him like a jaguar jarrins head collided with the floor his arms flailing uselessly lorn dropped his weight down upon his quarry buckling jarrins breastplate and knocking the air from his lungs clasping his fists together he hammered jarrins jaw snapping it the young captain wailed in pain too slow to react his eyes widened horribly as he felt lorns stiletto at his throat quoti know she paid youquot panted lorn he was a big man and easily held down the stunned jarrin straddling his midsection while the stiletto hovered threateningly with one push he could puncture the gorget quothow much i wanted to believe you hadnt betrayed mequot lorn hissed quotbut youre like rihards and the others you love only moneyquot jarrin tried to speak but his fractured jaw garbled his words quotbutcherquot came the cry spit out with blood and saliva lorn lifted jarrins bald head and slammed it into the stone floor jarrins eyes fluttered wildly seeing his captain still awake lorn roared and hammered a fist into his temple the stilettos pommel broke bone and skin jarrin drifted into unconsciousness lorn leaned back exhausted he closed his eyes and caught his breath straddling his neardead captain poppy was crying inadvertently they had struck her crib knocking it aside lorns eyes shot to the door he had left strict orders not to be disturbed but lariza was like a second mother to the child and always ignored lorns gruff commands hurriedly he rose and went to the door opening it not surprisingly he saw the nursemaid coming down the hall the young woman stopped when she saw the king quoti heard the child my lordquot she said trying to look past him quotis she all rightquot quotshes finequot lorn hardened his expression quotand i knew youd be on your way what did i tell you woman im not to be disturbedquot quotyes my lord butquot quotgoquot ordered lorn quotim with captain jarrinquot quotthen let me look after poppy quot quotaway womanquot barked lorn pointing down the hall quotnowquot swallowing her anger lariza spun and huffed down the hallway her skirt billowing behind her lorn cursed under his breath and closed the door poppy was still crying in her crib lorn ignored her going straight to the unconscious jarrin stupidly he had left his stiletto on the floor beside him he picked it up then noticed jarrins own dagger strewn across the floor its blade was flat like a carving knife a better tool for the work at hand lorn picked it up tested its edge with his thumb and decided it was perfect deciding there was no turning back he bent over jarrin and pried open his mouth inside was his unmoving tongue lorn took the tongue in his left hand and pulled with his right he worked the dagger slicing off the tongue like bacon blood sluiced from jarrins mouth amazingly he did not awaken he was a dead man anyway lorn knew and sat back with satisfaction the pink muscle from jarrins mouth bloody in his palm time was his enemy lorn rose and walked across the chamber to his dressing area where a basin of water stood below a mirror a small bale of white cloth rested on the dressing table carefully lorn wrapped jarrins tongue in some of the cloth then placed it on the table he dipped the bloody dagger into the basin of water rinsing off the gore then went to work on himself carefully shaving his head shedding saltandpepper hair at his feet after a few minutes he was done and stared at his bald reflection in the wavy mirror his eyes were nearly the same color as jarrins he noted with satisfaction while his daughter poppy continued to cry king lorn the wicked shook the blade in the water once more then began shaving his beard at the foot of a small dentate mountain range duke rihards of rolga waited impatiently atop his armored horse eager for a sign of success around him were a handful of his loyal knights men of his own country who had accompanied him from rolga to lead the assault on carlion he had come with an impressive force of a thousand men a mix of rolgans and mercenaries from jazana carrs conquered territories men who were well paid for their loyalty to the diamond queen after years of resistance duke rihards had finally joined the ranks of jazana carrs whores he was not proud of himself a man of few friends the duke had counted king lorn among them but war and jazana carrs wealth had conspired to change that the duke looked out across the craggy plain toward carlion the fortress lit with torchlight as its defenders awaited their fate according to jarrin there were still two hundred men in the garrison rihards could barely believe king lorn the wicked had held the loyalty of so many in the face of certain death he had a strange and ruthless glamour rihards smiled a little a breeze blew across the plain making him shiver in the moonlight his men looked like ghosts their polished armor dully gleaming behind him in the foothills his mercenary force laughed and ate and sharpened their pikes sure of the coming victory they were northerners mostly from places far more north than rolga from the bleak territories where jazana carr was most powerful duke rihards suppressed a sigh as he spied carlion looking so forlorn in the clouded night all across norvor jazana carrs forces were tightening the noose in vicvar and poolv the dukes of those southern cities were gasping their last rihards himself could have easily been among them and he wondered now if he should have stayed loyal and died with honor like those brave fools quotah but she pays you seequot he whispered a knight of his cavalry heard his lament and turned his helmeted heard toward the duke quotmy lordquot duke rihards slowly shook his head quotnothing glane i was just thinkingquot he said he did not trust his men enough to share his melancholy he was a turncoat and could trust no one these days thats what jazana carr had made of him its what she made of all norvan men lapdogs to perform for her rihards ground his jaws together knowing the misery of being gelded for more than an hour he sat atop his horse refusing to move or rejoin the rest of his troops even when glane suggested he rest it was very late they had plans to attack in the morning with or without jarrins success but jarrins plan would make everything so much easier and rihards could not bring himself to rest or to eat until he knew of jarrins progress he had already told the captain of lorns secret escape route a hidden collection of doors and tunnels the king had revealed one night in a drunken stupor jarrin had said he knew of the route but had never seen it because it was part of the kings private chambers which consisted of an entire wing of carlion castle so far though captain jarrin had not appeared the duke of rolga began to fret lorn was a resourceful man perhaps he had discovered his captains plan perhaps they would need to battle the king after all then like an angel from heaven a lone rider appeared out of the misty moonlight galloping away from carlion across the rocky plain toward duke rihards and his waiting army the knights surrounding the duke noticed the rider at once and began murmuring excitedly the rider was a wide man barrelchested and wearing royal armor as he drew closer his helmet could be seen forged into the likeness of a bird duke rihards was overwhelmed with relief not wanting his army to see what was about to happen he snapped the reins of his patient stallion and rode forward to meet jarrin calling to his knights quotridequot he commanded them and the five cavalrymen followed leaving behind the safeness of their army and entering the bleak flatland rihards rode at the forefront keeping a watchful eye on jarrin the captain seemed to slump in his saddle in his arms was a bundle of cloth sighting the parcel brought a grin to the dukes face amazingly jarrin had succeeded as he drew closer his wishes were confirmed the thing in jarrins arms was indeed a baby but jarrin himself looked horribly wounded blood trailed down from beneath his closed helm soaking his breast plate he looked on the verge of collapse teetering in his saddle finally he stopped riding and waited for rihards and his men the rolgan duke reined in his horse halting his company a pace from the wounded captain who sat seething on his mount bloodied and battered his breath rasping beneath his iron helmet the crying child of king lorn in his left arm suddenly he let out an angry grunt and with his right arm tossed something pink into the sand between them quotwhat the quot rihards grimaced as he studied the bloodied thing he looked up at jarrin quotwhat the hell is thatquot the captain shook his fist in rage then tilted up the visor of his helmet stuffed into his mouth was a wad of bloodied cloth holding back the worst of the gore like a stopper rihards reared back confused and disgusted then shocked when he realized the pink thing in the sand was jarrins tongue he could barely see the captains face for the blood jarrin pointed down at his tongue cursing in angry squeals quothe cut out your tonguequot rihards deduced aloud quotwhyquot of course jarrin couldnt answer all he could do was rage and wince in pain quotbut you have the childquot said rihards quotwhat of lorn did you kill himquot jarrin nodded he held the baby jealously against his bloodied breast and when rihards trotted closer he slammed down his visor and roared his anger quotwe had a bargain captain jarrin give me the child i will see that jazana carr pays you your doquot jarrin shook his head wildly again he grunted his curses the way he held the child explained his meaning perfectly quotall right then deliver the child yourselfquot rihards said quotjazana carr is in the hills near harn my men will take you to herquot he ordered glane and two of his other knights to take jarrin to the diamond queen it didnt concern him at all if the captain bled to death on the way he had killed lorn and stolen his child and that was all that mattered quotyouve done well captain jarrinquot he said quotwithout your king carlion should fall in a dayquot jarrin tried to speak then stopped rihards supposed his pain was enormous quotgoquot said the duke quotits a full days ride to harn at least you may rest first with my men if you wish we have a surgeon who can look at you quot shaking his head the captain steadied himself in his saddle then rode off heading northwest toward harn with the child in his arms when he gone only a few yards he looked back at the knights who were to accompany him as if to ask why they were dawdling quotgo with himquot ordered rihards quotsee that he gets his money from jazana carr hes brave enough to deserve his payquot glane the dukes lieutenant nodded taking two of his fellows with him they started off after jarrin who immediately took to riding again obviously in a great hurry to get paid as rihards watched him go he felt a twinge of regret he knew that the child would be well taken care of by jazana carr so that didnt worry him any child the diamond queen encountered was well treated so long as it was a girl child but the death of king lorn bothered the duke for a moment he thought of all the good times theyd had together the fine wines and stories they had shared and all those dreams they had voiced about defeating jazana carr but then he thought of conquering carlion and how he would be rewarded for the deed he thought also about lorns jeweled ring and how his old friend had kept it hidden in a chest within his private wing afraid to wear it for fear of theft in these dark days and when rihards thought of the ringwhich he had always covetedhis feelings of remorse abruptly fled two hours before sunrise uralak went in search of his master king lorn the old manservant was concerned that he hadnt seen his king for some hours not since hed retired to his chambers when it occurred to uralak that he had not seen captain jarrin either he began to worry up until then he had stayed with the soldiers of the garrison guarding the main gate and watching the forces of duke rihards in the far far distance because it was too dark to see anything the guardians were uneasy uralak shared their fears but did not voice them though he was old and only a manservant he would die with a smile on his face leaving the place he had come to call his post uralak went through the silent courtyard and entered the halls of carlion which were empty now of women and children and rang with his footfalls as he shuffled along pensive he remembered his prior conversation with his king and how his master had seemed so forlorn sure that their cause was hopeless there were not many in carlion who loved king lorn but uralak counted himself among the handful there was nothing he would not do for his king no secret he would not keep as he walked through the castle he kept his suspicions to himself because king lorns chambers were in the tallest of carlions towers it took uralak long minutes to reach them when he did he was exhausted from the climb he found the area of the kings chambers empty those servants who hadnt fled the castle had long ago gone to sleep carefully he made his way through the darkened hall he didnt expect to be startled but when he rounded a familiar bend a figure frightened him it was lariza the nursemaid to the kings daughter she was outside the kings chamber door listening angrily uralak cleared his throat quotwhat are you doingquot he whispered lariza straightened indignantly quotim worried about poppy the king is in there with her but i havent heard a sound from them in hours and i didnt see captain jarrin leave eitherquot uralak nodded as if nothing were wrong quotdid the king tell you to disturb himquot quotof course notquot replied lariza sourly quotright so why dont you stop meddling woman and be on your way ill look after the king go nowquot the nursemaid started to protest than decided not to be quarrelsome she said only quotmake sure the child is all right old manquot then turned and departed uralak waited until she was well out of sight around the bend then followed her a bit to make sure she was truly gone before doubling back lariza was rightthe kings chambers were strangely soundless once more he contemplated the dark possibilities he drew a deep breath to steady himself then knocked on the door quotmy lordquot he queried quotits uralak forgive the disturbance please but i thought i should check on youquot there was no reply hoping the king was sleeping he pushed open the door and peered inside quotmy lordquot except for the moonlight from the unshuttered windows the vast chamber was dark uralak opened the door wider to let in the hallways torchlight it took a moment for his old eyes to adjust as she cautiously shuffled into the room not sure why he closed the door behind him whatever he was to discover he wanted to find it alone the light of the moon was feeble but enough for him to get his bearings and as he moved deeper into the chamber he saw the dark outline of poppys crib against a far wall safely distant from the window then he saw the table overturned and shards of shattered crystal twinkling on the floor what looked like blood or wine or both stained the wood spreading out in a dull pool of scarlet a sweet stench assailed uralaks nostrils he paused trying to unravel what had happened oddly he was not afraid since the news of duke rihards betrayal he had expected this night or one like it quotmy lordquot he asked softly sure that his master wouldnt answer walking in tiny steps he made his way across the chamber carefully avoiding the glass and blood as he made his way to the kings dressing chamber led there by a slick of crimson this chamber was windowless and without a lamp uralak felt blind he did his best to decipher the darkness but once he reached the threshold he stopped there on the floor naked and bloody was a body headless uralak stared at the corpse horrified he wondered if it was the masters the mutilated cadaver lay on its back all its blood spilled from its severed stump of a neck onto the carpeted floor ridiculously uralak thought about the expensive rug and how it would never be the same reality blurred and the old man did not know what to do it was a large corpse large enough to be the king but uralak did not stay to investigate further or to search for the missing head or even to bother wondering why the corpse was naked he simply backed out of the dressing chamber paused in the main room where the broken table and goblets littered the floor and composed himself he could not begin to conceive the plans of his lord and master and had never tried king lorn the wicked had earned his epithet rightfully uralak had never faulted him for that his only concern was how he would explain things to the other soldiers now that their garrison commander was missing without lorn and captain jarrin their defeat was assured by tomorrow certainly they would be dead ever the loyal servant it took only a moment for uralak to resign himself to this when he was ready he left the dark and bloody chamber and went in search of lieutenant vadrick who he supposed was in command now they traveled by moonlight three knights of rolga leading the way north through a canyon shadowed with high peaks guiding the man from carlion toward harn and jazana carr the infant in the mans arms cried constantly obviously distressed and hungry but the group did not rest at the insistence of the man from carlion they rode as quickly as they could ignoring the danger of darkness picking their way along the rutted road despite his wound captain jarrin kept an admirable pace more than once he refused glanes offer to take the child from him glane did not care for children himself but saw the value in this particular whelp and wanted no harm to come to her he worried that jarrin might collapse from his saddle or otherwise drop the infant but the captain continued riding without a word because he could not speak occasionally putting a hand to his bloodied mouth and fixing the bandages while he rode finally when glane could take no more without a rest he called his company to a halt looking up at the craggy peaks he decided it was as good a place as any to stop at least for a short while he was cold and knew that the child was too and so ordered a fire to be made and food to be distributed captain jarrin did not protest king lorn watched through the eye slit of his helm as the rolgan knights dismounted in one arm was cradled his daughter poppy whom he warmed the best he could by holding her close his other armhis sword armkept hold of his stallions reins he watched the rolgans carefully as they began unpacking food and flint lorn could do with a fire but that would have to wait he had gotten this far without being suspected but the moment he took off his helmet would be his discovery and he couldnt risk losing that advantage he couldnt fight from horseback either and that troubled him with poppy in his arms he couldnt ride while wielding a sword but he had done a good job of keeping up his ruse of being wounded and had earned glanes sympathy it did not surprise him when the knight came and offered aid quothere let me take the child so you can dismountquot said glane he held his hands up and his earnest face showed no malice lorn quickly decided it was safe and handed poppy to the man who took the infant and turned his back lorn slipped down from his horse and followed glane to where the two other knights were arranging their things in a ring one of the pair scanned the area for kindling sighting a patch of shrubs sprouting from the rocks by the moons dappled light he moved carefully across the road toward the distant sticks his comrade began unpacking his saddle bag rummaging through it for the little food he had and some flint glane watched him absently holding poppy lorn tapped his shoulder insisting he return the child the knight made a sour face quotwere not going to rob youquot he muttered handing lorn the child quotsit and rest and take that damn helmet offquot glane turned back toward his man as the other knight knelt in the dirt clearing away rocks for their fire lorn took a few paces out of the road set poppy down in her swaddling clothes then drew his sword without a sound before him stood the oblivious glane his back turned as he watched his comrade shuffle rocks and brush away dust as soon as he was in range lorn made his move he did not hesitate for a second as he whistled his sword through the air decapitating glane instantly glanes head flew from his body the body wavered and dropped blood fountained up from its neck spraying the kneeling knight who looked up in confusion to see lorns sword coming down the blade crashed into his forehead splitting it easily opening the throat in midscream on the side of the road poppy began to cry lorn hurriedly removed his helmet tossing it aside as he waited for the third knight to return he pulled the fabric from his mouth cloth he had soaked with jarrins blood in a few moments the remaining rolgan appeared cradling the dry sticks he had gathered he was well upon the camp before he noticed what had happened the two dead bodies slumped in the darkness the imperious figure standing over them incredulous the man dropped his bundle and stared at lorn quotgreat fate quot quoti am king lorn of norvorquot said lorn he stalked a step closer to the knight sword in hand quotand you are the servant of a traitorquot his stupor broken the knight raised his defense at once going for his sword and springing forward lorn hadnt expected his speed but dodged the attack easily sprinting aside and bringing his own blade around the weapon caught the knight in the back sending him sprawling lorn was on him in an instant slamming his booted foot into the knights back before he could rise the man let out a cry again he tried to regain his footing and again lorn kicked him mercilessly driving his boot into his midsection with a howl the sword sprawled from the knights grip desperately he clawed the ground to escape lorn prowled after him quothow quick you were to bring my child to the bitchqueenquot he hissed quotmy daughterquot he punctuated daughter with another callous kick this one hard enough to roll the knight over the man looked up through the darkness breathing hard and bringing up his hands to plea quotenoughquot he shouted quoti had nothing to do with it i swear i was just following ordersquot lorn put the point of his blade to the mans gorget quoti have no interest in your orders dog and i have no mercyquot he pushed the point of his sword through the gorget puncturing the knights throat and coming through the other side pinned there the man gave a gurgling convulsion his legs kicking wildly as his life fled away lorn watched with dispassion then pulled free his sword the knights eyes bulged horribly his hands went to his neck he tried to rise but failed a minute later he was dead lorn sheathed his sword he went to the side of the road where hed left his daughter lifting her and bringing her to the little circle of rocks that had been made there he found the flint struck it once to test it then gathered the sticks the man hed killed had dropped it took some time to make the fire but within several minutes he had it going he made sure poppy was close enough to feel its warmth she would need food and very soon but right now he desperately needed to rest just for a little while king lorn the wicked looked up into the sky of norvor the country he had tried to rule for years the clouds were clearing and he could see stars the heavens seemed to fall on him quotpoppy we have so far to goquot he murmured not sure the girl could hear him they werent safe yet they wouldnt be until they were out of norvor away from jazana carr but at least he had saved his daughter and for that he was glad duke rihards content in king lorns death slept soundly in the camp of his army he had returned to his own pavilion guarded by a slew of his personal knights of rolga and awoke refreshed and prepared for battle he was sure that castle carlion would fall easily and now that the kings daughter had been safely spirited to jazana carr he could give the order he did so at dawn without hesitation all at once his army began to move awakening like a leviathan from the foothills cavalry took to their horses and readied to charge lancemen and infantry got in formation beasts of burden wheeled war machines forward archers stuffed their quivers and stretched their bow hands the battering ram squeaked to life on its oiled wheels and the mismatched army of mercenaries moved out all under the command of duke rihards they had come from all corners of norvor to join jazana carrs crusade the love of gold and diamonds making them loyal duke rihards himself had dressed for the occasion like his heralds and standard bearer he wore the traditional armor of a rolgan warrior green and gold armor with the helmet of a wolf the same symbol emblazoned on their flag as the duke rode out under his standard he could sense the ease of the battle at hand jarrin had put the garrisons strength at barely twohundred a decent number to be sure and they had carlions high walls to protect them but fall they would under greater numbers and might even surrender now that their king was gone a few hundred yards from the castle rihards stopped he had come to a small swell in the land from which he could easily see the battlefield and so decided to command from this spot his many lieutenants and aides guarded him some dismounting others passing along the order to surround carlion the army moved slowly into position fanning out and gradually flanking the fortress the sky was clear by norvan standards the air crisp and cool rihards talked among his aides casually assessing the situation first he would give the loyalists a chance to surrender with their king dead they might welcome a chance to join jazana carrs new regime if that failed he decided they would swarm the castle eventually bringing up the ram to splinter carlions stout gate the order was given and rihards aides went to work relaying orders like the polished professionals they were in less than an hour all his troops were in position the heralds gave the dukes terms terms which rihards felt were exceedingly generous it surprised him when they were summarily refused quotthen they will diequot said rihards he sighed unhappy he would have to spend so much blood and treasure on carlion he turned to his aide lord gondoir a close confidant like glane and fredris quotbring it down gondoirquot he said quotby the end of the day i want to be inside drinking lorns winesquot duke rihards got his wish by noon the exhausted defenders had given carlion their best and were too weak to resist the battering ram or the army of mercenaries that swarmed in to slay them upon the fall of the gate rihards declared that the booty of the castle was to be collected though there was little of it left in carlion whatever spoils they could find would be evenly distributed he had one strict rule thoughthe kings own quarters were not to be disturbed everything else could be taken or destroyed but nothing in lorns rooms were to be touched remarkably his order was obeyed and by early evening rihards himself was able to enter the fortress he trotted in like a hero entering a courtyard spewing smoke and lined with prisoners the ground littered with dead defenders his aide gondoir was with him as they entered a mercenary sergeant and his men had quartered off a section of the yard for prisoners stripping them of all their weapons some were in chains others milled about aimlessly under the threat of rolgan arrows as the prisoners watched the duke enter their keep their eyes betrayed their misery because the duke wasnt known for his mercy they rightfully feared their fates as he rode past themabout a hundred men he supposedhe wondered if he should execute them or wait for jazana carr the women he knew would have to be spared jazana carr did not tolerate rape quotgondoir see to these firesquot ordered rihards quotand get a detail together to gather the bodies the stench is overwhelmingquot quotyes my lordquot replied his aide then rode off with a group of knights rihards continued into the yard stopping at last when he came to the keep and handing off his mount to one of his men at once he recognized colonel fredris who had commanded the assault the colonel looked grave as he approached bowing to the duke quotmy lord the castle is secured weve taken prisoners as youve seen ive already sent a company into the city to tell them whats happened and that youre in command nowquot quotthats all very good news colonelquot said rihards quotso why the long facequot colonel fredris was hesitant quotmy lord weve secured king lorns private chambers as well nothing was disturbed but weve found something i think you should see for yourselfquot fredris was a cautious man so rihards didnt push him further he ordered the colonel to escort him to lorns chambers though he knew the way well the lack of emotion on fredris face alarmed the duke at once he had expected fredris to be overjoyed at the ease of their victory together they made their way through lorns home now a shadow of its glory days lorn had long ago sold off the tapestries and other artwork in an effort to pay for the war his many campaigns against jazana had bankrupted him and his elaborate home but rihards knew of one prize lorn would have never parted with and as he made his way to the kings former chambers he hoped they had not been ransacked and that the ring was still safe a handful of his fellow rolgans bowed to the duke as he passed them knights who were rounding up the last of the women and children all of whom looked at rihards scornfully when at last they reached the wing where king lorn had lived and slept and plotted his many schemes rihards paused there were two knights at the wide wooden door which was closed they had lit the torches in the hall smokey sunlight poured through the windows carved into the bare stone walls quotsoquot rihards asked his colonel quotwhats the problemquot quoti posted guards because i didnt want anyone else to see what was foundquot fredris explained quotmy duke i think you should prepare yourselfquot rihards was too anxious to wait for more information he went to the door immediately and pushed it open entering the familiar chamber like the hallway the room was well lit the dukes eyes went immediately to the toppled table and giant blood stain which had dried and curdled quotlords of hell quot astonished he drifted deeper into the room quotwhat happened herequot quota strugglequot fredris surmised the soldier followed his master toward the grisly scene quotthis isnt all my lord theres something in the dressing chamber you should seequot rihards knew exactly where the dressing chamber was and made a quick beeline there what he saw on the floor shocked and sickened him quotfate above is that lornquot the decapitated naked body lay prone on the floor its flesh a ghastly white from being drained of blood which was all over the floor now quoti dont know who it is my lordquot said fredris quotit could be lorn but why would jarrin do that to himquot quotwhy indeedquot puzzled rihards he leaned over the body thankfully hed never seen lorn naked but the flesh looked too young to be him even in its rigored condition he knew king lorn the wicked too well to not guess what had happened quotfredris wait outside for mequot quotduke rihardsquot quotgoquot fredris did so at once leaving rihards in the gory dressing chamber the duke closed his eyes seething at having been deceived he hadnt killed lorn and he hadnt stolen his daughter either he cursed himself for being so stupid quoti underestimated you my friendquot he muttered quotyou have more lives than a magic catquot he straightened sure that hed been expertly deceived he nevertheless went from the dressing chamber to the bed chamber where he knew lorn kept his most valued possession hidden his ring of kingship to his unpleasant surprise he saw the chest waiting for him on the chambers floor not three paces from the threshold it wasnt hidden it had been left for him to find rihards knew it wouldnt be locked he hesitated for a moment guessing at the chests contents and dreading it then his resolve cresting he went to the iron box and threw its latches angrily he tossed open its lid jarrins severed head stared back at him jeering rihards leaned back on his knees jarrins eyes were open wide as was his mouth a nail had been driven through his forehead pinning a square of paper to him quotyou sick manicquot rihards whispered not surprisingly the ring was gone but the square of paper beckoned him he looked closer and read what it said boldly written in lorns unmistakable handwriting rihardsthe mouth has what you want quotthe mouthquot the idea disgusted rihards jarrins mouth was slightly open coated with dried blood from the extraction of his tongue had lorn actually left the ring inside it he doubted it sure that another nasty surprise awaited him but lorns note had gotten the best of him and he simply could not leave it carefully he pried open the slack jaw peering inside at once he saw the stump of the severed tongue but little else cursing the darkness he reached further into he cavityand felt a stabbing pain quotmother whorequot he jerked back his hand sticking deeply from between two fingers was a pin quotoh heavenquot he groaned staring dumbly at the pin the enormity of his mistake stuck him already his hand was growing numb quotoh no no quot duke rihards looked around desperately stumbling to his feet he saw the doorway and went through it almost tripping over jarrins corpse as he raced for help quotfredrisquot the door to the main chamber flew open and fredris and his knights entered when they saw their duke clutching his outstretched hand they stared in confusion quotmy lord what is itquot asked fredris the colonel hurried closer but rihards could barely see him quoti am poisonedquot he shrieked his vision quickly blurred the palsy in his hand race up his arm quoti cant breathe fredris help mequot horrified fredris and his fellows watched as rihards crumpled to his knees gasping rihards felt the noose of poison strangling him closing off his windpipe with fiery pain blindness overtook him just before his eyes rolled into his head he could barely hear his own screams as his body toppled and shook with convulsions oddly his minds eye pictured lorn quite clearly as he died flashing a fond memory they were in a field riding together it was many peaceful years ago before jazana carr threatened them back when they were friends
