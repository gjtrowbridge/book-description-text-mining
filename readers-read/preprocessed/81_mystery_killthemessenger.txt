 1 la traffic rush hour rush hour at four hours and counting every angelino busting it to get home before the heavens opened up like a bursting bladder and the rains came in a gush the city had been pressed down beneath the weight of an anvil sky all day endless ominous twilight in the concrete canyons between the downtown skyscrapers the air heavy with expectation legs pumping fingers tight on the handlebars fingertips numb eyes on the gap between a jag and a fedex truck quads burning calves like rocks the taste of exhaust eyes dry and stinging behind a pair of swim goggles a bag full of blueprints in cardboard cylinders riding his back the twoway strapped to his thigh like a sixgun barked out bursts of static and the rockcrusted voice of eta fitzgerald the base dispatcher he didn8217t know her real name they called her eta because that was what they heard out of her all day every day eta eta sixteen base to jace eta what8217s your twenty honey he had three minutes to make it to the developer8217s office on the seventeenth floor of a building still blocks away the guard at the front desk was a jerk he locked the doors at six on the dot and had no sympathy for anyone standing on the street trying to get in the guy would have turned his back on his own mother if he had one which jace doubted he looked like something that had sprouted up out of the ground a human toadstool shift his weight to the right cut around the jag he caught the blast of its horn as he ran on his pedals to put a few inches between his back wheel and the car8217s front bumper just ahead of him the traffic light had turned yellow but the fedex truck was running the intersection coming up on the right side of the truck jace reached out and caught hold above the wheel letting the truck carry him through the intersection and down the block he was a master at riding the blind spot if the person behind the wheel saw him and didn8217t want him there a messenger could become a bug on a windshield in a hurry the fedex drivers were usually cool simpatico messenger to messenger they were both connections between people who didn8217t give a rat8217s ass who they were unless they were late with a delivery the building was in sight jace checked over his shoulder let go of the truck and dipped right again cutting across another lane drawing another blaring horn he angled to jump the curb in front of a fire hydrant and behind a cadillac idling in a red zone the car8217s passenger door swung open as the bike went airborne shit jace turned the wheel hard right and twisted his hips left as the bike came down the old lady getting out of the car screamed and fell back into the cadillac the bike8217s front tire hit the sidewalk clear jace held his position as tight as a tick on the back of a dog he touched the brakes with little more than his imagination just enough to break the chaos don8217t panic panic kills ice water jc steel focus calm he kept his eyes on his target he could see the security jerk walking toward the front doors keys in hand shit panic not at threat of injury but at threat of being locked out the customer wouldn8217t care that he had sent the delivery impossibly late or that the messenger had nearly been killed by the door of a cadillac if the package didn8217t make it there would be hell to pay he dropped the bike ten feet from the door sick at the thought it might be gone by the time he got out of the building but there was no time to lock it he bolted for the door tripped himself fell like a boulder and tumbled and skidded arms and legs bouncing like pickup sticks cardboard blueprint tubes shot out of his bag and rolled down the sidewalk no time to assess damage or recognize and catalog pains he forced himself to his feet tripping stumbling trying to scoop up the tubes even as his momentum carried him forward the security jerk stared at him through the glass a lumpy gray face twisted with sour disapproval he turned the key in the lock and walked away 8220hey8221 jace shouted slamming into the glass 8220hey come on8221 the guard pretended not to hear him son of a bitch one minute to six and this guy had nothing more on his mind than getting on the freeway and creeping out to pomona or to the valley or to whatever nondescript shithole suburb he squatted in every night he wasn8217t staying three extra minutes to log in a delivery having the power to walk away was probably the only power he had in his miserable life 8220asshole8221 jace shouted he would have kicked the door but with his luck the damn thing would shatter and he8217d be hauled off to jail not that he couldn8217t have used the rest and three squares a day in jace damon8217s life rest was not an option juggling the cardboard tubes in one arm he yanked his bike up off the sidewalk and climbed back on the entrance to the underground parking garage for the building was on the side street the chain gate would be down but as soon as a car rolled out he could slip in if there was a god in heavenwhich he doubted except in times of dire needsomeone would still be in the developer8217s office on the seventeenth floor hopefully it would be lori the receptionist who was blond and bouncy and would give him a snickers bar from the stash in her bottom drawer he hadn8217t eaten since breakfasta dayold bagel and a shoplifted powerbar he parked himself to the right of the garage entrance back just far enough so as not to be noticed by anyone coming up the ramp he had learned a long time ago to fly below the radar to be invisible and furtive and resourceful survival skills of the street kid his radio made a sound like velcro tearing free 8220sixteen you out there base to jace base to jace hey lone ranger where you at i got money chewing my ass8221 money was eta8217s word for a customer the developer was on the phone screaming at her 8220i8217m in the elevator8221 jace answered he keyed the radio on and off on and off 8220you8217re breaking up base8221 the chain gate rattled to life and began to rise a nastylooking snotgreen chrysler nosed its way up out of the garage the security jerk was behind the wheel jace gave him the finger as he turned into the drive and shot the bike down the ramp the korean guy in the ticket booth barely looked at him as jace darted around the lowered arm that prevented cars from simply rolling in he rode the bike straight to the elevator jumped off as the doors opened and an assortment of welldressed professional people stepped out freed from their cubicles for the day a woman with a helmet of blond hair and a leopardprint raincoat gave him a look like he was dog shit and clutched her designer bag to her as she stepped around him jace forced a grin 8220how8217s it going8221 she sniffed and hurried away people in suits and offices tended to look at bike messengers with wary suspicion they were rebels road warriors fringe citizens in strange costumes invading the orderly respectable world of business most of the messengers jace knew had tattoos all over their bodies and more piercings than a colander they were walking billboards for life on the edge their individuality screaming from their very pores jace made no such statements he wore what he could get for little or nothing at goodwillbaggy shorts and sweatshirts with the sleeves cut off worn over bike shorts and a longsleeved tshirt his hair stuck up in spikes through the openings in his helmet the swim goggles made him look like an alien he pulled the goggles down and rubbed at the grit in his eyes as he rolled the bike into the elevator and punched 17 he could smell himselfstale sweat and exhaust fumes he had run twentythree packages that day and could feel the filth of the city clinging to him like a film he had skinned his knee on the sidewalk out front blood was running in a slow thick trickle down his dirty bare shin to soak into the top of his baggy gray sock when he finally got home and could take a shower the day would come off him like a mud slide and he would become a blond white kid again he would spend a couple of hours with his little brother tyler then hit the books until he fell asleep on them too soon it would be fivethirty and another day would begin with him shoveling ice into the coolers at the fish market they lived over in chinatown my life sucks he allowed himself to acknowledge that fact only once in a while what was the point in dwelling on it he didn8217t plan on staying where he was in the grand scheme of things that was the thought to focus on change improvement the future he had a future tyler had a futurejace had made sure of that and would continue to make sure of it and their futures would be a thousand times better than anything life had given them so far it was only a matter of time and focus and will the elevator dinged and the doors pulled open the developer8217s office was down the hall on the left suite 1701 major development lori the cute receptionist was gone along with the chance for a free snickers mr major development was standing at her desk shouting into the phone he stopped abruptly and slammed the receiver down as jace walked in with the blueprint tubes 8220well it8217s about fucking time8221 major shouted 8220my eightyyearold mother could have gotten here faster with her walker8221 8220sorry8221 jace said handing over the manifest he offered no excuse or explanation he knew from experience it wouldn8217t matter what mattered to mr major development was that he now had his blueprints and could get on with his life major snatched the manifest away from him scribbled a signature and shoved it back at him no thanks no tip no nothing lori the receptionist might have noticed the scrape on his knee and given him a bandaid and sympathy along with the snickers bar all he got was the fantasy at least in his imaginary social life he could afford to take a girl out someplace decent back out on the street he radioed base to confirm the delivery he would make it back to the base office in fifteen and spend half an hour matching his delivery receipts with eta8217s floatersthe notes she made assigning jobs to messengers by sevenfifteen he could be standing in the shower 8220sixteen to base jace to base got pod on major pain in the ass8221 8220tenfour angel you8217ll go to heaven yet8221 8220i

you8217re it lone ranger and baby you8217re the best8221 she gave him the address for the pickup and delivery and told him he could use the tip he would get to buy her a diamond ring jace sat on his bike under the security light beside the garage entrance and stared at the note he8217d written with the name and address and he thought of the only tip anyone had ever given him that was of any real value it8217s better to be lucky than good as he folded the note it began to rain
