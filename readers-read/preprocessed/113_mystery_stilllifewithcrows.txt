 one medicine creek kansas early august sunset the great sea of yellow corn stretches from horizon to horizon under an angry sky when the wind rises the corn stirs and rustles as if alive and when the wind dies down again the corn falls silent the heat wave is now in its third week and dead air hovers over the corn in shimmering curtains one road cuts through the corn from north to south another from east to west where the two roads cross lies the town sad gray buildings huddle together at the intersection gradually thinning along both roads into separate houses then scattered farms and then nothing a creek edged by scraggly trees wanders in from the northwest loops lazily around the town and disappears in the southeast it is the only curved thing in this landscape of straight lines to the northeast rises a cluster of mounds surrounded by trees a giant slaughterhouse stands south of the town lost in the corn its metal sides scoured by years of dust storms the faint odor of blood and disinfectant drifts in a plume southward from the plant riding the fitful currents of air beyond just over the horizon stand three gigantic grain silos like a tallmasted ship lost at sea the temperature is exactly one hundred degrees heat lightning flickers silently along the distant northern horizon the corn is seven feet high the fat cobs clustered on the stalks harvest is two weeks away onetwilight is falling over the landscape the orange sky bleeds away into red a handful of streetlights blink on in the town a blackandwhite police cruiser passes along the main street heading east into the great nothingness of corn its headlights stabbing into the rising darkness some three miles ahead of the cruiser a column of slowcircling turkey vultures rides a thermal above the corn they wheel down then rise up again circling endlessly uneasily rising and falling in a regular cadence sheriff dent hazen fiddled with the dashboard knobs and cursed at the tepid air that streamed from the vents he felt the vent with the back of his hand but it wasnt getting any cooler the ac had finally bit the dust he muttered another imprecation and cranked down the window tossing out his cigarette butt furnacelike air boiled in and the cruiser filled with the smell of latesummer kansas earth cornstalks he could see the circling turkey buzzards rise and dip rise and dip above the dying smear of sunset along the horizon one ugly motherfucker of a bird thought hazen and he glanced over at the longbarreled winchester defender lying on the seat beside him with any luck hed get close enough to assist two or three of them into the next world he slowed and glanced once again at the dark birds silhouetted against the sky why the hell arent any of them landing turning off the main road he eased the cruiser onto one of the many rutted dirt lanes that cut their way through the thousand square miles of corn surrounding medicine creek he moved forward keeping a watch on the sky until the birds were almost directly overhead this was as close as he was going to get by car from here hed have to walk he threw the cruiser into park and more out of habit than necessity snapped on the lightbar flashers he eased his frame out of the cruiser and stood for a moment facing the wall of corn drawing a rough hand across his stubbled chin the rows went in the wrong direction and it was going to be a bitch getting through them just the thought of shouldering through all those rows made him weary and for a moment he thought about putting the cruiser in reverse and getting the hell back to town but it was too late for that now the neighbors call had already been logged old wilma lowry had nothing better to do but look out her window and report the location of dead animals but this was his last call of the day and a few extra hours on friday evening at least guaranteed him a long lazy boozy sunday fishing at hamilton lake state park hazen lit another cigarette coughed and scratched himself looking at the dry ranks of corn he wondered if it was somebodys cow whod wandered into the corn and was now dead of bloat and greed since when was it a sheriff s responsibility to check on dead livestock but he already knew the answer ever since the livestock inspector retired there was nobody to take his place and no longer a need for one every year there were fewer family farms fewer livestock fewer people most people only kept cows and horses for nostalgic reasons the whole county was going to hell realizing hed put off the task long enough hazen sighed hiked up his jangling service belt slipped his flashlight out of its scabbard shouldered the shotgun and pushed his way into the corn despite the lateness of the hour the sultry air refused to lift the beam of his light flashed through the cornstalks stretching before him like endless rows of prison bars his nose filled with the smell of dry stalks that peculiar rusty smell so familiar it was part of his very being his feet crunched dry clods of earth kicking up dust it had been a wet spring and until the heat wave kicked in a few weeks back the summer sun had been benevolent the stalks were as high as hazen could ever remember at least a foot or more over his head amazing how fast the black earth could turn to dust without rain once as a kid hed run into a cornfield to escape his older brother and gotten lost for two hours the disorientation hed felt then came back to him now inside the corn rows the air felt trapped hot fetid itchy hazen took a deep drag on the cigarette and continued forward knocking the fat cobs aside with irritation the field belonged to buswell agricon of atlanta and sheriff hazen could not have cared less if they lost a few ears because of his rough passage within two weeks agricons huge combine harvesters would appear on the horizon mowing down the corn each feeding half a dozen streams of kernels into their hoppers the corn would be trucked to the cluster of huge grain silos just over the northern horizon and from there railed to feed lots from nebraska to missouri to disappear down the throats of mindless castrated cattle which would in turn be transformed into big fat marbled sirloins for rich assholes in new york and tokyo or maybe this was one of those gasohol fields where the corn wasnt eaten by man or even beast but burned up in the engines of cars instead what a world hazen bullied his way through row after row already his nose was running he tossed his cigarette away then realized he should probably have pinched it off first hell with it a thousand acres of the damn corn could burn and buswell agricon wouldnt even notice they should take care of their own fields pick up their own dead animals of course the executives had probably never set foot in a real cornfield in their lives like almost everyone else in medicine creek hazen came from a farming family that no longer farmed they had sold their land to companies like buswell agricon the population of medicine creek had been dropping for more than half a century and the great industrial cornfields were now dotted with abandoned houses their empty window frames staring like dead eyes over the billowy main of crops but hazen had stayed not that he liked medicine creek particularly what he liked was wearing a uniform and being respected he liked the town because he knew the town every last person every dark corner every nasty secret truth was he simply couldnt imagine himself anywhere else he was as much a part of medicine creek as medicine creek was a part of him hazen stopped suddenly he swept his beam through the stalks ahead the air full of dust now carried another smell the perfume of decay he glanced up the buzzards were far above now directly over his head another fifty yards and he would be there the air was still the silence complete he unshouldered his shotgun and moved forward more cautiously the smell of decay drifted through the rows sweeter by the moment now hazen could make out a gap in the corn a clearing directly ahead of him odd the sky had flamed its red farewell and was now dark the sheriff raised his gun eased off the safety with his thumb and broke through the last corn row into the clearing for a moment he looked around in wild incomprehension and then rather suddenly he realized what he was looking at the gun went off when it hit the ground and the load of doubleought buckshot blew by hazens ear but the sheriff barely noticed
