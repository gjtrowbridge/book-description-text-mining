 the letter it was november although it was not yet late the sky was dark when i turned into laundress passage father had finished for the day switched off the shop lights and closed the shutters but so i would not come home to darkness he had left on the light over the stairs to the flat through the glass in the door it cast a foolscap rectangle of paleness onto the wet pavement and it was while i was standing in that rectangle about to turn my key in the door that i first saw the letter another white rectangle it was on the fifth step from the bottom where i couldnt miss it i closed the door and put the shop key in its usual place behind baileys advanced principles of geometry poor bailey no one has wanted his fat gray book for thirty years sometimes i wonder what he makes of his role as guardian of the bookshop keys i dont suppose its the destiny he had in mind for the masterwork that he spent two decades writing a letter for me that was something of an event the crispcornered envelope puffed up with its thickly folded contents was addressed in a hand that must have given the postman a certain amount of trouble although the style of the writing was oldfashioned with its heavily embellished capitals and curly flourishes my first impression was that it had been written by a child the letters seemed untrained their uneven strokes either faded into nothing or were heavily etched into the paper there was no sense of flow in the letters that spelled out my name each had been undertaken separately m a r g a r e t l e a as a new and daunting enterprise but i knew no children that is when i thought it is the hand of an invalid it gave me a queer feeling yesterday or the day before while i had been going about my business quietly and in private some unknown person some stranger had gone to the trouble of marking my name onto this envelope who was it who had had his minds eye on me while i hadnt suspected a thing still in my coat and hat i sank onto the stair to read the letter i never read without making sure i am in a secure position i have been like this ever since the age of seven when sitting on a high wall and reading the water babies i was so seduced by the descriptions of underwater life that i unconsciously relaxed my muscles instead of being held buoyant by the water that so vividly surrounded me in my mind i plummeted to the ground and knocked myself out i can still feel the scar under my fringe now reading can be dangerous i opened the letter and pulled out a sheaf of half a dozen pages all written in the same laborious script thanks to my work i am experienced in the reading of difficult manuscripts there is no great secret to it patience and practice are all that is required that and the willingness to cultivate an inner eye when you read a manuscript that has been damaged by water fire light or just the passing of the years your eye needs to study not just the shape of the letters but other marks of production the speed of the pen the pressure of the hand on the page breaks and releases in the flow you must relax think of nothing until you wake into a dream where you are at once a pen flying over vellum and the vellum itself with the touch of ink tickling your surface then you can read it the intention of the writer his thoughts his hesitations his longings and his meaning you can read as clearly as if you were the very candlelight illuminating the page as the pen speeds over it not that this letter was anything like as challenging as some it began with a curt miss lea thereafter the hieroglyphs resolved themselves quickly into characters then words then sentences this is what i read i once did an interview for the banbury herald i must look it out one of these days for the biography strange chap they sent me a boy really as tall as a man but with the puppy fat of youth awkward in his new suit the suit was brown and ugly and meant for a much older man the collar the cut the fabric all wrong it was the kind of thing a mother might buy for a boy leaving school for his first job imagining that her child will somehow grow into it but boys do not leave their boyhood behind when they leave off their school uniform there was something in his manner an intensity the moment i set eyes on him i thought aha whats he after ive nothing against people who love truth apart from the fact that they make dull companions just so long as they dont start on about storytelling and honesty the way some of them do naturally that annoys me but provided they leave me alone i wont hurt them my gripe is not with lovers of the truth but with truth herself what succor what consolation is there in truth compared to a story what good is truth at midnight in the dark when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney when the lightning strikes shadows on the bedroom wall and the rain taps at the window with its long fingernails no when fear and cold make a statue of you in your bed dont expect hardboned and fleshless truth to come running to your aid what you need are the plump comforts of a story the soothing rocking safety of a lie some writers dont like interviews of course they get cross about it same old questions they complain well what do they expect reporters are hacks we writers are the real thing just because they always ask the same questions it doesnt mean we have to give them the same old answers does it i mean making things up its what we do for a living so i give dozens of interviews a year hundreds over the course of a lifetime for i have never believed that genius needs to be locked away out of sight to thrive my genius is not so frail a thing that it cowers from the dirty fingers of the newspapermen in the early years they used to try to catch me out they would do research come along with a little piece of truth concealed in their pocket draw it out at an opportune moment and hope to startle me into revealing more i had to be careful inch them in the direction i wanted them to take use my bait to draw them gently imperceptibly toward a prettier story than the one they had their eye on a delicate operation their eyes would start to shine and their grasp on the little chip of truth would loosen until it dropped from their hand and fell disregarded by the wayside it never failed a good story is always more dazzling than a broken piece of truth afterward once i became famous the vida winter interview became a sort of rite of passage for journalists they knew roughly what to expect would have been disappointed to leave without the story a quick run through the normal questions where do you get your inspiration are your characters based on real people how much of your main character is you and the shorter my answers the better they liked it inside my head no none then the bit they were waiting for the thing they had really come for a dreamy expectant look stole across their faces they were like little children at bedtime and you miss winter they said tell me about yourself and i told simple little stories really not much to them just a few strands woven together in a pretty pattern a memorable motif here a couple of sequins there mere scraps from the bottom of my ragbag hundreds more where they came from offcuts from novels and stories plots that never got finished stillborn characters picturesque locations i never found a use for odds and ends that fell out in the editing then its just a matter of neatening the edges stitching in the ends and its done another brandnew biography they went away happy clutching their notebooks in their paws like children with sweets at the end of a birthday party it would be something to tell their grandchildren one day i met vida winter and she told me a story anyway the boy from the banbury herald he said miss winter tell me the truth now what kind of appeal is that ive had people devise all kinds of stratagems to trick me into telling and i can spot them a mile off but that laughable i mean whatever did he expect a good question what did he expect his eyes were glistening with an intent fever he watched me so closely seeking probing he was after something quite specific i was sure of it his forehead was damp with perspiration perhaps he was sickening for something tell me the truth he said i felt a strange sensation inside like the past coming to life the watery stirring of a previous life turning in my belly creating a tide that rose in my veins and sent cool wavelets to lap at my temples the ghastly excitement of it tell me the truth i considered his request i turned it over in my mind weighed up the likely consequences he disturbed me this boy with his pale face and his burning eyes all right i said an hour later he was gone a faint absentminded goodbye and no backward glance i didnt tell him the truth how could i i told him a story an impoverished malnourished little thing no sparkle no sequins just a few dull and faded patches roughly tacked together with the edges left frayed the kind of story that looks like real life or what people imagine real life to be which is something rather different its not easy for someone of my talent to produce a story like that i watched him from the window he shuffled away up the street shoulders drooping head bowed each step a weary effort all that energy the charge the verve gone i had killed it not that i take all the blame he should have known better than to believe me i never saw him again that feeling i had the current in my stomach my temples my fingertips it remained with me for quite a while it rose and fell with the memory of the boys words tell me the truth no i said over and over again no but it wouldnt be still it was a distraction more than that it was a danger in the end i did a deal not yet it sighed it fidgeted but eventually it fell quiet so quiet that i as good as forgot about it what a long time ago that was thirty years forty more perhaps time passes more quickly than you think the boy has been on my mind lately tell me the truth and lately i have felt again that strange inner stirring there is something growing inside me dividing and multiplying i can feel it in my stomach round and hard about the size of a grapefruit it sucks the air out of my lungs and gnaws the marrow from my bones the long dormancy has changed it from being a meek and biddable thing it has become a bully it refuses all negotiation blocks discussion insists on its rights it wont take no for an answer the truth it echoes calling after the boy watching his departing back and then it turns to me tightens its grip on my innards gives a twist we made a deal remember it is time come on monday i will send a car to meet you from the half past four arrival at harrogate station vida winter how long did i sit on the stairs after reading the letter i dont know for i was spellbound there is something about words in expert hands manipulated deftly they take you prisoner wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk and when you are so enthralled you cannot move they pierce your skin enter your blood numb your thoughts inside you they work their magic when i at last woke up to myself i could only guess what had been going on in the darkness of my unconsciousness what had the letter done to me i knew very little about vida winter i was aware naturally of the various epithets that usually came attached to her name englands bestloved writer our centurys dickens the worlds most famous living author and so on i knew of course that she was popular though the figures when i later researched them still came as a surprise fiftysix books published in fiftysix years they are translated into fortynine languages miss winter has been named twentyseven times the most borrowed author from english libraries nineteen feature films have been based on her novels in terms of statistics the most disputed question is this has she or has she not sold more books than the bible the difficulty comes less from working out how many books she has sold an everchanging figure in the millions than in obtaining solid figures for the bible whatever one thinks of the word of god his sales data are notoriously unreliable the figure that might have interested me the most as i sat there at the bottom of the stairs was twentytwo this was the number of biographers who for want of information or lack of encouragement or after inducements or threats from miss winter herself had been persuaded to give up trying to discover the truth about her but i knew none of this then i knew only one statistic and it was one that seemed relevant how many books by vida winter had i margaret lea read none i shivered on the stairs yawned and stretched returning to myself i found that my thoughts had been rearranged in my absence two items in particular had been selected out of the unheeded detritus that is my memory and placed for my attention the first was a little scene involving my father a box of books we are unpacking from a private library clearance includes a number of vida winters at the shop we dont deal in contemporary fiction ill take them to the charity shop in my lunch hour i say and leave them on the side of the desk but before the morning is out three of the four books are gone sold one to a priest one to a cartographer one to a military historian our clients faces with the customary outward paleness and inner glow of the book lover seem to light up when they spot the rich colors of the paperback covers after lunch when we have finished the unpacking and the cataloging and the shelving and we have no customers we sit reading as usual it is late autumn it is raining and the windows have misted up in the background is the hiss of the gas heater we hear the sound without hearing it for side by side together and miles apart we are deep in our books shall i make tea i ask surfacing no answer i make tea all the same and put a cup next to him on the desk an hour later the untouched tea is cold i make a fresh pot and put another steaming cup beside him on the desk he is oblivious to my every movement gently i tilt the volume in his hands so that i can see the cover it is the fourth vida winter i return the book to its original position and study my fathers face he cannot hear me he cannot see me he is in another world and i am a ghost that was the first memory the second is an image in threequarter profile carved massively out of light and shade a face towers over the commuters who wait stunted beneath it is only an advertising photograph pasted on a billboard in a railway station but to my minds eye it has the impassive grandeur of longforgotten queens and deities carved into rock faces by ancient civilizations to contemplate the exquisite arc of the eye the broad smooth sweep of the cheekbones the impeccable line and proportions of the nose is to marvel that the randomness of human variation can produce something so supernaturally perfect as this such bones discovered by the archaeologists of the future would seem an artifact a product not of blunttooled nature but of the very peak of artistic endeavor the skin that embellishes these remarkable bones has the opaque luminosity of alabaster it appears paler still by contrast with the elaborate twists and coils of copper hair that are arranged with such precision about the fine temples and down the strong elegant neck as if this extravagant beauty were not enough there are the eyes intensified by some photographic sleight of hand to an inhuman green the green of glass in a church window or of emeralds or of boiled sweets they gaze out over the heads of the commuters with perfect inexpression i cant say whether the other travelers that day felt the same way as i about the picture they had read the books so they may have had a different perspective on things but for me looking into the large green eyes i could not help being reminded of that commonplace expression about the eyes being the gateway to the soul this woman i remember thinking as i gazed at her green unseeing eyes does not have a soul such was on the night of the letter the extent of my knowledge about vida winter it was not much though on reflection perhaps it was as much as anyone else might know for although everyone knew vida winter knew her name knew her face knew her books at the same time nobody knew her as famous for her secrets as for her stories she was a perfect mystery now if the letter was to be believed vida winter wanted to tell the truth about herself this was curious enough in itself but curiouser still was my next thought why should she want to tell it to me
