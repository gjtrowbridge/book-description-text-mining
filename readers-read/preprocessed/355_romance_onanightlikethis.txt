 chapter one blair lifted the man8217s arm and slid out from under him she tucked a pillow back in her place and he embraced it easily she smiled at that men she gathered her clothes from the floor and tucked them under her arm picked up her shoes stopped in the doorway she looked back at the man his long lean body curled away from her his hair a tousled mess his face half buried in the pillow i could climb back into bed and stay there awhile she thought she closed the door quietly behind her the hallway of his apartment was dark and she slid her hand along the wall until she found a light switch flicked it on squinted in the sudden brightness she hadn8217t looked at the clock had she slept all night or only an hour or two she headed down the hall drowsily dropped a shoe which thudded on the hardwood floor another door opened and a woman appeared pajamaed and sleeprumpled blair recovered her shoe stood and shrugged naked too slow to cover herself up 8220are you a roommate or a

therapist these days gotta run it8217s been grand8221 she opened the door walked out pulled it closed behind her blair caught the last bus to the haight walked a couple of blocks turned down her street on the edge of the haight on the edge of a park on the edge of elegance she lived in a rented cottage behind a mansion a dilapidated mansion in the middle of finely refurbished victorians most graced with pastel colors hers boasting a loud honking purple the neighbors hated it of course which was casey8217s plan casey sat on his front steps smoking a joint at midnight she wasn8217t surprised her landlord had inherited money and the mansion he coasted through life women and drugs she put up with him because she loved the cottage 8220come join me8221 he called out before she turned down the driveway toward her haven 8220gotta go amanda8217s waiting8221 8220one hit8221 he urged 8220you8217ll sleep better8221 couldn8217t argue with that blair walked down the path to the front patio joined him midstep 8220where were you8221 he asked passing the joint 8220none of your business8221 she said taking in a good long hit of the pot 8220sex8221 he said 8220i can smell it8221

an omelette8221 8220can i join you i8217ll bring wine8221 8220no8221 she started off across the ruined grass of the front yard 8220are you sick8221 casey called out blair stopped turned around

somehow it came out as a question this time how do you answer a question like that she shook her head8212it still sounded as if the words had been formed in someone else8217s mouth 8220thanks for the smoke8221 she turned and headed back behind the house following a string of white christmas lights that she used to line the path from the driveway to her cottage tucked in the far corner of the backyard the cottage was really a tiny apartment over a garage but it was built in 1910 all in pine8212walls floors ceiling8212and was graced by a tree that hung over and around the house making it feel more tree house than garage 8220i8217m sick8221 she muttered to herself trying a different take no that8217s beside the point i8217m dying is the point 8220i8217m dying8221 is what she needed to tell her daughter she climbed the wooden stairs to the cottage and caught the pungent smell of sauteacuteed onion and garlic saw amanda8217s willowy shadow against the white curtain in the tiny kitchen heard the africandrumming cd that amanda listened to late at night with the lights dimmed low she paused for a moment before turning the doorknob not yet she thought not tonight she pushed the door open breathed in smiled the small pinewalled living room was tented with lilacdyed muslin billowing from the ceiling8212blair always felt like she was entering her own exotic harem 8220amanda my sweet girl8221 she called amanda appeared in the doorway boxer shorts cotton camisole untamed red curls beaming 8220you better be hungry8221 8220ravenous8221 blair dropped her bag on the floor beelined for her daughter she ruffled her hair planted a kiss on her ear 8220you got taller8221 she said looking her kid straight in the eye 8220since this morning8221 8220yeah i think you beat me finally8221 8220turn around8221 they turned backtoback butttobutt headtohead exactly the same height but amanda was fairskinned and her mother dark and amanda8217s body was narrower her bones sharper she looked like she was about a minute away from becoming a woman having shed her child8217s body only seconds before 8220you didn8217t sneak past me8221 blair said patting their heads together 8220yet8221 they moved toward the table a battered wood schoolteacher8217s desk which sat in the middle of the tiny room that served as their dining room blair dropped exhausted into one of the wooden chairs 8220i8217ll get dinner8221 amanda said there was barely room in the kitchen for both of them blair watched her daughter she somehow felt she could see amanda in all her incarnations8212she was the joyous fiveyearold the headstrong eightyearold the surly twelveyearold and now this the lovely young woman8212in a flash of an eye even now with a tattoo peeking above her tank top she was blair8217s baby a few months ago amanda had come home with rove tattooed on her chest just below her collarbone blair used to think she knew her daughter completely knew every expression every gesture rove what did it mean was this amanda8217s first hint of mystery 8220my boss said i can work an extra night at the cafeacute if i want to8221 amanda said 8220you want more work8221 blair asked 8220why8221 8220i want the money8221 8220you don8217t need the money when was the last time you bought new clothes8221 amanda owned two pairs of jeans8212one red and the other lime green8212and an odd assortment of bowling shirts hawaiian shirts tuxedo shirts8212whatever she found at the vintage clothing store down the street she looked like a kid playing dressup the clothes always too big for her bound around her waist by bejeweled belts she looked like no other kid at her high school and blair was proud of her for it 8220i buy cds8221 amanda said and help pay the rent blair thought she grabbed her daughter8217s hand as she passed by and pulled her close 8220you8217re too grown up my girl8221 blair said 8220i like working there8221 amanda said 8220and when it8217s quiet i can get my homework done8221 8220how about parties friends goofing off8221 blair asked while amanda set the table 8220yeah right8221 amanda said 8220is it my fault8221 blair asked 8220if i didn8217t love you so much you8217d go have fun somewhere else8221 amanda leaned over and placed her fingers on her mother8217s lips 8220stop worrying about me8221 she told her 8220could you bring me a glass of wine sweetheart8221 the wine appeared already poured and waiting blair took it from amanda and grinned when amanda turned back into the kitchen blair closed her eyes squeezing them tight not pain just too much noise in her head 8220do you eat lunch by yourself at school8221 blair asked 8220why8221 8220i8217m curious i hated lunch at school it was the most miserable time8221 8220i read a book8221 amanda said quietly 8220it doesn8217t matter8221 8220it does matter sweetheart8221 blair told her 8220you need to talk to someone8221 8220i talk to you8221 blair watched amanda in the kitchen moving from pan to bowl to silverware drawer to stove her hands always moving every gesture as graceful as a dance 8220you8217re not lonely8221 blair asked quietly 8220no mom i8217m fine i hate school ok but work8217s fine and then i come home8221 8220i know8221 blair said 8220dinner8221 amanda announced presenting the pan with a grand swoop of her arm a perfect omelette 8220bravo8221 blair said she was a chef her daughter had learned well and she shared with her the appreciation of good food amanda slid the omelette onto blair8217s plate 8220you eating8221 blair asked 8220lasagna8221 she said 8220i told you8221 8220how many nights will you work8221 blair asked she tasted her omelette while they talked 8220it8217s up to me i can match the nights you work so we can be home on the same nights8221 8220i might quit the restaurant8221 blair said though she hadn8217t thought about that yet her mind was racing through too many things8212money illness leaving her daughter and now this idea leaving her work 8220quit cooking why8221 8220burnout i8217m exhausted8221 8220since when what are you talking about8221 blair got up from the table she turned looking for somewhere to go 8220i8217ve got to pee8221 she said heading into the bathroom she shut the door behind her and leaned back against it pressed hard against the spot where her mole had been under her bra strap the mole that scraped and bled and healed and scraped and bled until finally she showed her doc during a routine physical and the good doctor cut the mole tested the mole and pronounced her dead on arrival melanoma advanced stage why the hell didn8217t you do anything about this because i was busy because i8217ve got a daughter and a crazy job and not enough money because i don8217t pay attention to the details 8220mom8221 8220coming8221 she flushed the toilet and splashed water on her face opened the door sat down at the table knew that amanda was watching her she had told the doc 8220i can accept dying for me but not for my daughter she8217s got no one else8221 8220the omelette8217s delicious8221 blair said staring at it 8220you had a doctor8217s appointment this afternoon8221 amanda said 8220you

break from cooking for a while8221 8220what is it8221 8220a virus i just need to rest some and i need to eat omelettes that8217s the magic cure8221 blair picked up her fork and started eating her stomach was rototilling and she could barely swallow her food amanda still watched her 8220you8217re lying8221 amanda said 8220i8217m not lying8221 blair barked 8220don8217t accuse me of lying i8217m sick you think i8217m happy about it you think i want to stop cooking after all these years8221 amanda8217s chair banged back against the wall and she was gone the door to her room slammed shut just as the chair clattered to the floor blair pushed her plate away and dropped her head to the table the good doctor had said 8220do you have family8221 8220no my parents died years ago8221 8220there8217s a support group at the hospital8221 8220i don8217t need a support group8221 blair had said 8220you8217re not alone in this8221 the doctor said 8220you have to think about your daughter8221 8220that8217s all i can think about8221 blair had walked out leaving prescriptions for pain that would come phone numbers for people who would tell her how to cope pamphlets that would describe how she would die she walked out and kept walking from the haight to the mission from bar to bar drinking a shot of tequila moving on when she met the man with the deep voice and the soft touch she was numb enough to go home with him numb enough to make love until they slept numb enough to forget amanda until she woke up she picked up her fork and took another bite of her omelette her hunger was gone she drank her wine hours of tequila sex and pot and still she couldn8217t turn off her brain 8220amanda8221 she called the door flew open and amanda appeared 8220what8221 8220i8217m sorry i yelled i hate being sick8221 8220what8217s wrong with you8221 amanda asked suspiciously 8220i told you8221 blair drank the rest of her wine 8220a goddamn virus8221 8220what kind of virus8221

blair leaned over and kissed her on the top of her head like a blessing 82208217night mom8221 8220good night sweetheart i love your omelette8221 8220that8217s two lies in one night8221 amanda said heading back into her room and shutting the door behind her blair heard amanda rattle around in the kitchen early the next morning she didn8217t move chronic fatigue syndrome wouldn8217t that be nice too tired to care she listened to the noise of amanda8217s morning routine now she8217s getting the milk now she8217s pulling her cereal from the pantry that8217s the cabinet for the bowl drawer for the spoon see she doesn8217t need me where does a kid live when she8217s sixteen and she8217s an orphan no way she8217s going to an orphanage does she stay here in the cottage take her books and head to school come home and make herself dinner go to bed wake up take her books and head to school blair buried herself deeper in the bed smothering the sounds of amanda surviving without her when she came up for air the cottage was silent8212amanda was gone and somehow blair slept until she heard the door open and thought she8217s home i8217ve slept all day no an hour had passed 8220amanda8221 she called out tentatively and for the first time she thought it8217s an intruder a rapist a madman he8217ll kill me hot damn i won8217t have to spend so much time dying after all but still there was the problem of amanda how could the best thing in my life blair thought become the worst thing in my life my daughter and then another door opened her own bedroom door and the madman stood there in the form of her landlord casey 8220what the hell are you doing here8221 8220checking up on you8221 8220i don8217t need checking up on and you didn8217t knock8221 8220i have a key8221 8220you don8217t have

nothing to do with your being horny8221 8220thought maybe you8217d want to forget about your troubles8221 8220casey8221 blair moaned but she pulled back the covers and he walked toward her throwing off his clothes on the way casey was tall skinny balding and bearded a caricature of an aging hippie but he loved sex almost as much as he loved drugs and if he wasn8217t high on anything other than pot he was a wonderful lover so blair let him in her bed from time to time8212though he asked too often and stayed too long 8220get a girlfriend casey get a wife8221 she said looking up at him 8220you8217re beautiful8221 he said he reached down and stroked her arm 8220for about another minute8221 she wasn8217t beautiful but men found her exotic or sexy or something8212it had proved true through all the stages of her life now at fortytwo she was still fit probably because she walked back and forth to work ate little because she spent so much time around food and seemed to be in motion all the time8212even in the small spaces of her restaurant kitchen or tiny cottage she was dark her hair cut short but untamed with loose curls that framed her face and fell across her eyes her features were all a little large8212her eyes wide her nose long her lips full8212and though she saw the faults in that when she looked in the mirror men saw a kind of lush ripe territory they wanted to explore 8220you contagious8221 casey asked 8220no climb in8221 8220you hurt anywhere8221 he asked sliding into bed beside her curling his body around hers his hands started moving over her skin sending little shock currents through her 8220not anymore8221 she murmured moving closer breathing him in 8220what is it blair what8217s wrong with you8221 he asked moving over her body their legs tangling their breath finding the space in the crook of each other8217s neck 8220not enough sex8221 she whispered he pushed himself down in the bed drawing lines with his tongue over her full breasts between them down along the flat slope of her stomach when he buried his face between her legs she moaned and felt herself open8212her legs her chest her heart and then she was crying but he didn8217t notice so he kept sucking her and her legs wrapped around his neck so that he wouldn8217t stop when she came she pushed him over and climbed on top of him sliding his cock inside of her not waiting for his rhythm his desire his need she rocked against him pulled away her body lifted her head thrown back she was still coming then he sat up pushing her back so this time he was leaning over her plunging into her hard so hard that she thought he might break her and she wanted him to go further to make her body hurt from so much feeling and suddenly he pulled out of her and grabbed himself in his hand and let himself come all over her stomach she looked at him he had his eyes closed and his mouth spread across his face in a sweet smile stoned he was probably stoned at nine o8217clock in the morning he opened his eyes and looked at her 8220you8217re crying8221 he said she shook her head 8220we should do that more often8221 he said again she shook her head he lay down next to her upside down in the bed 8220go away casey8221 she said 8220give me five minutes darling just let me lie here next to you8221 8220five minutes8221 she told him 8220then go away and never come back i don8217t want to do this anymore8221 he leaned up on his elbow gazed down at her 8220did i hurt you8221 8220not enough8221 she said she closed her eyes rolled away from him 8220please8221 she said her voice hard 8220go8221 she kept her back to him while he stood put on his clothes moved toward the door she waited turned away from him until she heard him leave when the door clicked closed behind him she lay in bed for a moment contemplating sleep but she thought about the cancer in her body and felt heavy weighed down by so many black cancer cells pressing her into the mattress she pushed herself upright and began to tremble she would die she would die before her daughter finished high school before she finished growing up before she found boyfriends lost boyfriends chose careers and changed them again found new cities new homes blair would die and someone would take her place in the kitchen at the cafeacute someone would move into the cottage casey and perry would find other women to love for a moment or two but no one would step in as amanda8217s mother no one would love her daughter with the same passion the same joy blair forced herself out of bed she needed to stop the shaking in her body she threw on a kimono went into the kitchen to put up water for tea the kettle wobbled in her unsteady hand she remembered a moment in her childhood8212she had watched hitchcock8217s the birds one evening she might have been eleven or twelve8212and she woke in the middle of the night screaming her mother was in her room before she herself was fully awake the screams just beginning to subside her mother held her quietly stroking her head waiting until blair mumbled something about the black sky of birds 8220shh8221 her mother said holding blair letting her fall back to sleep in her arms i need someone to hold me blair thought her parents were killed when blair was twentysix they had taken their first real vacation a fishing trip to mexico and chose to drive to baja because flights were so expensive the police said they must have been lost to have ended up in such a godforsaken town in the middle of the mountains a couple of teenage boys stopped their car robbed them and when blair8217s father had a heart attack the boys panicked and shot blair8217s mother they stole 345 and the old buick leaving the couple in a ravine at the side of the road blair thought about her parents guns pointed in their faces was her mother holding her father who would have already fallen to the ground was her father already dead her mother already mourning him when the bullet pierced her own heart or had her mother been shot first and her dad8217s heart stopped cold at the thought of life without her did either have time to think about death did they die instantly were they lucky to die so quickly with so little time to spend contemplating death a policewoman came to her apartment in soho where she was living at the time where the latest boyfriend had just moved out where she had just learned that she was pregnant that morning and already she had an appointment for an abortion at the clinic in the village 8220i8217m sorry sugar8221 the cop said after telling her about her parents8217 deaths and blair had looked at her confused why is she calling me sugar my mother called me sugar did she know that the woman repeated the story to blair as if she hadn8217t heard enough the first time and still she couldn8217t react couldn8217t make sense of any of it until the policewoman left and blair crumbled blair found things to do to keep herself busy8212collect her parents8217 bodies in oakland find a cemetery bury them sell their house give away their belongings and when she was done with it all she was still pregnant still aching with grief i want my baby she decided she never went back to new york she found an apartment in berkeley a waitressing job a daycare center when she yearned for her parents she gathered amanda in her arms instead she was the grownup now she was the mother over time when she thought about her parents her memories shifted in her mind like pieces in a kaleidoscope they reformed themselves reorganized rewrote her history she had only hazy memory of the fights with her father when she was a teenager8212about the way she dressed her politics the pot she smoked the bad boys she dated she forgot her anger at her mother for sending her to private school on a full scholarship8212her mother thought she would belong to this other world but instead she inhabited its shadowy fringes blair remembered rather cooking with her mother fishing with her father she remembered their sweet love for each other and how she felt blessed when she heard the horror stories of everyone8217s parents8217 divorces at home she was safe and when the world proved to be dangerous she secluded herself in the cocoon of her childhood home now she needed her mother her father she stood in the middle of the kitchen in her own cocoon this treehouse cottage and listened to the wail of the teakettle
