 1 an interrupted conversation the dog sensed them first dark as it was ian murray felt rather than saw rollo8217s head lift suddenly near his thigh ears pricking he put a hand on the dog8217s neck and felt the hair there ridged with warning so attuned as they were to each other he did not even think consciously 8220men8221 but put his other hand to his knife and lay still breathing listening the forest was quiet it was hours 8217til dawn and the air was still as that in a church with a mist like incense rising slowly up from the ground he had lain down to rest on the fallen trunk of a giant tulip tree preferring the tickle of woodlice to seeping damp he kept his hand on the dog waiting rollo was growling a low constant rumble that ian could barely hear but felt easily the vibration of it traveling up his arm arousing all the nerves of his body he hadn8217t been asleep8211he rarely slept at night anymore8211but had been quiet looking up into the vault of the sky engrossed in his usual argument with god quietness had vanished with rollo8217s movement he sat up slowly swinging his legs over the side of the halfrotted log heart beating fast now rollo8217s warning hadn8217t changed but the great head swiveled following something unseen it was a moonless night ian could see the faint silhouettes of trees and the moving shadows of the night but nothing more then he heard them sounds of passage a good distance away but coming nearer by the moment he stood and stepped softly into the pool of black under a balsam fir a click of the tongue and rollo left off his growling and followed silent as the wolf who had been his father ian8217s restingplace overlooked a game trail the men who followed it were not hunting white men now that was odd and more than odd he couldn8217t see them but didn8217t need to the noise they made was unmistakable indians traveling were not silent and many of the highlanders he lived among could move like ghosts in the wood8211but he had no doubt whatever metal that was it he was hearing the jingle of harness the clink of buttons and buckles8211and gun barrels a lot of them so close he began to smell them he leaned forward a little eyes closed the better to snuff up what clue he couldthey carried pelts now he picked up the driedblood coldfur smell that had probably waked rollo8211but not trappers surely too many trappers moved in ones and twospoor men and dirty not trappers and not hunters game was easy to come by at this season but they smelled of hunger and the sweat of bad drink close by now perhaps ten feet from the place where he stood rollo made a tiny snorting sound and ian closed his hand once more on the dog8217s ruff but the men made too much noise to hear it he counted the passing footsteps the bumping of canteens and bullet boxes footsore grunts and sighs of weariness twentythree men he made it and there was a mule8211no two mules with them he could hear the creak of laden panniers and that querulous heavy breathing the way a loaded mule did always on the verge of complaint the men would never have detected them but some freak of the air bore rollo8217s scent to the mules a deafening bray shattered the dark and the forest erupted in front of him with a clishmaclaver of crashing and startled shouts ian was already running when pistol shots crashed behind him 8220a dhia8221 something struck him in the head and he fell headlong was he killed no rollo was pushing a worried wet nose into his ear his head buzzed like a hive and he saw bright flashes of light before his eyes 8220run ruith8221 he gasped pushing at the dog 8220run out go8221 the dog hesitated whining deep in his throat he couldn8217t see but felt the big body lunge and turn turn back undecided 8220ruith8221 he got himself up onto hands and knees urging and the dog at last obeyed running as he had been trained there was no time to run himself even could he have gained his feet he fell facedown thrust hands and feet deep into the leaf mold and wriggled madly burrowing in a foot struck between his shoulder blades but the breath it drove out of him was muffled in wet leaves it didn8217t matter they were making so much noise whoever had stepped on him didn8217t notice it was a glancing blow as the man ran over him in panic doubtless thinking him a rotted log the shooting ceased the shouting didn8217t but he made no sense of it he knew he was lying flat on his face cold damp on his cheeks and the tang of dead leaves in his nose8211but felt as though very drunk the world revolving slowly round him his head didn8217t hurt much past the first burst of pain but he didn8217t seem able to lift it he had the dim thought that if he died here no one would know his mother would mind he thought not knowing what had become of him the noises grew fainter more orderly someone was still bellowing but it had the sound of command they were leaving it occurred to him dimly that he might call out if they knew he was white they might help him and they might not he kept quiet either he was dying or he wasn8217t if he was no help was possible if he wasn8217t none was needed well i asked then didn8217t i he thought resuming his conversation with god calm as though he lay still on the trunk of the tulip tree looking up into the depths of heaven above a sign i said i didna quite expect ye to be so prompt about it though 2 dutch cabin march 1773 no one had known the cabin was there until kenny lindsay had seen the flames on his way up the creek 8220i wouldna ha8217 seen at all8221 he said for perhaps the sixth time 8220save for the dark comin8217 on had it been daylight i8217d never ha8217 kent it never8221 he wiped a trembling hand over his face unable to take his eyes off the line of bodies that lay at the edge of the forest 8220was it savages mac dubh they8217re no scalped but maybe82118221 8220no8221 jamie laid the sootsmeared handkerchief gently back over the staring blue face of a small girl 8220none of them is wounded surely ye saw as much when ye brought them out8221 lindsay shook his head eyes closed and shivered convulsively it was late afternoon and a chilly spring day but the men were all sweating 8220i didna look8221 he said simply my own hands were like ice as numb and unfeeling as the rubbery flesh of the dead woman i was examining they had been dead for more than a day the rigor of death had passed off leaving them limp and chilled but the cold weather of the mountain spring had preserved them so far from the grosser indignities of putrefaction still i breathed shallowly the air was bitter with the scent of burning wisps of steam rose now and then from the charred ruin of the tiny cabin from the corner of my eye i saw roger kick at a nearby log then bend and pick up something from the ground beneath kenny had pounded on our door long before daylight summoning us from warm beds we had come in haste even knowing that we were far too late to offer aid some of the tenants from the homesteads on fraser8217s ridge had come too kenny8217s brother evan stood with fergus and ronnie sinclair in a small knot under the trees talking together in lowvoiced gaelic 8220d8217ye ken what did for them sassenach8221 jamie squatted beside me face troubled 8220the ones under the trees that is8221 he nodded at the corpse in front of me 8220i ken what killed this puir woman8221 the woman8217s long skirt stirred in the wind lifting to show long slender feet shod in leather clogs a pair of long hands to match lay still at her sides she had been tall8211though not so tall as brianna i thought and looked automatically for my daughter8217s bright hair bobbing among the branches on the far side of the clearing i had turned the woman8217s apron up to cover her head and upper body her hands were red roughknuckled with work and with callused palms but from the firmness of her thighs and the slenderness of her body i thought she was no more than thirty8211likely much younger no one could say whether she had been pretty i shook my head at his remark 8220i don8217t think she died of the burning8221 i said 8220see her legs and feet aren8217t touched she must have fallen into the hearth her hair caught fire and it spread to the shoulders of her gown she must have lain near enough to the wall or the chimney hood for the flames to touch that caught and then the whole bloody place went up8221 jamie nodded slowly eyes on the dead woman 8220aye that makes sense but what was it killed them sassenach the others are singed a bit though none are burned like this but they must have been dead before the cabin caught alight for none o8217 them ran out was it a deadly illness perhaps8221 8220i don8217t think so let me look at the others again8221 i walked slowly down the row of still bodies with their clothcovered faces stooping over each one to peer again beneath the makeshift shrouds there were any number of illnesses that could be quickly fatal in these days8211with no antibiotics to hand and no way of administering fluids save by mouth or rectum a simple case of diarrhea could kill within twentyfour hours i saw such things often enough to recognize them easily any doctor does and i had been a doctor for more than twenty years i saw things now and then in this century that i had never encountered in my own8211particularly horrible parasitical diseases brought with the slave trade from the tropics8211but it was no parasite that had done for these poor souls and no illness that i knew to leave such traces on its victims all the bodies8211the burned woman a much older woman and three children8211had been found inside the walls of the flaming house kenny had pulled them out just before the roof fell in then ridden for help all dead before the fire started all dead virtually at the same time then for surely the fire had begun to smolder soon after the woman fell dead on her hearth
