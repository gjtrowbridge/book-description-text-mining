 good girlsuch a good girl ellis said down on one knee as his dog snatched the beef treat from his open palm with a bite and a gulp the treat was gone and ellis belasco with his sleek copper red hair smiled proudly and added a strong authoritative pat to the back of his smoky brown pets neck as the trainer said attack dogs had to be rewarded p please my leg he chewed my leg the thin chinese man whined as he crawled across the worn beige carpet toward the hotel room door to be clear she chewed your achilles tendon ellis said calmly standing up and brushing back his long europeanstyle haircut he was always meticulous to reveal amber eyes framed by striking lush eyebrows that almost merged on the bridge of his nose because of his rosy coloring his cheeks were always flushed as were his full lips which he licked as he stared down at a small tattoo between his thumb and pointer finger his birthright was healing nicely for the past two months ellis had been tracking the ancient book from collector to collectorfrom the doctor in china whose death gave it away to zhao the shipper who schemed to deliver it elsewhere every culture called it by a different name but ellis knew the truth i know you have it ellis said id like the book of lies now from the corner of the bed ellis reached for his small gray pistol nonono you cant my fianceacutee we just got engaged the young dockworker begged scrambling on his one good knee as his other leg left a smear of blood across the carpet ellis pressed the barrel of his gun against the mans throat it was vital he hit the jugular but he knew he would that was the advantage of having god on your side i paid what you asked me zhao ellis said calmly but it makes me sad that someone else clearly paid you more i swearthe book i told you where its going zhao screamed his eyes rolling toward the pistol as ellis glanced out the hotel window into the dim alley the view was awful nothing more than a blank brick wall but that was why ellis had zhao meet him here no view no witnesses with a squeeze ellis shot him in the throat there was no bang just a pneumatic hiss zhao jerked slightly and his eyes blinked open ai ai that what was that he stuttered as a drop of blood bubbled from his neck the military called them jet injectors since world war i they had been used to vaccinate soldiers quickly and easily there was no needle the burst of air was so strong it drilled through the skin with nothing more than a disposable air cartridge and the one use red nozzle that looked like a thimble with a tiny hole all youd feel was the snap of a rubber band and the vaccine was in your blood for ellis it was a bit overdramatic but if he was to find the book that had been taken from him that had been taken from his family he knew every war had rules his great grandfather left him this gunor the plans for this gun at leastfor a reason it took time and patience to build it from scratch ellis had plenty of both forty thirty nine thirty eight ellis began to count peeking under the wrist of his starched shirt and checking his new ulysse nardin watch wait the shot whatd you put in me zhao screamed gripping the side of his neck thirty seven thirtysix thirtyfive ellis said his voice as serene as ever my family first encountered it in belgium conium maculatum hemlock are you you put hemlock you put a poison are you a fool now you get nothing zhao yelled fighting hard as he thrashed and crawled toward the door in a way zhao was right shooting him was a gamble but ellis knew its not a gamble when you know youll win after unscrewing the empty hemlock vial he replaced it with a vial filled with a cloudy yellow liquid i is that the antidote zhao asked it is isnt it ellis stepped back away from his victims reach do you know who mitchell siegel is zhao wh whatre you talking about thirty one thirty twenty nine in 1932 a man named mitchell siegel was shot in the chest and killed while mourning the death of his father his young son jerry came up with the idea of a bulletproof man that he nicknamed superman mid crawl zhaos feet stopped moving m my wh whatd you do to my legs ellis nodded and stood still to this day scientists didnt know why hemlock poisoning started in the feet and worked up from there such a dumb idea right zhaoa bulletproof man but the only reason superman was born was because a little boy missed his father ellis pointed out and the best part the murders still unsolved in fact people are still so excited by superman they never stop to ask just why mitchell siegel was killedor to even consider that maybe just maybe he mightve done something that made him the bad guy in this story twenty nineteen eighteen i cant feel my legs zhao sobbed as tears ran down his face you think im the bad guy here but im not ellis said putting away the empty vial zipping his leather doctors case and smoothing the sheets on the edge of the bed im the hero zhao youre the bad guy youre the one keeping the book of lies from us just like mitchell siegel kept it from us pplease i dont know who the hell youre talking about ellis crouched down next to zhao who was flat on his belly barely able to catch his breath i want my book tell me its final destination iii told you zhao stuttered wweits going to panama and then where thats it panama he repeated his nose pressed to the carpet his eyes clenched in pain just the antidote you feel that tightening in your waist ellis asked looking down and realizing that his shoes could use a new shine your thighs are dead zhao then itll climb to your testicles hemlock is what killed socrates he narrated his entire deathhow it slithered from his waist to his chest right up to when his eyes were fixed and dilated okay okayokayokay miami after panama theyre its going to miami in florida zhao insisted the sheet the lading bill its i swear its in my pocket just make it stop ellis reached into zhaos pocket and extracted the sheet of light pink paper that held all the details of the shipments arrival seven six five the dog began to growl she could smell death coming but ellis ignored the noise peacefully reading from the bill of lading the containers new tracking number the receivers name had to be fake everything the leadership needed four three two still flat on his stomach and now with his mouth wide open zhao gave a final hollow gasp that sounded like the last bits of water being sucked down a drain elliss great grandfather described the same sound in his diaryright after he mentioned there was no antidote for hemlock poisoning one zhao was niceeven kind when they first met at the doctors funeralbut the mission was bigger than zhao and based on what happened in 1900 with mitchell siegel the mission had enough problems with witnesses zhaos tongue went limp and his head slumped forward sending his forehead against the carpet ellis didnt notice he was already on his phone dialing judge wojtowiczs number i told you not to call me here eddie answered an older man with a soft crackly voice ellis im called ellis now he replied never losing his composure he spread out his left hand admiring the tattoo its five in the morning here ellis what do you

family names dont get you into harvard anymore what makes you think theyll get you in here there was a long pause on the line i appreciate your helping us with this ellis the judge finally offered clearing his throat he added youre close to finding the book arent you and about to get even closer ellis said glancing at the pink bill of lading and studying the containers new tracking details when it left the port when itd arrive in miami even the truck driver who was responsible for the pickup harper lloyd cmon benoni he murmured to the dog he knew it was an odd name benoni but according to the diaries that was the name of abels watchdog the dog that was eventually given to cain and the only witness to the worlds first murder youre in for a treat girl he said as he stepped over zhaos dead body and led the dog out into the hallway this time of year the weather is gorgeous in florida as the dog ran ahead ellis never lost sight of her he knew his history only with benoni would he find the book of lies and solve the true mystery of the worlds greatest villain
