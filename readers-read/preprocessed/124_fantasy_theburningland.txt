 the rush of water caught gyalo full in the chest it felt completely real he gasped and leaped aside before he could stop himself brushing at his face and clothes even as he did he understood the trick and straightened up again angry at himself for being taken in he thought he could see the one who had done it a skinny postulant with the yellow headband of a trainee shaper leaning over the back of a passing parade cart and grinning in gyalo8217s direction packed in around him other trainees tossed blessings to the crowd a shower of spangles streamers of transparent gauze a burst of rainbow brilliance these were not true shapings which changed and shifted matter and properly could be performed only in the context of acircratist ceremony but illusions substanceless manipulations of light and air a symbolic reminder of the sacred power bestowed by the god on humankind before time began they vanished even as the spectators laughed and snatched at them the water had not been entirely illusory though gyalo could feel dampness on his cheeks and the fine golden silk of his shaper stole was spotted with wet under other circumstances he might have seen the humor in itthe people nearby clearly did though in deference to his shaperhood they hid their smiles behind their handsbut he had spent time and care dressing himself and so he was not amused 8220here brother8221 one of the bystanders a young arsacian woman offered him her stole 8220for your face8221 she spoke shyly but laughter twitched the corners of her mouth well gyalo thought it was funny ruefully he smiled at her and took the stole 8220thanks for your charity lady8221 he said giving it back into her hands 8220hopefully i can manage to keep dry the rest of the way8221 she giggled 8220great is acircrata8221 she said making the god8217s sign 8220great is his way8221 8220go in light8221 gyalo moved on to his left the spectators were a mass of packed bodies and laughing faces to his right the procession trundled along an exuberant juggernaut of color noise and smell oxdrawn parade carts festooned with ribbons dyed in the god8217s colors groups of forceless monks on foot beating drums and blowing kanshas great trumpets that curved over the shoulder and made a sound like a mythic beast dying in agony drays bearing huge woodandgilt statues of acircrata in his four guises of worldcreator primal warrior eonsleeper and risen judge litters with smaller images of some of acircrata8217s more powerful aspectsdacircdarshi patron of luck skambys patron of war and weather hatacircspa patron of fire and weaponry tane patron of crops and the mooncarried by hymnsinging devoteepriests between these groups walked postulants with rods of burning incense and more monks shouting out rhythmically 8220wake o acircrata wake wake and deliver your children from exile8221 like the blessings the cacophony was symbolic no one imagined that all this noise could actually rouse the god it was meant for the human spectators to remind them of the waiting that was their lot that had been the lot of every living creature since acircrata first lay down to sleep it echoed deafeningly back from the high blood granite walls that enclosed the avenue gyalo8217s ears rang from it and his eyes burned from incense smoke another day he might have ducked through one of the archways that gave access to the tangled side streets in search of a less crowded way to go but though he had long known baushpar8217s plan by heart he had never actually set foot in the holy city until six months earlier and the map in his head did not always guide him properly he could not risk today of all days getting lost which reminded him with unwelcome sharpness that he was nervous the avenue terminated upon a vast walled square paved in russet ironstone at whose center rose the monumental bulk of the first temple of acircrata the temple8217s original core had been erected more than eleven centuries before but it had been expanded many times since then in a score or more of different styles and motifs lent harmony by the yellow honey granite of which the whole was made images and carvings covered every inch of the huge faccedilade worn to varying degrees of featurelessness by time and weather but here and there where the construction was newer or there was protection from the elements showing sharper and more perfect above it all a dozen domes reached toward the sky like fat lotus buds about to open recently regilded they reflected light even on this overcast day when the sun shone they were blinding gyalo had been raised on tales of the first temple8217s magnificence and it justified the stories in every respect even marred by decades of neglect and the more substantial depredations of the caryaxists who had helped themselves to floor tiles and wall inlays and anything made of metal and scraped all the gold leaf off the image of acircrata eonsleeper that reclined at the temple8217s circular core still the temple was too huge andeven for the caryaxiststoo sacred to be razed or ruined as other temples and shrines and monasteries all over arsace had been it rested on the ironstone paving a golden island atop a russet sea as colossal and serene as the dreaming god himself gyalo and the procession parted companythe procession moving left preparing to round the temple gyalo turning right toward the square8217s western side the spectators made way for him dipping their heads respectfully and making the sign of acircrata as he passed elsewhere the square was thickly populated by food vendors and offeringssellers but there were none here the western wall marked the boundary of the evening city a labyrinth of courts and offices and suites that from the first days of the church had been the seat of the acircratist leadership for the past eighty years it had stood empty for the caryaxist rebellion had sent the brethren into exile but the caryaxists were gone now and the sons and daughters had taken back their home the red gate at the wall8217s midpoint was unlockedmeant not to bar entry but to remind those who passed through it of the separateness of the men and women who lived on its other side it gave onto a long courtyard paved in the same ironstone as the square at the court8217s far end a pavilion with a yellowtiled roof marked the entrance to the evening city four guards stood duty inside clad in the white stoles of the forceless and displaying on their arms and cheeks the sinuous tattoos of ordinates from the kingdom of kanutapa where skambys patron of war was the most important of the aspects and martial arts were part of acircratist training behind them rose two great sets of vermilionpainted doors those on the left which gave access to the offices where administrative work was done were open those on the right were closed beyond them lay the living quarters of the brethren where no one went without permission gyalo approached the guards8217 leader he came here daily in his capacity as aide to the son utamnos the guards all knew him a fact they acknowledged now by ignoring him completely this time though his purpose was different 8220i have a summons8221 by custom he spoke arsacian the common language of the church 8220from the bearer8221 the leader8217s bored superior expression did not change he took the message cylinder gyalo offered and scanned the paper inside turning he nodded to one of his subordinates who disappeared through the righthand doors the leader handed the summons back to gyalo and withdrew his attention again as thoroughly as if gyalo had ceased to exist under other circumstances gyalo might have been annoyed at this display of tapati arrogance but today he was too distracted his apprehension flowed through him like water it was unexpected this anxietynot the feeling itself for given the identity of his summoner some degree of nervousness was to be expected but its acuteness had not utamnos warning him to expect the summons told him that its purpose would honor him yet utamnos either could not or would not reveal what the purpose was giving him instead a list of documents to read in preparation accounts of the caryaxist occupation descriptions of thuxra city the small body of writings on the burning land over the past four days the mystery had become more and more oppressive now waiting in the pavilion with only the disdainful guards for company gyalo felt nearly ill with accumulated stress the guard returned another forceless monk behind him the monk scrutinized gyalo8217s summons and tucked it into a pocket of his gown 8220come8221 he said he led the way through the doors on the right into rooms and corridors familiar to gyalo from his visits to utamnos8217s private suite and then into regions gyalo did not know everywhere was magnificence both intactastonishing floormosaics intricately carved columns and doorframes gorgeously stenciled ceilings majestic galleries flanked by graveled courtsand marreddefaced murals derelict gardens ruined atriums shattered carvings the caryaxists had been great graffitists and the returning acircratist leadership had found much of the evening city decorated with revolutionary slogans and lewd cartoons despite the priority given to the removal of these a few still remained ugly scrawlings in red paint like blood yellow paint like bile acircrata8217s colors used to mock him gyalo8217s guide delivered him at last into a large chamber with a coffered ceiling and a floor of red tile 8220wait here8221 he directed and departed gyalo paced the length of the room halting before the windows they faced onto a small gardennot overgrown like many of those he had just passed but exquisitely restored with clipped shrubs and carefully raked gravel paths the warm air smelled of roses he closed his eyes and breathed deeply seeking calm he was aware of the beating of his heart the ebb and flow of his apprehension there were footsteps behind him he turned a man in white and crimson clothes was passing through the doorway followed by two tapati guards and a teenage boy the man towered above all three of his companions he moved with the swift forceful stride of someone who assumed without considering it that he would be made way for gyalo had seen this man many timeshad heard him speak many times too in rich tones that made all words beautifulbut always from a distance always surrounded by scores even hundreds of others he had never at this point in his career thought to stand solitary before the blood bearer incarnate son of acircrata8217s first messenger and elected leader of the acircratist church he came forward and sank to his knees on the cool tiles he bowed his head crossing his hands before his face and said in a voice that shook only a little 8220great is acircrata great is his way8221 8220go in light8221 the bearer replied 8220get up8221 gyalo obeyed the bearer was about forty years of age with broad handsome features and heavylidded eyes an intricate image of the sun acircrata8217s symbol was tattooed in red upon his forehead he had the tawny skin and heavy bone structure common in the kingdom of haruko where he had been born in this incarnation the great weight of muscle he carried was apparent in his corded neck and wide shoulders and the round hard sinews of his right arm left bare by the traditional draping of his white stole like all vowed acircratists he kept his chin and skull cleanshaven and wore the monk8217s uniform of loose trousers and kneelength sleeveless gownthough his were made of lustrous red silk rather than gyalo8217s plain linen or the coarse cotton worn by the forceless on the bearer8217s chest rested the badge of his office a thick gold chain with a pendant cage of gold wire inside which gleamed a honeycolored jewel as large as a man8217s clenched fist the blood of acircrata the blood was round in shape and naturally faceted a core of living flame seemed to dance at its heart all vowed acircratists wore a smaller simulacrum of this necklace hidden beneath their clothing but the most cleverly crafted of these could only suggest the splendor of the original if gyalo had not known what the jewel was he would still have sensed its sacredness in that shuddering brilliance that was unlike anything else in the worldso much more beautiful and so much stranger than was apparent from a distance 8220your master told you to expect this summons yes8221 with difficulty gyalo wrenched his attention away from the jewel 8220yes old one8221 8220your master holds you in high esteem8221 the bearer8217s eyes moved across gyalo8217s face as if measuring him against that assessment 8220he tells me that he relies on you beyond any of his other aides8221 gyalo bowed his head 8220his confidence honors me old one8221 8220come8221 the bearer turned and strode toward the chair his guards had brought forward and placed at the center of the room gyalo followed halting a little distance away and arranging himself in a posture of respect his eyes cast down and his hands clasped before him he was conscious of the guards at the bearer8217s back and of the boy kneeling quietly on the floor at the bearer8217s feet the boy was also harukoborn paler of skin than the bearer but with the same strong bones and heavylidded almond eyes his black hair hung loose and he wore the plain white tunic and trousers of a postulant but the sun tattoo on his forehead and of course his presence marked him for what he truly was another incarnate son too young yet to take up the burdens of leadership but old enough to observe his elders in the performance of their duties infant sons and daughters were given to the adult brethren to raise as their own this boy vimata was both the bearer8217s spiritbrother and his foster child 8220tell me about yourself8221 the bearer said 8220where were you born8221 8220in rimpang old one8221 rimpang capital of the kingdom of chonggye was home to the largest acircratist center in galea after baushpar the brethren had taken refuge there upon their flight from the caryaxist rebellion 8220my mother was a cook in one of the convents she died when i was seven the nuns gave me to the monks to raise8221 8220had you no other family8221 8220my father but he was a soldier and stationed elsewhere there were only the monks to take me in8221 the bearer shifted in his chair crossing one leg over the other his broad face was attentive as if he were hearing these things for the first time gyalo had no doubt however that the bearer already knew everything that was to be known about him this recital was in some way a test 8220did your father ever return8221 8220yes old one about a year after my mother died he wanted me to have a military career not a religious one he demanded that i be taken from the monastery and given to him the monks told me i could choose and that if i wanted to stay they would honor my wishes i decided to stay my father was angryhe tried to get the courts to intervene he even petitioned the overlord of rimpang province but then he was called away he never came back i heard later that he died in the jingya epidemics8221 8220why did you decide to stay you didn8217t yet know you were a shaper and you were very youngtoo young surely to know what you desired for the rest of your life8221 8220from the time i can remember old one acircrata has called me one of the earliest memories i have is of the rimpang temple corethe image of acircrata creator the incense and the candles the offerings and the silence i loved the silencei thought i could feel the god within it i think i always wanted to vow the way though i never truly understood that until my father tried to make me a soldier8221 8220you would have come to the way in any case being what you are whether your father wished it or not8221 8220yes old one but most shapers never choose their servicethey are chosen by their ability but i did choose before ever i knew what i was i feel blessed to have been granted that chance8221 the bearer studied gyalo at his feet vimata gravely echoed his spiritbrother8217s attention the bearer8217s heavylidded gaze was extraordinarily direct and also extraordinarily opaque gyalo could feel the force of the powerful personality behind it he could see the ancient intelligence that lived in those eyes but he could not begin to guess what the bearer might be thinking 8220go on8221 the bearer said 8220you became a postulant then8221 8220yes old one i completed my training and swore the sixfold vow i was assigned to work in rimpang library while i studied for my shaper ordination after i was ordained i took the administrative examinations the son utamnos selected me from the position lists i served him for five years in rimpang and for the past six months here in baushpar8221 8220you give a very brief account of yourself i understand your exam scores were extraordinary8221 8220i was told so old one8221 8220come now no false modesty8221 the bearer smiled a little 8220my brother utamnos informs me that you have an acute grasp of your own abilities8221 gyalo felt himself flush 8220i do know my strengths old one i try to know my weaknesses also8221 8220ah8221 the bearer picked up the jewel on his chest his blunt fingers caressing the wire of its cage in an absent habitual gesture 8220it is quite a skill to understand one8217s weaknesses most people have some notion of their talents but few know their failings half so well and often it is an ignorance deliberately cultivated8221 gyalo could not take his eyes off the bearer8217s fingers probing gently at the golden lattice what was it like to touch the blood of acircrata did it radiate warmth like the blood it had been or chill like the crystal it had become did the god8217s divinity resonate in it as his immanence did in the silence of his temples or had its nearness grown so familiar that the bearer no longer noticed such things there was an offhand quality to his gesture that suggested this the bearer8217s brows were raised again gyalo struggled to rein in his thoughts 8220i agree old one8221 he said 8220i strive to avoid selfdeception8221 8220according to utamnos you are unusually diligent in that regard he says you turn toward the truth even when it is painful for you to do so8221 the bearer paused 8220he also tells me that your manita dose is unusually high8221 this time gyalo felt his face go scarlet 8220then he must have told you old one8221 he said carefully 8220that my dose is stable and has been for some time now8221 8220indeed and that prior to its stabilization you never attempted to abuse your shaping unlike some who require frequent dosage adjustment that you yourself approached him in fact when you sensed your tether had become inadequate8221 8220yes old one as any shaper should8221 8220and yet other shapers have fallen into apostasy that way those with naturally strong abilities especially find it difficult to accept the limitation of the drug haven8217t you been tempted8221 the room seemed to have grown very still the bearer8217s eyes gleamed unblinking as a hawk8217s the jewel with which he no longer toyed shone on his broad chest like a tiny sun beside him his spiritbrother was an attentive shadow gyalo understood with sure instinct that this was not just another question a turning point of some sort had been reached 8220when i started my shaper training old one8221 he began carefully 8220i did resent manita8217s grip upon my shaping because of that and also out of curiosity i did things i shouldn8217t have done experimented with my ability in ways i knew were forbidden i won8217t excuse myself by saying i was only a boy or that i hadn8217t yet taken the shaper vow or that most trainee shapers do the same i knew the doctrine of baushpar i knew the words of my teachers and so i knew it was wrong that should have been enough8221 he drew a breath images of that time stirred uncomfortably in memory if he tried he could still recapture the ghost of the desire that had driven him the breathless mix of shame and guilt and excitement his secret explorations had produced it was not easy to talk of this his preceptor in rimpang had known and he had confessed to utamnos early in their association but to no one else 8220as i grew older and my understanding of the way of acircrata deepened it did become enough but i cannot liei was still curious and it wasn8217t always faith that kept me pure but only will then i was put to work in rimpang library i have an interest in the past in the history of the church i came upon the firsthand accounts of the shaper war i8217d never seen such documentsall i knew of the war was the texts that are given in the postulant classes i read them all every account i could find and i came to understandnot just to accept through my training or to hold through my vows but to truly understand the need for limitation shaping freed to human will to human desire is a terrible anarchy those who follow it in that way don8217t care for what it is but only for what it can do they may begin by acknowledging its sacredness but always they grow corrupt and end by pursuing greed and gain and down that road lies catastrophe 8220so my answer to your question old one is this the cure for desire is knowledge i see that road too clearly now ever to set my feet upon it since that time i have not been tempted8221 the bearer8217s eyes held his for a moment there was silence then the bearer smiledfully this time though his eyes remained hooded beside him vimata smiled also a graceful mirror 8220your master promised you would impress me8221 he said 8220he was correct8221 gyalo bowed his head he felt as if he had stood in the path of a whirlwind and been passed over you honor me old one8221 8220to business then8221 the bearer shifted again in his chair a restlessness that did not suggest impatience so much as the driving demand of an energy too great to be held still 8220obviously i haven8217t called you here just to question you i understand your master has set you to reading the accounts of that abomination thuxra city8221 8220yes old one8221 thuxra city was a prison built by the caryaxist government ten years after the uprising that brought it to power as part of its transition from egalitarian revolution to authoritarian state over the years as hardening ideology and popular unrest bred escalating repression thuxra grew to enormous proportions in addition to political prisoners and ordinary people accused of a wide variety of anticommunal offenses many vowed acircratists were confined there monks and nuns who defied secularization orders or were found to have taken vows in secret or were discovered in more active forms of resistance such as smuggling dissidents to safety across arsace8217s borders thuxra stood on the far side of the massive range of mountains known as the range of clouds at the edge of the burning land there were many practical reasons to build a prison in such a hostile and isolated place where escape meant death and only the prisoners and those who guarded them knew exactly what went on inside but it was ideology that had caused the caryaxists to situate thuxra in acircrata8217s sacred landa deliberate defilement of holy ground a powerful demonstration of their contempt for the acircratist traditions that for centuries had kept the burning land inviolate disturbed only by pilgrims and holy men one of the brethren8217s most urgent priorities was thuxra8217s dismantlement 8220before thuxra8221 the bearer said 8220caryaxist officials used arsace8217s existing prisons to hold vowed acircratists whom they did not choose to execute or secularize sometimes though to save space and also because it was consideredappropriate vowed acircratists were banished directly into the burning land8221 gyalo drew in his breath 8220i8217d thought that was only a rumor old one8221 8220unfortunately very little of what we heard about the caryaxists during our exile in rimpang has turned out to be rumor the faithful were marched over the mountains stripped naked and chased out into the land any who attempted to return were killed8221 the bearer smiled this time with singular grimness 8220it8217s all documented they were dedicated recordkeepers the caryaxists 8220the practice ceased once thuxra was built for the caryaxists discovered the land could be mined and it was more profitable to keep all their prisoners alive for labor it was assumed of course that the banished acircratists had perished it8217s a deadly environment even for a man at full strength which those poor souls most certainly were not however8221 the bearer paused 8220for some decades now our dreamers have been dreaming of something odd deep inside the land they are vague these dreamsthe dreamers can8217t even say really what it is they sense it8217s there though where nothing ever was before some sort ofdisturbance far out in the wastes until recently not knowing a great deal about what was going on inside arsace we had no reason to assume it was anything but naturalvolcanic eruption or something of the sort but now with the records available to us we think it might be humanor more precisely the exercise of a human power8221 8220do you mean8221 gyalo was incredulous 8220do you mean to say there are survivors8221 8220we think it8217s possible8221 8220but how the land is waterless there8217s nothing to eat nothing to live on8221 8220in the book of the messenger it8217s written that the messenger was nourished on the food of the gods and the nectar of paradise when he followed acircrata8217s dream into the wastes it seems those things may not have been entirely miraculous there is sustenance in the land and water for those who know how to find themthe caryaxists discovered this during their time at thuxra as they pushed outward in search of gems and copper and gold on the other hand8221 again the bearer paused 8220the records show that only dreamers and forceless were banished in this way whatever else you may say about the caryaxists they weren8217t foolsthey understood the risk of unbound shaping which is why they were so relentless in pursuit of them but suppose a shaper or perhaps more than one decided to pass himself off as forceless to save his life and was taken along with the others8221 8220and without manita8221 8220exactly8221 gyalo was silent considering this possibilitythat shapers released from the tether of manita and forced into the burning land had used their ability to save themselves and that their descendants had survived there had been many shaper apostasies over the course of acircratist history particularly during the centuries just after the shaper war and the formulation of the doctrine of baushpar as the church took steps to gather shaping to itself but they had been quickly discovered and dealt with even the most vigorous had lasted no more than a decade this desert community on the other hand would have existed for seventy or more yearstwo possibly three generations without manita it was a staggering idea 8220so you believe that shaping is causing the disturbances the dreamers have dreamed old one8221 the bearer shook his head 8220truly at this point all is speculation we know nothing for certain not even that there were shapers to begin with but whatever the truth may be we must discover it we cannot tolerate the possibility that human beings may languish in such dreadful exilenor can we countenance such a disturbance of acircrata8217s sacred resting place if there are survivors they must be found and brought back to arsace8221 gyalo felt as if the floor had just shifted very slightly beneath his feet the events of the past daysthe summons the reading utamnos8217s evasivenessfell abruptly into place inside his mind 8220a rescue expedition8221 he said 8220yes king santaxma in his generosity has agreed to equip it and also to provide a military staff we must be grateful for his majestys eagerness to aid the church in this urgent matter8221 one would not guess from the formality of the bearer8217s manner that he and santaxma were fast friends and had been so since childhood santaxma was the scion of the only branch of the arsacian royal family to survive the massacre that brought the caryaxists to power he and the bearer had grown up side by side in rimpang dreaming a shared dream of arsacian freedom they came to power together also santaxma crowned kinginexile only a few months after the bearer8217s election together they embarked upon the fulfillment of their vision santaxma raising men the bearer raising money now santaxma reigned again in arsace and the brethren ruled once more in baushpara dual restoration but a single triumph 8220know8221 the bearer said 8220that this decision has not been lightly made we detest the necessity of intruding upon the god8217s rest but acircrata has already been disturbed over and over by the death and suffering the caryaxists brought into his sacred landand by these survivors if indeed that is what they are we will add only briefly to his disquiet and when we are finished his peace will be entirely restored the god who created us who made us out of his own bright nature would not expect us to set tradition above service when so great a wrong may need to be put right8221 8220i understand old one8221 8220i suspect you also understand that you are to be part of the expedition8221 it was true even so to hear it spoken stole gyalo8217s breath 8220i will do my best to serve old one8221 the bearer raised his brows 8220you sound uncertain8221 8220i confess old onei do not understand why i have been chosen8221 8220how so8221 8220i8217m a chonggye ordinate old one i8217ve lived almost all my life in rimpang my knowledge is of history and administration i have no martial training and barely any familiarity with travel i wonder that you would not want someonemore experienced8221 8220you are physically strong that8217s clear to look at you you8217re a competitive runner i believe8221 8220i was old one it8217s been some time since i competed8221 8220the point is that you are fit and accustomed to endurance martial matters needn8217t concern youthat is what the soldiers are for as for experienceno one has experience of the sort of journey you will be undertaking in that you are at no greater disadvantage than the others8221 he watched gyalo a moment shrewdly 8220your doubt is natural but know that a great deal of care has gone into planning this expedition you will be leaving from thuxra city as the lost acircratists did you will have a man from thuxra to show you the ways of survival in the burning land the soldiers will cope with the practical aspects of traveland other areas in which their skills may be needed there will be dreamers to serve as guides there will be forceless to help you prepare those you may find for return to arsace and there will be you a shaper to maintain the requirements of ritual to supervise the other acircratists to record the journeyand if necessary to provide a historical perspective on shaper apostasy from your close knowledge of the shaper war so as you can see it8217s not for your knowledge of a sword or your travel skills that you8217ve been chosen8221 gyalo bowed his head 8220i understand old one thank you8221 8220the soldiers will arrive within the fortnight so if you8217ve any outstanding business take care of it now my sister sundit is overseeing the travel plans she8217ll summon you for briefing in the next day or so8221 8220yes old one8221 8220in the meantime don8217t speak of this to anyone other than the brethrennot even to your fellow aides the purpose of this expedition is not generally known we do not wish to stir more speculation than we must8221 8220i understand old one8221 8220come8221 the bearer stretched out his right arm his powerful muscles flexing 8220i will give you my blessing8221 gyalo approached and sank to his knees bowing his face so that all he could see was the gleaming silk of the bearer8217s trousers and the upturned toes of his embroidered indoor shoes the bearer8217s hand descended upon his head the palm wide and warm against his shaven scalp the fingers easily encircling his skull it was a gentle grip but he could feel the leashed power of it the weight of flesh and bone in the arm above 8220go in light child of acircrata vowed servant of the god may your bright nature lead you forward and your ashnature follow after you may the light of acircrata overflow your soul and the darkness of the enemy never trouble you may your faith guide you and your obedience keep you and your compassion lend you strength these are all the tools you need in the name of acircrata in the name of his first messenger in the name of his church by the power of his sacred blood i give you blessing go in light child of acircrata vowed servant of the god8221 the bearer8217s fingers tightened briefly then withdrew but it seemed to gyalo that he could still feel the burden of that great handa metaphorical burden now of expectation and purpose the sinews of his neck ached with tension he rocked back onto the balls of his feet and stood 8220thank you old one8221 8220journey well brother gyalo8221 the bearer8217s hand had descended to lie lightly upon vimatas sleek black head 8220go in light8221 gyalo bowed 8220great is acircrata great is his way one of the tapati guards led him back through evening city
