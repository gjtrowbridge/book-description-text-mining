 chapter 1 louis wu louis wu woke aflame with new life under a coffin lid displays glowed above his eyes bone composition blood parameters deep reflexes urea and potassium and zinc balance he could identify most of these the damage listed wasnt great punctures and gouges fatigue torn ligaments and extensive bruises two ribs cracked all relics of the battle with the vampire protector bram all healed now the doc would have rebuilt him cell by cell hed felt dead and cooling when he climbed into the intensive care cavity eightyfour days ago the display said sixtyseven ringworld days almost a falan a falan was ten ringworld rotations seventyfive thirtyhour days twenty or thirty days should have healed him but hed known he was injured what with all the general bruising from the battle with bram he hadnt even noticed puncture wounds in his back hed been under repair for twice that long the first time he lay in this box then his internal plumbing systems had been leaking into each other and hed been eleven years without the longevity complex called boosterspice hed been dying and old testosterone was high adrenalin high and rising louis pushed steadily up against the lid of the doc the lid wouldnt move faster but his body craved action he slid out and dropped to a stone floor cold beneath his bare feet stone he was naked he stood in a vast cavern where was needle the interstellar spacecraft hot needle of inquiry had been embedded in cooled magma when last he looked and carlos wus experimental nanotech repair system had been in the crew quarters now its components sat within a nest of instruments and cables on a floor of cooled lava the doc had been partly pulled apart everything was still running hubristic massive awesome this was a protectors work tunesmith the ghoul protector must have been studying the doc while it healed louis nearby hot needle of inquiry had been fileted like a finless fish a slice of hull running almost nose to tail had been cut away exposing housing cargo space docking for a lander now destroyed thruster plates and the hyperdrive motor housing more than half of the ships volume was tanks and of course theyd been drained the rim of the cut had been lined with copper or bronze and cables in the metal led to instruments and a generator the cut section had been pulled aside by massive machinery the cut surface was rimmed in bronze laced with cables the hyperdrive motor had run the length of the ship now it was laid out on the lava in a nest of instruments tunesmith again louis wandered over to look it had been repaired louis had stranded the hindmost in ringworld space by chopping the hyperdrive in half twelve or thirteen years ago dismounted it looked otherwise ready to take needle between the stars at quantum i speeds three days to the light year i could go home louis thought tasting the notion where is everybody louis looked around him feeling the adrenalin surge he was starting to shiver with cold hed be almost two hundred and forty years old by now wouldnt he easy to lose track here but the nano machines in carlos wus experimental doc had read his dna and repaired everything down through the cell nuclei louis had done this dance before his body thought it was just past puberty keep it cool boy nobodys challenged you yet the spacecraft the hull section the doc machines to move and repair these masses and crudelooking instruments arrayed to study them all formed a tight cluster within vaster spaces the cavern was tremendous and nearly empty louis saw float plates like stacks of poker chips and beyond those a tilted tower of tremendous toroids that ran through a gap in the floor right up to the roof cylinders lay near the gap caged within more of tunesmiths machinery they were bigger than needle each a little different from the others hed passed through this place once before louis looked up knowing what to expect five or six miles up he thought the map of mars stood forty miles high this level would be near the roof louis could make out its contours think of it as the back of a mask the mask of a shield volcano the size of ceres needle had smashed down through the crater in mons olympus into the repair center that underlay the onetoone scale map of mars teela brown had trapped them there after she turned protector she had moved the ship eight hundred miles through these corridors then poured molten rock around them theyd used stepping disks the puppeteers instant transport system to reach teela for all these years since the ship had been trapped now tunesmith had brought it back to the workstation under mons olympus louis knew tunesmith but not well louis had set a trap for tunesmith the night person the breeder and tunesmith had become a protector hed watched tunesmith fight bram and that was about all he knew of tunesmith the protector now tunesmith held louiss life in his hands and it was louiss own doing hed be smarter than louis trying to outguess a protector was futz was both silly and inevitable no human culture has ever stopped trying to outguess god so needle was an interstellar spacecraft if someone could remount the hyperdrive that tremendous tilted tower forty miles of it if it reached all the way to the repair center floor was a linear accelerator a launching system one day tunesmith might need a spacecraft meanwhile hed leave needle gutted because louis wu and the hindmost might otherwise use it to run and the protector couldnt have that louis walked until needle loomed a hundredandtenfoot diameter cylinder with a flattened belly not much of the ship was missing the hyperdrive the doc what else the crew housing was a cross section its floor eighty feet up under the floor all of the kitchen and recycling systems were exposed if he could climb that high hed have his breakfast and clothing too he didnt see any obvious route maybe there was a stepping disk link but he couldnt guess where tunesmith might place a stepping disk or where it would lead the hindmosts command deck was exposed too it was three stories tall with lower ceilings than a kzin would need louis saw how he could climb up to the lowest floor a protector would have no trouble at all louis shook his head what must the hindmost be thinking piersons puppeteers held to a millionyearold philosophy based on cowardice when the hindmost built needle he had isolated his command deck from any intruders even from his own alien crew there were no doors at all just stepping disks boobytrapped a thousand ways now the puppeteer must feel as naked as louis louis crouched beneath the edge of some flattopped mass maybe the breathingair system leapt pulled up and kept climbing the docs repairs had left him thin almost gaunt he wasnt lifting much weight fifty feet up he hung by his fingers for a moment this was the lowest floor of the hindmosts cabin his most private area there would be defenses tunesmith might have turned them off or not he pulled up and was in forbidden space he saw the hindmost then he saw his own droud sitting on a table the droud was the connector between any wall socket and louis wus brain louis had destroyed that had given it to chmeee and watched the kzin batter it to bits so a replacement bait for louis wu the current addict the wirehead louiss hand crept into the hair at the back of his head under the queue plug in the droud let it trickle electric current down into the pleasure center where was the socket louis laughed wildly it wasnt there the autodocs nano machines had rebuilt his skull without a socket for the droud louis thought it over then he took the droud when confused send a confusing message the hindmost lay like a jeweled footstool his three legs and both heads tucked protectively beneath his torso louiss lips curled he stepped forward to sink his hand into the jeweled mane and shake the puppeteer out of his funk touch nothing louis flinched violently the voice was a blast of contralto music the hindmosts voice with the sound turned up and it spoke interworld whatever you desire it said instruct me touch nothing the hindmosts voice needle s autopilot knew him knew his language at least and hadnt killed him louis found his own voice were you expecting me yes i give you limited freedom in this place find a current source next to no breakfast louis said as his belly suddenly screamed that it was empty dying i need food there is no kitchen for your kind here a shallow ramp wound round the walls to the upper floors ill be back louis said he walked then ran up the ramp he eased around the wall above a drop of eighty feet not difficult just scary and was in crew quarters a pit showed where the doc had been removed crew quarters were not otherwise changed the plants were still alive louis went to the kitchen wall and dialed cappuccino and a fruit plate he ate he dressed pants and blouse and a vest that was all pockets the droud bulging one of the pockets he finished the fruit then dialed up an omelet potatoes another cappuccino and a waffle he thought while he ate what was his desire wake the hindmost he needed the hindmost to tell him what was going on but puppeteers were manipulative and secretive and the balance of power in the repair center kept changing best learn more first get a little leverage before he reached for the truth he dumped the breakfast dishes in the recycler toilet he climbed around the wall carefully hindmosts voice he said at your command you need not risk a fall here is a steppingdisk link and a cursor arrowhead showed him a spot on the floor of crew quarters show me the meteor defense room that term is unknown a hologram window popped up in the portside wall is this the place you mean meteor defense beneath the map of mars was a vast dark space all the stars in the universe ran round an ellipsoidal wall thirty feet high and the floor and ceiling three long swinging booms ended in chairs equipped with lap keyboards and those stood blackonblack before the wall display past the edge of the popup window under a glare of light knobby bones had been laid out for study this was the oldest protector louis knew of and louis had named him cronus in the far shadows stood pillars with large plates on top mechanical mushrooms louis pointed into the window what are those service stacks the hindmosts voice said each made from several float plates topped by a stepping disk louis nodded the ringworld engineers had left float plates all through the repair center if you stacked them theyd lift more adding a stepping disk seemed an obvious refinement if you had them to spare louis saw a boom swing across the starscape it ended in a knobby angular shadow all protectors look something like medieval armor the protector was watching a spray of stars his cameras would be mounted on the ringworld itself maybe on the outside of the rim wall looking away from the sun he didnt seem aware that he was being spied on louis knew better than to expect asteroids or worlds unknown engineers had cleared all that out of the ringworld system this drift of moving lights would be spacecraft held by several species now the view focused on a gauzy fragile outsider ship now on a glass needle a general products 2 hull tenant unknown now a crowbarshaped arm warship tunesmiths concentration seemed total he zoomed on starscape occluded by a foggy lump a protocomet tiny angular machines drifted around it marked by blinking cursor circles a lance of light glared much brighter some warships fusion drive here came another zipping across the screen no weapon fired the fringe war is still cold louis thought hed wondered how long that could last a formal truce could not hold among so many different minds the protectors arms jittered above the keyboard in the corner of louiss eye sunlight glared down louis spun around above needle the crater in mons olympus was sliding open flooding the cavern with unfiltered light the linear accelerator roared an arc of lightning ran bottom to top the crater began to close louis turned back to the display looking over tunesmiths shoulder he watched fusion light flare from offscreen and dwindle to a bright point whatever tunesmith had launched was already too far to see tunesmith had joined the fringe war a protector could not be expected to do nothing even if the alternative was to bring war down on their heads louis scowled bram the protector had been crazy even if supremely intelligent louis must eventually decide ifnbsp tunesmith was crazy too and what to do about it meanwhile this latest maneuver should keep the protector busy now how much freedom had louis been allotted louis said hindmosts voice show me the locations of all stepping disks the hindmosts voice popped up three hundred and sixty degrees of map room the ringworld surrounded louis a ring six hundred million miles around and a million miles wide banded in blue for day and black for night and broad fuzzy edges for dusk and dawn winking orange cursor lights were displayed across its face some were shaped like arrowheads this pattern had changed greatly since louis had last seen it how many ninetyfive stepping disks are now in use two failed three were dropped into deep space and probes launched through them the fleets shot them down ten are held in reserve the hindmost had stocked stepping disks aboard hot needle of inquiry but not a hundred and ten is the hindmost building more stepping disks with his help tunesmith has built a steppingdisk factory work proceeds slowly the blinking orange lights that marked stepping disks were thick along the near side of the ringworld the great ocean arc the far side looked sparse two blinking orange arrowheads had nearly reached the edge of the other ocean others were moving in that direction the other ocean was a diamond shape sprawling across most of the width of the ringworld one hundred eighty degrees around from the great ocean two such masses of water must counterbalance each other the hindmosts crew had not explored the other ocean high time louis thought most of the stepping disks were clustered around the great ocean and of those most were in a tight cluster that must be the map of mars louis pointed at one offshore from mars what is that that is hot needle of inquiry s lander teela the protector had blasted the lander during their last duel its functional the steppingdisk link is functional what about the lander life support is marginal drive systems and weaponry have failed can some of these service stacks be locked out of the system that has been done lines spread across the map to link the blinking lights some had crossedcircle verboten marks on them closed the maze was complicated and louis didnt try to understand it my master has override codes the voice said may i have those no number these steppingdisk sites for me then print out a map as the ringworld was vast the scale was extreme his naked eye would never get any detail out of it when the map extruded he folded it and stuffed it in a pocket anyway he broke for lunch and came back he set two service stacks moving and changed a number of links the hindmosts voice printed another map with his changes added he pocketed that too better keep both now with luck hed have avenues of travel unknown to tunesmith or it might be wasted effort the hindmost when he woke could change it all back in a moment the voice refused to make weapons of course the kitchen in needle s crew quarters hadnt done that either tunesmith was still at the end of a boom still tracking whatever hed launched where are the rest of us louis asked the voice who do you seek acolyte i do not have that name the kzin we shared this ship with chmeees child i list that le as bloodcurdling howl louis had to pry his fingers loose from a table edge rename him acolyte please the map was back and a blinking point next to fistofgod a hundred thousand miles portandantispin from fistofgod four times the circumference of the earth and twice that far to spinward of the map of mars the hugeness of the ringworld had to be learned over and over the voice said here we set acolyte with a service stack thirtyone days ago he has since moved by eleven hundred miles the point jumped minutely tunesmith has altered the setting for the stepping disk it sends to an observation point on the map of earth home to acolytes father has he used it no where are the city builders do you mean the librarians kawaresksenjajok and fortaralisplyar and three children were returned to their origin good hed meant to do that himself to the library in the floating city i note your approval who else shall i track who else had been his companions two protectors bram the vampire protector was dead tunesmith was still busy it seemed in the meteor defense room the protectors telescope screen was following a receding point the vehicle hed launched earlier its drive was off flared brilliantly and blinked off again that was a warship reaction motors were still needed for war modern thrusters couldnt switch on and off as fast louis asked have you kept track of valavirgillin the map jumped here near the floating city and a local center of machine people culture good and she was well away from vampires they had not met in twelve years why did you track her hindmosts voice orders carefully who do you take orders from from you and tunesmith and a blast of orchestral chaos piercingly sweet louis recognized the hindmosts true name but all such may be countermanded by the hindmosts name again is tunesmith restricted from any interesting levels of this ship not currently the hindmost was still in wrappedaroundhimself catatonia how long since hes eaten louis asked two local days he wakes to eat wake him up how shall i wake him without trauma i saw him in a dance once turn that on prepare food for him
