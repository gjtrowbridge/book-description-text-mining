 chapter 1 lee orlando florida january 28 2006 there is a ride at disney world called the tower of terror and on the weekend of january 28 2006 my four children even the twin five yearolds begged me to go on that ride over and over again housed in a recreated aging hollywood hotel the ride begins where you climb into a creaky elevator that snakes its way through the creepy premises an electrical storm kicks up and right on cue something goes wrong with the power the elevator in the eerie hotel suddenly drops the descent is so rapid so sudden that it almost sucks your diaphragm up into your throat and right before the drop there is a moment where you are literally suspended in air too stunned to scream it feels as if speed motion light and time literally freeze we must have taken that ride a half dozen times and then the feeling returned the following morning as i rolled over in my kingsized hotel bed the day before the kids and i had been to the animal kingdom in disney world we8217d marveled at the african safari ride ridden rapids in asia and gotten soaked as we howled our way down the manmade white water after an early dinner we8217d rented a pedal bike with another family and laughed until we cried as we raced other bikers around the lake while fireworks from epcot exploded overhead tucking four kids into bed that night i silently congratulated myself on a good weekend i8217d come to disney to shoot a pilot tv show for family fun we8217d spent two days on set and then the rest of the time had been the kids8217 reward combing the parks for disney character autographs for the twins and thrillseeking rides for the older two we8217d planned to fly back home on sunday and get ready for school toting around four children by myself was not new that weekend my husband bob woodruff the newly anointed coanchor of abc8217s world news tonight was thousands of miles away in iraq we spoke to him briefly that day in between the safari and the rapids ride he and his crew had had a tiring day covering the palestinian elections before flying on to baghdad in advance of president bush8217s state of the union address the plan was to bolster abc8217s iraq coverage at an important moment in the war the pace was blistering common to any foreign correspondent who must keep moving and file stories from faraway places in time zones eight to twelve hours ahead of our own bob and his crew were operating on an aggressive schedule with only a few hours8217 sleep each night as usual the itinerary was punishing get in get the stories about the iraqi military anchor from baghdad during bush8217s address do some pieces for good morning america and on the way back try to finalize an interview with the king of jordan in amman the jordanian capital our conversations with him from disney world had been short and tough the cell service in iraq was spotty and the time difference was frustrating we had one conversation midday saturday as he and his crew were going to bed in a military compound somewhere in baghdad he exhaustedly mumbled something about getting muchneeded sleep the next day exactly what he said didn8217t register with me at the time my daughter cathryn was determined to buy a puka shell necklace with my shoulder cradling the cell phone i negotiated some cash from my wallet while keeping an eye on the twins who were dangerously close to a fence in front of a bamboo grove later bob would swear that he told me has was going to embed with the military for some exercises while i would swear he said only that his team was going to relax for the day at the end of our conversation i passed the cell phone around so the kids could say hi this was common practice in our house8212good nights kisses homework help all via satellite when your father covers news around the world the phone becomes a primary communication tool for better or worse 8220do you feel safe there8221 i asked absentmindedly collecting the change from cathryn 8220are you okay8221 it was a stupid rhetorical question made more absurd by the fact that we were currently standing in disney world 8220the happiest place on earth8221 while he was somewhere in the most violent place on the planet 8220i do we8217re surrounded by the military it8217s fine8221 he reassured me he and his cameraman doug vogt couldn8217t know that the elevator was about to drop in the ochercolored sands on a godforsaken highway outside baghdad they were about to enter their own tower of terror that night i called the front desk to request a 7 am wakeup call with the bigger kids sleeping next to the twins perhaps i could slip downstairs the next morning and take a quick swim in the pool before breakfast even though it was january in florida the water was invigorating and it would be a great way to start our last day in orlando in a few days bob would be home and we8217d be a family again his new appointment as coanchor had set a grueling pace for the past month even the weekends his days had been crammed with photo shoots press conferences and ad campaigns the new program with bob and elizabeth vargas was committed to go to the story to have one anchor on the road and one in the studio as often as possible bob relished the challenge it was a new era at abc news there was an excitement at the broadcast that was a welcome tonic after the months of sorrow following peter jennings8217s illness and then death from lung cancer bob and elizabeth would give the news department something to rally around after feeling like a ship without its beloved captain 8220just get through january8221 i had told bob as he left for the middle east on that fateful trip it had become a kind of mantra for us after the announcement as he shot out of the gate as a newly minted coanchor 8220i really don8217t want to leave you guys8221 he said as he leaned into the door frame of my home office rolling suitcase in hand he looked exhausted distracted and not eager to get back on a plane to return to iraq for the sixth or seventh time in three years the town car was already idling in the driveway 8220just get through january8221 i repeated 8220and life will take on a more normal pattern we8217ll have weekends again and we can be a family8221 he reeled off everything he8217d packed hoping i8217d figure out what he might have missed this was familiar territory this nonchalant leaving it should have had more weight but to give it any more importance would have jinxed it in my mind pakistan afghanistan iraq the gaza strip give him a kiss as always treat it like a normal morning and he will come home safe and sound i had a work deadline that day and the sooner i got him on the road the faster i could finish my task frankly i didn8217t think a lot about bob over the disney weekend either the days had been full and the kids eager to pack in as much as possible bob drew sustenance from being on the road the stories the energy the adrenaline rejuvenated him he loved being a journalist and that meant leaving us for stretches of time we may not have always liked it but we had made peace with it as a family periods of being intensely together were interlaced with periods of being apart as i rolled over and turned off the bedside light that saturday night in disney world i thought we would all rise to this new challenge of bob8217s career as well 8220coanchor8221 it was good and bad good because he had reached the pinnacle of his profession a plum job in television news a successor to one of broadcast journalism8217s icons bad because we would see him even less our definition of family time would need some revising the sunday morning phone call pierced the quiet and i jolted awake to a bedspread of floral and chintz in a totally unfamiliar room it took me a second to register where i was ah right i thought disney world the wakeup call i rolled over and picked up the receiver 8220thank you8221 i said and lazily began to set it back on the cradle i had decided to lie there for a few more minutes before i snuck out the door 8220lee8221 a faint voice came from the receiver now almost back in place geesh i thought personalized wakeup calls how very disney i brought the phone back to my ear to thank the man 8220lee it8217s david westin8221 the voice said he had my immediate attention my brain fired signals to my body as i bolted up on the pillows the president of abc news does not make social calls to employees8217 wives at 7 am on a sunday morning even a coanchor8217s wife i licked my lips and swallowed my mouth was dry 8220we8217ve been trying to reach you8221 he said in a slow measured voice he stopped for a beat as if to gauge how he would say his next line 8220bob has been wounded in iraq8221 i sat straight up trying to process the information i was hearing every synapse in my brain was firing 8220wounded8221 i said to david westin as calmly as i could 8220what do you mean wounded8221 8220he was on an embed outside of baghdad riding with the iraqi army we don8217t have a lot of information right now lee but we are getting it as fast as we can we are getting him the best care possible8221 8220david8221 i interrupted him 8220is my husband alive8221 8220yes lee bob is alive but we believe he may have taken shrapnel to the brain8221 i tried to digest what that meant and couldn8217t comprehend it he was alive i8217d start with that the rest was gravy 8220what was an anchor doing on a military exercise8221 i asked voice rising 8220the last thing i knew he was doing a story about an ice cream shop in baghdad i thought they were sleeping8221 my mind grasped for facts searching for what i knew or thought i knew i was back in the tower of terror you can8217t know how you would behave in a crisis until it drops out of the sky and knocks you down like a bandit stealing your future robbing you of your dreams and mocking anything that resembles certainty sudden tragic events and even slowburning disasters teach us more about ourselves than most of us care to know i felt the panic in my voice as i spoke to david westin and slow tears streamed down my face at the same time i began to feel a cool steely calm seep into my brain it slowly formed a cocoon in which i could think and react rationally disembodied from my emotions in the months to come this cocoon would allow me to handle the very public nature of this crisis synthesize information deal with teams of doctors communicate with family and take care of the business at hand without collapsing into a mass of spineless marrow for now that steely calm began to morph into the part of me that became 8220the general8221 the general would make important decisions hold things together for the troops lead the charge and8212most important for our team8212ensure we didn8217t lose a single man on the battlefield the general was beginning to take over 8220lee we have a plane waiting to take you and the kids home to westchester8221 david said 8220you just have to tell us what time it8217s fueled up and ready to go8221 i felt i needed to keep him on the line for some reason i wasn8217t ready to start making decisions i didn8217t want to take my first step into this new world i wanted to relish my old life for just a minute more all four of my children were blissfully sound asleep beyond my door inside my room their secure little lives were being hacked apart while they dreamed oblivious to the chaos 8220okay8221 i said in a small voice 8220tell me what you know please tell me what happened8221 8220bob and the crew were traveling on a road in taji on a routine ride8221 david said 8220bob was in an iraqi armored vehicle we believe he was doing a standup at the time and they were hit by an ied improvised explosive device in an orchestrated attack on the convoy there was gunfire after that but neither man was hit bob and the cameraman doug vogt have been taken by helicopter to baghdad and are going into surgery 8220apparently he asked vinnie his producer if he was alive he did come to8221 david spoke coolly and rationally but he was clearly rattled so he spoke i thought he spoke this is going to be okay the general in my brain dictated that nothing less than recovery would be acceptable there were no other options bob would be okay he was always okay he was lucky and bright and hardworking and a good man things like this didn8217t happen to good people i could feel hope in my heart on its simplest level as clear and bright as the streak of a shooting star hope is the most basic human emotion it was the hope that wives have had since the days of the caveman when they sent their mates out past the campfire to fight marauding tribes hope was good it was a brainstem reaction the general in my brain moved hope into the front lines preparing for the next maneuver 8220lee8221 david gently reminded me 8220there are security people on the ground to escort you out of there the plane is standing by you just need to tell us what you want to do let us know what time you want to go when you get home we are working on getting you to germany where bob will be transported8221 for one moment the silliest thought flashed through my mind i thought about how much my kids had wanted to ride the soarin8217 attraction and see the rest of epcot the part of my brain that was still in shock weighed the option of not ruining their perfectly planned morning for about a tenth of a second before i clicked into action 8220david let me process this8221 i said 8220i have to call bob8217s folks and my family and then i have to wake up the kids and pack and i need to think let me just get outside of this hotel room so i can talk and then i8217ll call you back as soon as possible8221
