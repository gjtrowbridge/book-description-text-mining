 on the morning of september 11 2001 the greatest wouldbe mass murderer since adolf hitler was locked down in solitary confinement in a colorado prison in a sevenbytwelvefoot cell at the supermax the most secure of all federal jails ramzi yousef sat waiting like a bird of prey small gaunt and reed thin with closecropped hair and two milkygray eyes he looked across his cell at the stainlesssteel toilet and sink below a shelf supporting a thirteeninch tv it was yousefs only link to the outside world as cnn played silently in the background his eyes darted across the dogeared pages of his koran yousef may not have known the precise moment of the attacks but he was sure they would come after all hed set them in motion seven years before in manila the idea of hijacking jetliners laden with fuel and using them as missiles to take down great buildings had come to the bomb maker after hed tried to kill a quarter of a million people with his first twin towers device in 1993 hed gone on to plot the deaths of president clinton pope john paul ii and the prime minister of pakistan while hatching a fiendish plan to destroy up to a dozen jumbo jets as they flew over american cities but his most audacious plot involved a return to new york to finish the job hed started in the fall of 1992 in one horrific morning suicide bombers trained as pilots would take the cockpits aboard a series of commercial airliners and drive them into the trade center towers the pentagon and a series of other us buildings now just before 645 am mountain time as ramzi yousef sat in the supermax reading the koran he heard muffled noises on the cell block inmates shouting one of the prisoners down the corridor had been watching cnn and now he was screaming a guard rushed to his cell went inside and saw the devastation he yelled some plane just hit the trade center yousef quickly looked up at the blackandwhite tv above his head eyes wide at the site of the north tower burning he turned up the sound and heard the voice of an eyewitness i just saw the entire top part of the world trade center explode yousef rocked back amazed himself at the execution of his plan he stared at the news footage of racing fdny engines terrified evacuees and bodies dropping from the towers then from the battery a camera captured united airlines flight 175 slamming into the south tower another onlooker described it as a sickening sight but yousef the master terrorist saw it as the culmination of a dream and the end to some unfinished business he dropped to the floor bent over and gave thanks praise allah the merciful and the just the lord of the worlds we thank you for delivering this message to the apostates later that morning yousefs cell door swung open and a pair of fbi agents from the colorado springs office came in they stood in the threefootwide anteroom between the solid steel cell door and the bars to the cell the convicted terrorist got up from his bed and approached the bars as the two agents presented bureau ids and identified themselves why do you come here he demanded one of the agents nodded to the tv behind yousef still tuned to cnn did you have anything to do with that yousef shot back how would i possibly know what was going on from in here besides i am represented by counsel you have no right to question me without my attorney present the two agents eyed each other now they were facing yousef the lawyer the man who had represented himself throughout the entire three months of the manila airline bombing trial i have nothing else to say to you snapped yousef he turned up the sound on the tv and sat back down on his bed the agents withdrew but within minutes the steel door swung back open and two bureau of prisons guards stormed in as one began to unlock yousefs cell bars the other one shouted get up and face the wall yousef stared at him defiantly for a moment but then the guard slammed a black box and a belly belt chain against the bars so yousef got up now as he faced the wall one guard came in and quickly put the belt around his waist the other one bent down and snapped on ankle irons and a chain what is this shouted yousef what are you doing changing cells said one of the guards he turned off the tv hands clasped in front of you yousef ground his teeth but complied as the guard snapped the black box onto his wrist a sixinchlong solid restraint that rendered the prisoners hands completely immobile the guard locked the box onto the belly belt making it impossible now for yousef to strike out with his arms or fists the guards turned him around and shuffled him out of the cell moving him down the corridor of d wing past the cell of the infamous unabomber ted kaczynski for a time this socalled bombers row had also housed convicted oklahoma city bombers timothy mcveigh and terry nichols one of the guards unlocked the door to an empty cell and moved yousef inside as he continued to rant why are you moving me my papers you have to let me take my koran but when the guards had him locked behind the cell bars they slammed closed the steel door and went back to yousefs cell there they began to toss it searching around the mattress and on the shelf beside the bed throwing yousefs letters papers and drawings into a plastic garbage bag the units on the maximumsecurity d wing are supposed to be soundproof but as the guards worked to clean out yousefs cell they could still hear him screaming down the corridor
