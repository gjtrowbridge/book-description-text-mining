 chapter one the mysterious stranger filled evangeline with both excitement and a nameless dread he bowed then kissed her hand permit me to introduce myself he said i am the count korlovsky from the first draft of the castle of count korlovsky the westover papers bath england 1817 her plan was all very well in theory lady diana westover decided as she marched toward the pump room alongside her aunts unfortunately the execution was going to be rather more difficult than she had assumed her hands were definitely clammy in her gloves and her heart beat with a wild rhythm she hadnt experienced since her horse had bolted on her when she was ten years old to be sure bath was no longer the epicenter of fashionable life it had once been but that didnt lessen dianas uncomfortable sensation that she was too countrified and woefully unprepared maybe she should claim a headache and return to her aunts townhouse or all the way back to lincolnshire except that she had a plan that she couldnt abandon now and that meant being around fashionable people well men she needed to meet men and to do that she needed her aunts who lived in bath a spa town famous for the hot spring that had been used since roman times aunt calliope and aunt euphenia were only too delighted to take her under their wing as diana knew they would be indeed theyd been anxious to do that for years so now here she was on this fine day in may trooping toward the large building where the supposedly restorative spring water was dispensed dressed in a lilac pelisse a bonnet she thought had been overly decorated with a riot of flowers thin kid gloves and carrying a reticule that contained smelling salts and little else aunt calliope had insisted that no proper young lady left the house without smelling salts even though diana had assured her that she had never needed them before even when her horse had bolted that had been shocking enough for aunt calliope but the poor woman had had to lie down when diana also admitted she often walked for miles in the country and without a chaperon as they neared the pump room diana again glanced surreptitiously at her aunts one on either side of her like a guard of honor lady calliope fitzburton was dressed very stylishly although her bonnet adorned with false fruit and ribbons looked more suited to a buffet table than a middleaged womans head she was however as sharp and brighteyed as a woman half her age which could be something of a problem when one was trying to keep a secret lady euphenia harbage older wiser and calmer was dressed in a more muted fashion she had much less money to spend on her clothes thanks to a spendthrift gambling husband now mercifully deceased like diana she was a guest in her widowed sisters home albeit a permanent one aunt euphenia patted dianas arm gently since this is all very new for you we wont stay long in the pump room she assured her well see if any acquaintances are there make a few engagements if we can and then we shall leave diana relaxed a bit but really what was she so worried about it wasnt as if she had only this one chance to find what she sought or that these fashionable sophisticated people held any power over her she would just imagine that she was going into battle like hector at troy achilles the spartans at thermopolae well not the spartans they had all died we must spend some time in the pump room aunt calliope exclaimed the force of her remark causing her bonnet to tilt dangerously dear diana must be noticed i dont want to make a sensation diana said meaning it she was there to observe not participate or at least no more than necessary to gain some acquaintance of men who had not spent most of their lives in lincolnshire of course not that wouldnt be modest or proper and you are a very modest and proper young lady aunt euphenia replied you do look lovely though my dear and i daresay some of the young men will think so too diana refrained from pointing out to her kindhearted aunt that while she looked as pleasing to the male eye as it was possible for her to be her appearance was hardly likely to elicit rapturous approval from the young men of bath has madame rotellini not outdone herself with that bonnet aunt calliope asked addressing aunt euphenia i absolutely agree and you were right about that color for dianas ensemble lilac suits her perfectly and brings out the blue in her eyes mrs jenkins has fit the gown to perfection too im sure you wont be long in the marriage mart my dear aunt calliope said speaking to diana again although i wouldnt talk quite so much about books in fact i wouldnt talk very much at all let the young men do that yes aunt diana obediently replied but with a gleam of mischief in her eyes ill be on my very best behavior because who knows perhaps if i am lucky and the ancient roman gods of aqua sulis are with me i may even meet my future husband this very day naturally i wouldnt want him to think i talk too much aunt calliope came to a dead halt for heavens sake diana dont talk about ancient gods being with you when we are in the pump room people will think youre a heathen diana nodded solemnly although if her aunt had been a little more perceptive she would have noted the gleam in her nieces bright blue eyes
