 chapter excerpt chapter one my grandfather was an unpleasant old man after he died i frequently heard my grandmother say she missed him like a wooden leg though shed grown used to his bark over the years she didnt miss a single splinter and limped along just fine without him mrs welterby to the countess of firth while waiting for the prince to make an appearance in the drawing room of carlton house devon st john paced before the fireplace his hands clasped behind his back his brow furrowed his abrupt footfalls silenced by the thick rug that stretched the length of the huge chamber were overshadowed by the crackle of burning logs suddenly he halted before a large wingback chair turned toward the warming flames i know you can tell him me his brother brandon shook his head the firelight casting blue shadows through his black hair the last time i delivered bad news to marcus he sent me to oversee the holdings in northern scotland for a month i nearly froze to death chase glanced up from where he slouched on the settee opposite i was once sent to the wilds of yorkshire in the middle of the season for an equally inane reason and that was back during the time when our brother was tolerable which has not been of late brandon said chase nodded morosely lately he has been nothing but a seething mass of ill temper god knows where hed order us now if he had a true reason to be upset devon sighed heavily i must apologize to all of you this is my fault the last and quietest member of the gathering finally stirred to life devons half brother anthony elliot the earl of greyley stretched his legs toward the fire from the depths of a huge red velvet chair he surveyed devon with a sleepy air nonsense the ring was lost by accident and nothing more i should have made more of an effort to find it but somehow i thought it would be humorous to send marcus chasing about for the blasted thing it was amusing brandon said until marcus could not find it you sent marcus the guest list for the ball where the ring disappeared and we were all certain that ring would be in the hands of one of those guests chase nodded indeed had the guests not brought guests of their own that is where we caught cold and now marcuss humor wears more thin as the days pass and the ring is not found hes like a great bear denied his food anthony shrugged so let him growl he is but a man you know what marcus is devon said our brother is a gale wind in a world of gentle breezes brandon sighed and slouched back in his chair he defi nitely has some very odd notions about marriage im in poor case with him this very moment because verenas father got into some trouble with the italian authorities and i had to pay the scoundrels way out of it marcus disapproved mightily chases brows lowered what else could you do its verenas father marcus does not seem to understand that when you marry a woman to some extent you also marry her family theres a lot about marriage marcus doesnt understand anthony murmured reclaiming his glass of port and taking another sip he seems to understand the concept of having a mistress far better that he does but a wife is a different matter altogether chase rose from the settee and stretched his arms over his head before crossing to the desk to pour himself a drink from a crystal decanter lately hes been snappish in fact harriet wanted to invite him to our new house for the holidays excellent brandon said brightening immediately bloody excellent everyone looked his way oh uhm sorry brandon smiled uneasily verena had the same idea though i had no wish to have marcus growling his way through our holidays she and i finally agreed that we would invite him only if none of you did but since chase and harriet are going to invite him you didnt give me time to finish my sentence chase said harriet wanted to invite him but then reconsidered theres precious little to entertain marcus out in the country and since harriets not feeling well chase grinned a little as he lifted his glass in a seeming toast yet another reason im glad my lovely wife is increasing brandon grimaced i wish verena was increasing as well especially if it would keep marcus away from us during the holidays hes become a grump only yesterday he said that christmas was a waste of time and energy and he hated all the fuss devon sighed hes impossible he hasnt spoken a civil word to me since i lost the ring and that was months ago i must admit i thought the blasted thing would be easier to recover than this he rubbed his chin a frown in his blue eyes its almost as if the ring doesnt wish to be found silence met this finally chase cleared his throat we have never really talked about it but are we all agreed about the ring he eyed his brothers carefully the legend is true anthony noted that his other brothers appeared uneasy with that bold question the silence grew thick and then thicker he supposed he couldnt fault them after all the ring had contributed in some way to each of their marriages i dont know about anyone else but i believe it
