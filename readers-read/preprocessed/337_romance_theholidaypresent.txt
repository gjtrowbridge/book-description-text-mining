 chapter one england 1825 the malory clan always spent the christmas holidays at haverston the ancestral estate in the country where the oldest among them had been born and raised jason malory third marquis of haverston and the oldest of four brothers was the only family member who was still a permanent resident the head of the family since he was only sixteen jason had raised his brothers two of whom had been utterly scandalous in their pursuits and a young sister at present the various malorys and offspring were quite numerous and difficult to place sometimes even for jason himself so it was a very large brood that gathered at haverston these days for the christmas season jasons only son and heir derek was the first to arrive more than a week before christmas with him came his wife kelsey and jasons first two blond and greeneyed grandchildren anthony his youngest brother was the next to arrive only a few days after derek tony as most of the family called him admitted to jason that hed deserted london early after hearing that their brother james had a bone to pick with him annoying james was one thing and something anthony often strived to do but when james was out for blood well tony considered that a different matter entirely anthony and james were his youngest brothers yet only a year apart in age themselves they were both skilled pugilists and anthony could hold his own with the best of them yet james was heftier and his fists were frequently likened to solid bricks with anthony came his wife roslynn and their two daughters judith the oldest at six had taken after both her parents having her mothers glorious redgold hair and her fathers cobalt blue eyes a seriously striking combination that anthony feared was going to make her the reigning beauty of her day which as her father and a reformed rake he was not looking forward to but his younger daughter jaime was going to break some hearts as well but even with all his guests jason was the first one to notice the present that had appeared in the parlor while the family was breakfasting it was hard to miss actually placed prominently up on a pedestal table next to the fireplace wrapped in gold cloth banded with a red velvet ribbon and bow it was oddly shaped nearly like the size of a thick book yet a round protrusion on top suggested it was nothing that simple poking a finger at it showed that the protrusion could move yet not very much as he found out when he tilted the present sideways and it didnt change position strange yet stranger still was that there was no indication of whom the present was from nor whom it was for a bit early to be passing out christmas gifts aint it anthony remarked as he sauntered into the room to find jason holding the present the christmas tree aint even been brought in yet that was my thought as well since i didnt put it here jason replied no then who ive no idea jason admitted whos it for then anthony asked id like to know that myself anthony raised a brow at that point no card jason shook his head none i just found it here on this pedestal myself he said and put it back anthony picked up the present as well to poke at it a bit hmmm someone sure dressed it up fancy ill wager it will fascinate the children at least until we find out what it is as it happened it fascinated the adults as well in the following days since none of the family owned up to having put it there the present created a sensation just about all of the adults poked shook or otherwise examined it yet no one could figure out what it might be or whom it was for those having arrived so far were gathered in the parlor the night when amy walked in holding one of her twins dont ask why were late you wouldnt believe it she said then in the next breath first the wheel on the coach fell off then not a mile down the road one of the horses lost not one but two of his shoes after we finally get that all taken care of and were almost here the bloody axle broke i thought surely warren was going to kill that poor coach by then he certainly kicked it enough if i didnt think to wager with him that we would arrive here today i really dont think we would have but you know i never lose a wager so by the by uncle jason whats an unmarked grave doing in that lovely clearing east of here the one close to the road that runs through your property we ended up walking through it to get here since it was the shorter route by that point to just head across that clearing no one said a word at first still in bemusement after that long dissertation but then derek said remember that grave mself now that you mention it cousin reggie and i came across it when we were younguns gadding about the estate always meant to ask you about it father just never got around to it then forgot about it they were all looking toward jason by then but he merely shrugged his broad shoulders devil if i know who was laid to rest there that grave has been there since before i was born asked my father about it once as i recall but he put off answering hemmed and hawed so much actually that i figured he just didnt know so i didnt ask again
