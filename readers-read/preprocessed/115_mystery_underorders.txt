 ldquosadly death at the races is not uncommon however three in a single afternoon was sufficiently unusual to raise more than one eyebrowrdquo itrsquos the third death on cheltenham gold cup day that really troubles supersleuth sid halley last seen in 1995rsquos come to grief former champion jockey halley knows all too well the perils of racingmdashbut in his day jockeys didnrsquot usually reach the finishing line with three 38 rounds in the chest yet this is precisely how he finds jockey huw walkermdashwho only a few hours earlier won the coveted triumph hurdle just moments before the gruesome discovery halley had been called upon by lord enstone to make discreet inquiries into why his horses appeared to be on a permanent losing streak are races being fixed are bookies taking a cut and if so are trainers and jockeys playing a dangerous game with stakes far higher than they realize halleyrsquos quest for answers draws him even deeper into the darker side of the racing game in a lifeordeath power play that will push him to his very limitsmdashboth professionally and personally sadly death at the races is not uncommon however three in a single afternoon was sufficiently unusual to raise more than an eyebrow that only one of the deaths was of a horse was more than enough to bring the local constabulary hotfoot to the track cheltenham gold cup day had dawned bright and sunny with a fine dusting of march frost showing white between the grass the forecast for the day was dreadful with heavy rain due to drive in from the west but as i stood in my exfatherinlawrsquos kitchen looking through the window at the westerly sky there was no sign yet of the warm front that was promised ldquothere you are sidrdquo said charles coming into the kitchen in his dressing gown over striped pajamas with soft blue velvet slippers on his feet rear admiral charles rowland royal navy retired my onetime fatherinlaw my confidant my mentor and without doubt my best friend i still introduced him to strangers as my fatherinlaw although it was now some ten years since his daughter jenny my wife had seen the need to give me an ultimatum give up my job or she would give me up like any man at the top of his profession i had assumed she didnrsquot really mean it and continued to work day in and day out and so jenny left with acrimony and spite the fact that a crippling injury put a stop to my chosen profession just a few months later was one of those little ironies from which there is no escape our marriage had been irreparably damaged and there was no going back indeed by then neither of us had wanted to go back but it still took many years and many hurtful exchanges before we were both able to move on in time jenny and i had divorced and she had remarried to a title and some serious wealth nowadays we are civil to each other and i have a real hope that an armrsquoslength affection may be the endgame of our tempestuous relationship ldquomorning charlesrdquo i said ldquoitrsquos a good one toordquo ldquobloody forecastersrdquo he replied ldquonever have the slightest ideardquo he leaned towards the window to get a better view of the weather vane on the garage roofldquosouthwesterlyrdquo he remarked ldquothat front has still to arrive better take an umbrella with usrdquo i didnrsquot doubt that he was right a life at sea had given him the uncanny ability to predict the future simply by sticking a wet finger in the airhowever on this occasion i think it may have been more due to his listening to the radio in his bedroom his years afloat had also left him with a preference for allmale company there being no female personnel on ships in his day and a slow but determined approach to a problem as he had often told me it takes many miles to turn around an aircraft carrier and it is better to be sure in which direction you need to go before you start zigzagging all over the place and showing everyone what a blithering idiot you are we went to the races in his mercedes with raincoats and umbrellas stacked on the back seat as we drove west from his home in the oxfordshire village of aynsford across the cotswold hills towards cheltenham the sun began to hide behind high cirrus clouds it had disappeared altogether by the time we dropped down from cleeve hill to the racetrack and there were spots of rain on the windshield as we parked the racing festival at cheltenham is one of the worldrsquos great sporting occasions and a little rain couldnrsquot dampen our spirits i had ridden so often around this course that i felt i knew each blade of grass as an old friend in my dreams i still rode here surging down the hill towards the home straight kicking hard into the downhill fence when others would take a hold to steady themselves at this notorious obstacle here many a partnership would come crashing to the turf if not footperfect but winning was the important thing and while taking a hold might have been safer kicking your horse hard could gain you lengths over the fence lengths the opposition may not be able to regain up the hill to the finish line it had been a racing fall that had ended my riding career it should have been easy my young mount stumbling while landing over the second fence in a novice chase had failed to untangle his legs from underneath his neck and went down slowly to our right i could have almost stepped off but chose to move with the falling animal and roll away from his flailing hooves it was just unfortunate that a following horse having nowhere else to go had landed with all its weight on the outstretched palm of my left hand but it was more criminal than unfortunate that the horse had been wearing an old racing shoe sharpened by use into a jagged knifeedge which had sliced through muscle sinew bone and tendon leaving my hand useless and my life in ruins but i shouldnrsquot complain i had been champion jockey for four consecutive years having won more jump races than anyone else and would probably by now have had to retire anyway at thirtyeight i was well past the age at which even i thought it would be considered sensible to inflict the continuous battering on a human body ldquosidrdquo charles said snapping me back to realityldquoremember irsquom the guest of lord enstone today and he asked me whether yoursquod be coming up to his box for a drink laterrdquo ldquomayberdquo i said still half thinking about what might have been ldquohe seemed quite insistent that you shouldrdquo charles was pressing the point and i knew him well enough to know that this was his way of saying that it was important to him ldquoirsquoll be thererdquo if it were important to charles i would indeed be there i owed him a lot and paybacks such as this were cheap at least that is what i thought at the time we joined the throng pouring into the racetrack from the parking lots ldquohello mr halleyrdquo said the gateman ldquowhat do you fancy for the big racerdquo ldquohello tomrdquo i replied reading the name on his badge ldquooven cleaner must have a good chance especially if we get much more of this rain but donrsquot quote merdquo he waved me through with a laugh and without properly checking my badge exjockeys were a thorn for most tracks did they get free entry or not and for how long after theyrsquod retired did it depend on how good they had been why wouldnrsquot they go away and stop being an embarrassment always carrying on about how much better it had been when they were riding and that the jumps were getting too easy and hardly worthy of the name if tom had studied my badge more closely he would have seen that like me it was getting a bit old and worn i had simply not returned my metal jockeyrsquos badge when forced to retire and i had been using it ever since no one seemed to mind charles disappeared with a wave to make his way to the private luncheon boxes high in the grandstand while i walked unchallenged to the terrace in front of the weighing room next to the parade ring ldquosid halleyrdquo i turned with a smile ldquohowrsquos the sleuthing businessrdquo bill burton exjockey and now a midrank racehorse trainer whose waistline was getting bigger rather more quickly than his bank balance ldquofine billrdquowe shook hands warmlyldquokeeping me in mischiefrdquo ldquogood as long as you keep your nose out of my businessrdquo he said it with a smile that didnrsquot quite reach his eyes we had ridden against each other regularly over many seasons and both of us knew that he had never been totally averse to a little extra cash for ensuring that his horse didnrsquot get to the finish line first he would adamantly argue that he would only ldquostoprdquo those who had no chance anywaymdashwhat crime was there in that i could read in his face i thought that he had probably not changed his ways in moving from the saddle to the saddling box shame i thought bill was not a real villain but rumors were beginning to circulate that he was not fully honest eitheras always it was much easier to get such a reputation than to lose it bill couldnrsquot see that he was never going to be the leading trainer as he had hoped not because he didnrsquot have the ability but because he would not be sent the best horses by the most knowledgeable owners ldquodo you have any runners todayrdquo i asked ldquocandlestick in the first and leaded light in the fifth but i wouldnrsquot risk your shirt on either of themrdquo i wasnrsquot sure whether he was warning me that they might not be trying their best my doubts saddened me i liked bill a lotwe had been good friends and racing adversaries for many years he seemed to sense that i was looking deeper into his eyes than was prudent and briskly turned his head away ldquosorry sidrdquo he said in my ear as he pushed past into the weighing room ldquogot to go find my jockeyrdquo i watched him disappear through the door and then looked up in the paper who his jockey was huw walker one of the sportrsquos popular journeymen hersquod never yet made it to number one but had been consistently in the top ten over the past eight or nine years with numerous rides and plenty of winners son of a welsh farmer with it was said a fondness for fast women and fast cars in that order i hadnrsquot heard that he was ever suspected of ldquopullingrdquomdash horses that is in one of those strange almost supernatural moments i looked up to find huw walker coming towards me ldquohello huwrdquo i said ldquohi sid did you get my messagerdquo he looked far from his usual cheery self ldquonordquo i replied ldquowhere did you leave itrdquo ldquoon your answering machine last nightrdquo ldquowhich numberrdquo ldquoa london numberrdquo he was clearly anxious ldquosorry irsquom staying with my fatherinlaw for the festivalrdquo ldquoit doesnrsquot matter i canrsquot talk here irsquoll call you again laterrdquo ldquouse my cellrdquo i said and gave him the number he then rushed off disappearing into the weighing room
