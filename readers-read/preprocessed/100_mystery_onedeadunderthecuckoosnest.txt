 chapter excerpt chapter one this wont hurt i looked at my wellmeaning best friend and roommate miles scarpello and then snorted immediately after he spoke the foolish words my second best friend and roommate miless significant other goldie perlman joined in really suga it wont hurt blow he waved his hand in the air like a magic wand but only managed to snag his lovely ecru silk scarf with a long coralpainted nail goldie looked lovely in ecru matched his skin tone and made his goldenhaired wig look more real then again goldie looked beautiful in any color and always real my father added come on paczki i want a piece of cake everyone in the room leaned near as if a budding thirtyfiveyearold didnt have the wind to blow out thirtyfive stupid birthday candles i groaned at daddys pet name for me he had used the endearing polish term for a big fat round often prunefilled polish donut pronounced more like paunchki since my birth when i weighed in at a svelte ten pounds five ounces okay maybe svelte wasnt exactly the correct term but i remember seeing myself in the reflection of the metal bars of my bassinet and thinking i looked svelte and the nurse probably had her finger on the scale when she had weighed me my mother stella sokol blew out a breath and said really pauline sokol you are making a mountain out of a molehill turning thirtyfive is not the end of the world i looked out the window of my mothers house it wasnt hard to do from my seat since she pulled back the winter drapes to let the sun shine through the sheer white ones each spring season yep the world hadnt ended and was still out there in full force and i was officially thirtyfive years old and single and childless and in a profession i knew very little to nothing about but wouldnt trade for the world sure i had thirteen years experience as a registered nurse but being a slightly experienced medicalinsurancefraud investigator was just fine with me right now it was this stupid birthday thing that bugged me i looked around my parents house which by the way was straight out of a leave it to beaver television show with color added and thought some days i might go insane not that insanity ran in my family but then again there was that aunt back in pennsylvania who used to wear five dresses at once when she traveled to hope valley connecticut to come see us aunt flo had insisted her dresses wouldnt get wrinkled in her suitcase if she wore them all in the car once when shed had surgery on her knee she put three fitted sheets on her bed so that postop she could peel one off each week and she wouldnt have to do a lot of laundry i thought that was very clever i turned back to look at my family and wondered if aunt flo had been the only one with those genes daddy was already licking cake frosting off his finger before my mother even had a chance to pick up the knife he reached out again she swatted his hand away uncle walt my favorite uncle who had lived with us since i was born slept soundly in his seat at the diningroom table with telltale frosting on his lower lip too miles and goldie giggled like little kids while pouring each other champagne into the crystal goblets my mother had had since the fifties wasnt love grand the room was full of nieces nephews siblings and their spouses i tried not to look next to me at the table was nick caruso a fellow investigator okay i was stretching it nick was truly an investigator me i was still a newbie as my seamy boss fabio scarpello miless uncle since miles had been adopted into the scarpello family would call me but hey id finished two investigative cases and didnt get killed once as for nick he had become a bit more than a peer wed recently started dating dating a term id almost forgotten it hadnt taken me long to get back into the swing of it pretty much like riding a bicycle but and i have to be honest here nick didnt do it for me completely some might find him nicelooking dressed impeccably in camel hair suede or expensive linen anything but i never got detonation only a few shimmers nick was a doll though and treated me as such then still sitting across the table and at the invitation of my mother was jagger oops there went my heartbeat in a pitterpatter rhythm and i hadnt even looked at him that closely jaggerd worked on my two cases with me although to this day no one including moi knew who the hell he worked for fbi insurance company pi no one knew and jagger didnt share anything but he was darn driven our eyes locked make that his locked mine as usual and he gave a slight smile id never done very well with that body language stuff and trying to read jagger was like fingering braille not a clue for all i knew the smile couldve come from some thought hed just had and not one about me he looked toward the cake whose frosting was now nearly covered in wax for a second i thought about those wildfires that burn across millions of acres out west blow sherlock he said sherlock damn he used that pet name on me and each time my pretty damn high iq took a nosedive to zero and that blow part didnt exactly have me thinking birthday cake nick touched my arm go ahead pauline i yanked my eyes from jagger to smile at nick then i turned toward the cake and puffed out my cheeks eeeeeep eeeeeep
