 chapter one london 1806 the coach belonging to the duchess of magnus pulled up to the tall house on berkley square and an imposter stepped out the imposters long sturdy traveling cloak covered plain dark modest traveling clothes like the duchess she was tall and wellrounded and she spoke with the duchesss aristocratic accent also like the duchess she wore her black hair smoothed back from her face yet for the discerning eye the differences were obvious the imposter had a sweeter rounder face dominated by large blue eyes striking in their serenity her voice was husky warm rich her hands rested calmly at her waist and she moved with serene grace not at all with the brisk certainty of the duchess she was slow to smile slow to frown and never laughed with glorious freedom indeed she seemed to weigh each emotion before allowing it egress as if sometime in the past every drop of impulsiveness had been choked from her it wasnt that she was morose but she was observant composed and far too quiet yes a knowledgeable person would recognize the differences between the duchess and the imposter fortunately for miss eleanor madeline anne elizabeth de lacy no such person was in london at that moment with the exception of her groom her coachmen and footmen and they were all devoted to her cousin the real duchess and to eleanor the duchesss companion they would never betray eleanors mission they would never tell mr remington knight the truth eleanors heart sank as mr remington knights sternfaced butler made the announcement into the large echoing foyer her grace the duchess of magnus to hear herself presented in such a formal manner made her want to glance about for her cousin if only madeline were here if only she hadnt turned aside from this mission for a more important task if only eleanor hadnt agreed to impersonate her at the far end of the room a liveried footman bowed then disappeared into an open doorway he was gone only a moment then returned and inclined his head to the butler the butler turned to eleanor and intoned the master is busy but he will receive you soon in the meantime maam im bridgeport may i take your cloak and bonnet although noon had passed the mists outside subdued the sunlight into a wash of gray the light of the candles couldnt illuminate the dark corners of mr knights enormous entry an entry built to communicate in the surest way possible the owners wealth eleanors nostrils quivered with scorn bridgeport jumped a little as if anticipating her ripping at him as a substitute for his master of course mr knight would take this house he wanted everyone to know he was rolling in riches he was after all nothing more than an upstart american who dreamed of marrying a title yet the entry was decorated with velvet draperies of evergreen and gold and with a profusion of cut glass and beveled mirrors in marvelous good taste eleanor comforted herself with the thought that mr knight had bought it in this condition and was even now planning to gut it and install gilt in the chinese fashion a style fully as vulgar as eleanors mouth quirked with humor as vulgar as was adored by the prince of wales himself bridgeport relaxed and returned to his stolid demeanor he watched her much too closely because he thought she was the duchess or because his master had so instructed him she removed her bonnet stripped off her gloves placed them in the dark bonnet and handed them to the butler without a trace of outer trepidation after all what was the point of showing trepidation it would merely be another proof that although eleanor had traveled across wartorn europe as the duchesss companion she hadnt acquired the verve and confidence that characterized madelines every move this wasnt from lack of trials the two women had faced trials aplenty it was because eleanor sighed as she allowed the butler to take her cloak eleanor was born timid she never remembered a time when her fathers shouting hadnt paralyzed her with fright or when her stepmothers narroweyed glare hadnt had the power to turn her into a bowl of quivering blancmange which is why eleanor cultivated a serene facade she might be a coward but she saw no reason to announce the fact if you would follow me your grace to the large drawing room i will order refreshments bridgeport said you must be tired after your long journey not so long eleanor followed him through the tall door off to the left i stayed at the red robin inn last night and spent only four hours on the road this morning the butlers impassivity slipped and for a moment an expression of horror crossed his countenance your grace if i might make a suggestion when dealing with mr knight its best not to tell him that you failed to obey his instructions with all speed turning from her contemplation of the elegantly appointed room she raised her eyebrows in haughty imitation of her cousin and gazed at the butler in a frigid silence it must have worked for bridgeport bowed your pardon your grace ill send for tea thank you eleanor said with composure and more substantial refreshments also for she suspected mr knight intended to keep her waiting and it had been five hours since breakfast bridgeport left eleanor to scrutinize her grandiose prison tall windows let in the timid sunlight and the candles washed the walls with a pleasant golden glow books lined one wall reaching all the way to the twelvefoot ceiling
