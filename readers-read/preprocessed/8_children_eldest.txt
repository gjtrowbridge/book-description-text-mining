 the council of elders saphiras breathing quickened and she opened her eyes yawning expansively good morning little one is it he looked down and leaned on his hands compressing the mattress its terrible murtagh and ajihad why didnt sentries in the tunnels warn us of the urgals they shouldnt have been able to trail ajihads group without being noticed arya was right it doesnt make sense we may never know the truth said saphira gently she stood wings brushing the ceiling you need to eat then we must discover what the varden are planning we cant waste time a new leader could be chosen within hours eragon agreed thinking of how they had left everyone yesterday orik rushing off to give king hrothgar the tidings jrmundur taking ajihads body to a place where it would rest until the funeral and arya who stood alone and watched the goingson eragon rose and strapped on zarroc and his bow then bent and lifted snowfires saddle a line of pain sheared through his torso driving him to the floor where he writhed scrabbling at his back it felt like he was being sawed in half saphira growled as the ripping sensation reached her she tried to soothe him with her own mind but was unable to alleviate his suffering her tail instinctually lifted as if to fight it took minutes before the fit subsided and the last throb faded away leaving eragon gasping sweat drenched his face making his hair stick and his eyes sting he reached back and gingerly fingered the top of his scar it was hot and inflamed and sensitive to touch saphira lowered her nose and touched him on the arm oh little one it was worse this time he said staggering upright she let him lean against her as he wiped away the sweat with a rag then he tentatively stepped for the door are you strong enough to go we have to were obliged as dragon and rider to make a public choice regarding the next head of the varden and perhaps even influence the selection i wont ignore the strength of our position we now wield great authority written the varden at least the twins arent here to grab the position for themselves thats the only good in the situation very well but durza should suffer a thousand years of torture for what he did to you he grunted just stay close to me together they made their way through tronjheim toward the nearest kitchen in the corridors and hallways people stopped and bowed to them murmuring argetlam or shadeslayer even dwarves made the motions though not as often eragon was struck by the somber haunted expressions of the humans and the dark clothing they wore to display their sadness many women dressed entirely in black lace veils covering their faces in the kitchen eragon brought a stone platter of food to a low table saphira watched him carefully in case he should have another attack several people tried to approach him but she lifted a lip and growled sending them scurrying away eragon pretended to ignore the disturbances and picked at the food finally trying to divert his thoughts from murtagh he asked who do you think has the means to take control of the varden now that ajihad and the twins are gone she hesitated its possible you could if ajihads last words were interpreted as a blessing to secure the leadership almost no one would oppose you however that does not seem a wise path to take i see only trouble in that direction i agree besides arya wouldnt approve and she could be a dangerous enemy elves cant lie in the ancient language but they have no such inhibition in oursshe could deny that ajihad ever uttered those words if it served her purposes no i dont want the position what about jrmundur ajihad called him his righthand man unfortunately we know little about him or the vardens other leaders such a short time has passed since we came here we will have to make our judgment on our feelings and impressions without the benefit of history eragon pushed his fish around a lump of mashed tubers dont forget hrothgar and the dwarf clans they wont be quiet in this except for arya the elves have no say in the successiona decision will be made before word of this even reaches them but the dwarves cant bewont beignored hrothgar favors the varden but if enough clans oppose him he might be maneuvered into backing someone unsuited for the command and who might that be a person easily manipulated he closed his eyes and leaned back it could be anyone in farthen dr anyone at all
