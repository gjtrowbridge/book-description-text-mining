 chapter one culture talk or how not to talk about islam and politics this moment in history after the cold war is referred to as the era of globalization and is marked by the ascendancy and rapid politicizing of a single term culture during the cold war we discussed socioeconomic or political developments such as poverty and wealth democracy and dictatorship as mainly local events this new understanding of culture is less social than political tied less to the realities of particular countries than to global political events like the tearing down of the berlin wall or 911 unlike the culture studied by anthropologists8212facetoface intimate local and lived8212the talk of culture is highly politicized and comes in large geopackages culture talk assumes that every culture has a tangible essence that defines it and it then explains politics as a consequence of that essence culture talk after 911 for example qualified and explained the practice of 8220terrorism8221 as 8220islamic8221 8220islamic terrorism8221 is thus offered as both description and explanation of the events of 911 it is no longer the market capitalism nor the state democracy but culture modernity that is said to be the dividing line between those in favor of a peaceful civic existence and those inclined to terror it is said that our world is divided between those who are modern and those who are premodern the moderns make culture and are its masters the premoderns are said to be but conduits but if it is true that premodern culture is no more than a rudimentary twitch then surely premodern peoples may not be held responsible for their actions this point of view demands that they be restrained collectively if not individually8212if necessary held captive even unconditionally8212for the good of civilization in post8211911 america culture talk has come to focus on islam and muslims who made culture only at the beginning of creation as some extraordinary prophetic act after that it seems muslims just conformed to culture according to some our culture seems to have no history no politics and no debates so that all muslims are just plain bad according to others there is a history a politics even debates and there are good muslims and bad muslims in both versions history seems to have petrified into a lifeless custom of an antique people who inhabit antique lands or could it be that culture here stands for habit for some kind of instinctive activity with rules that are inscribed in early founding texts usually religious and mummified in early artifacts we need to distinguish between two contrasting narratives of culture talk one thinks of premodern peoples as those who are not yet modern who are either lagging behind or have yet to embark on the road to modernity the other depicts the premodern as also the antimodern whereas the former conception encourages relations based on philanthropy the latter notion is productive of fear and preemptive police or military action the difference is clear if we contrast earlier depictions of africans with contemporary talk about muslims during the cold war africans were stigmatized as the prime example of peoples not capable of modernity with the end of the cold war islam and the middle east have displaced africa as the hard premodern core in a rapidly globalizing world the difference in the contemporary perception of black africa and middle eastern islam is this whereas africa is seen as incapable of modernity hardcore islam is seen as not only incapable of but also resistant to modernity whereas africans are said to victimize themselves hardcore muslims are said to be prone to taking others along to the world beyond there is an interesting parallel between the pre8211911 debate on terrorism in africa and the post8211911 debate on global terrorism as in the current global debate african discussions too looked mainly or exclusively for internal explanations for the spread of terror in a rare but significant example that lumped african 8220tribalists8221 and muslim 8220fundamentalists8221 together as the enemy aryeh neier former president of human rights watch and now president of the george soros8211funded open society institute argued in an oped piece in the washington post that the problem is larger than islam it lies with tribalists and fundamentalists contemporary counterparts of nazis who have identified modernism as their enemy premodern peoples are said to have no creative ability and antimodern fundamentalists are said to have a profound ability to be destructive the destruction is taken as proof that they have no appreciation for human life including their own this is surely why culture talk has become the stuff of frontpage news stories culture is now said to be a matter of life and death this kind of thinking is deeply reminiscent of tracts from the history of modern colonization this history stigmatizes those shut out of modernity as antimodern because they resist being shut out it assumes that people8217s public behavior particularly their political behavior can be read from their habits and customs whether religious or traditional but could it be that a person who takes his or her religion literally is a potential terrorist and that someone who thinks of a religious text as metaphorical or figurative is better suited to civic life and the tolerance it calls for how one may ask does the literal reading of sacred texts translate into hijacking murder and terrorism two versions of culture talk contemporary culture talk dates from the end of the cold war and comes in two versions it claims to interpret politics from culture in the present and throughout history but neither version of culture talk is substantially the work of a historian if there is a founding father of contemporary culture talk it is bernard lewis the wellknown orientalist at princeton who has been an adviser to the us policy establishment the celebrated phrase of contemporary culture talk82128220a clash of civilizations82218212is taken from the title of the closing section of lewis8217s 1990 article 8220the roots of muslim rage8221 lewis8217s text provided the inspiration for a second and cruder version written by samuel huntington a political scientist at harvard whose involvement with the us policy establishment dates from the era of the vietnam war whereas lewis confined his thesis to historical relations between two civilizations he called 8220islamic8221 and 8220judeochristian8221 huntington8217s reach was far more ambitious he broadened lewis8217s thesis to cover the entire world 8220it is my hypothesis8221 huntington proclaimed in an article called 8220the clash of civilizations8221 1993 in foreign affairs that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic the great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural nationstates will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations the clash of civilizations will dominate global politics the fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future huntington8217s argument was built around two ideas that since the end of the cold war 8220the iron curtain of ideology8221 had been replaced by a 8220velvet curtain of culture8221 and that the velvet curtain had been drawn across 8220the bloody borders of islam8221 huntington cast islam in the role of an enemy civilization from this point of view muslims could be only bad huntington was not alone several others joined in translating his point of view into a vision broadly shared in hawkish circles of the policy and intellectual establishment the thrust of the new vision was that the ideological war we have come to know as the cold war was but a parochial curtainraiser for a truly global conflict for which 8220the west8221 will need to marshal the entire range of its cultural resources for william lind the cold war was the last in a series of 8220western civil wars8221 that started in seventeenthcentury europe with the end of the cold war he argued the lines of global conflict become cast in cultural terms r233gis debray himself an active participant in the ideological struggles of the cold war saw the new era as sharply defined by a 8220green peril82218212the color green presumably standing for islam8212far more dangerous than the red scares of yesteryears because it lacks rational selfrestraint 8220broadly speaking green has replaced red as the rising force the nuclear and rational north deters the nuclear and rational north not the conventional and mystical south8221 the idea of a clash of civilizations with civilizations marching through history like armed battalions8212with neither significant internal debates nor significant exchanges8212has been widely discredited edward w said the late palestinian literary scholar who was university professor at columbia forcefully argued for a more historical and less parochial reading of culture one informed by the idea that the clash is more inside civilizations than between them 8220to huntington what he calls 8216civilizational identity8217 is a stable and undisturbed thing like a room full of furniture in the back of your house8221 it is bernard lewis who has provided the more durable version of culture talk lewis both gestures toward history and acknowledges a clash within civilizations rather than claim an ahistorical global vision of a coming armageddon lewis thinks of history as the movement of large cultural blocs called civilizations but lewis writes of islamic civilization as if it were a veneer with its essence an unchanging doctrine in which muslims are said to take refuge in times of crisis 8220there is something in the religious culture of islam8221 lewis noted in 8220the roots of muslim rage8221 which inspired in even the humblest peasant or peddler a dignity and a courtesy toward others never exceeded and rarely equaled in other civilizations and yet in moments of upheaval and disruption when the deeper passions are stirred this dignity and courtesy toward others can give way to an explosive mixture of rage and hatred which impels even the government of an ancient and civi lized country8212even the spokesman of a great and ethical religion8212to espouse kidnapping and assassination and try to find in the life of their prophet approval and indeed precedent for such actions
