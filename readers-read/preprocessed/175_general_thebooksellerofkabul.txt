 the proposal when sultan khan thought the time had come to find himself a new wife no one wanted to help him first he approached his mother 8220you will have to make do with the one you have8221 she said then he went to his eldest sister 8220i8217m fond of your first wife8221 she said his other sisters replied in the same vein 8220it8217s shaming for sharifa8221 said his aunt sultan needed help a suitor cannot himself ask for a girl8217s hand it is an afghan custom that one of the women of the family convey the proposal and give the girl the onceover to assure herself that she is capable well brought up and suitable wife material but none of sultan8217s close female relations wanted to have anything to do with this offer of marriage sultan had picked out three young girls he thought might fit the bill they were all healthy and goodlooking and of his own tribe in sultan8217s family it was rare to marry outside the clan it was considered prudent and safe to marry relatives preferably cousins sultan8217s first candidate was sixteenyearold sonya her eyes were dark and almondshaped and her hair shining black she was shapely voluptuous and it was said of her that she was a good worker her family was poor and they were reasonably closely related her mother8217s grandmother and sultan8217s mother8217s grandmother were sisters while sultan ruminated over how to ask for the hand of the chosen one without the help of family women his first wife was blissfully ignorant that a mere chit of a girl born the same year she and sultan were married was sultan8217s constant preoccupation sharifa was getting old like sultan she was a few years over fifty she had borne him three sons and a daughter the time had come for a man of sultan8217s standing to find a new wife 8220do it yourself8221 his brother said finally after some thought sultan realized that this was his only solution and early one morning he made his way to the house of the sixteenyearold her parents greeted him with open arms sultan was considered a generous man and a visit from him was always welcome sonya8217s mother boiled water and made tea they reclined on flat cushions in the mud cottage and exchanged pleasantries until sultan thought the time had come to make his proposal 8220a friend of mine would like to marry sonya8221 he told the parents it was not the first time someone had asked for their daughter8217s hand she was beautiful and diligent but they thought she was still a bit young sonya8217s father was no longer able to work during a brawl a knife had severed some of the nerves in his back his beautiful daughter could be used as a bargaining chip in the marriage stakes and he and his wife were always expecting the next bid to be even higher 8220he is rich8221 said sultan 8220he8217s in the same business as i am he is well educated and has three sons but his wife is starting to grow old8221 8220what8217s the state of his teeth8221 the parents asked immediately alluding to the friend8217s age 8220about like mine8221 said sultan 8220you be the judge8221 old the parents thought but that was not necessarily a disadvantage the older the man the higher the price for their daughter a bride8217s price is calculated according to age beauty and skill and according to the status of the family when sultan khan had delivered his message the parents said as could be expected 8220she is too young8221 anything else would be to sell short to this rich unknown suitor whom sultan recommended so warmly it would not do to appear too eager but they knew sultan would return sonya was young and beautiful he returned the next day and repeated the proposal the same conversation the same answers but this time he got to meet sonya whom he had not seen since she was a young girl she kissed his hand in the custom of showing respect for an elder relative and he blessed the top of her head with a kiss sonya was aware of the charged atmosphere and flinched under uncle sultan8217s searching look 8220i have found you a rich man what do you think of that8221 he asked sonya looked down at the floor a young girl has no right to have an opinion about a suitor sultan returned the third day and this time he made known the suitor8217s proposition a ring a necklace earrings and bracelet all in red gold as many clothes as she wanted 600 pounds of rice 300 pounds of cooking oil a cow a few sheep and 15 million afghani approximately 500 sonya8217s father was more than satisfied with the price and asked to meet this mysterious man who was prepared to pay so much for his daughter according to sultan he even belonged to their tribe in spite of their not being able to place him or remember that they had ever met him 8220tomorrow8221 said sultan 8220i will show you a picture of him8221 the next day fortified by a sweetener sultan8217s aunt agreed to reveal to sonya8217s parents the identity of the suitor she took a photograph with her8212a picture of sultan khan himself8212and with it the uncompromising message that they had no more than an hour to make up their minds if the answer was yes he would be very grateful and if it was no there would be no bad blood between them what he wanted to avoid at all costs was everlasting bargaining about maybe maybe not the parents agreed within the hour they were keen on sultan khan his money and his position sonya sat in the attic and waited when the mystery surrounding the suitor had been solved and the parents had decided to accept her father8217s brother came up to the attic 8220uncle sultan is your wooer8221 he said 8220do you consent8221 not a sound escaped sonya8217s lips with tearful eyes and bowed head she hid behind her long shawl 8220your parents have accepted the suitor8221 her uncle said 8220now is your only chance to express an opinion8221 she was petrified paralyzed by fear she did not want the man but she knew she had to obey her parents as sultan8217s wife her standing in afghan society would go up considerably the bride money would solve many of her family8217s problems the money would help her parents buy good wives for their sons sonya held her tongue and with that her fate was sealed to say nothing means to give one8217s consent the agreement was drawn up the date fixed sultan went home to inform his family of the news his wife sharifa his mother and his sisters were seated around a dish of rice and spinach sharifa thought he was joking and laughed and cracked some jokes in return his mother too laughed at sultan8217s joke she could not believe that he had entered into a proposal of marriage without her blessing the sisters were dumbfounded no one believed him not until he showed them the kerchief and sweetmeats the parents of a bride give the suitor as proof of the engagement sharifa cried for twenty days 8220what have i done what a disgrace why are you dissatisfied with me8221 sultan told her to pull herself together no one in the family backed him up not even his own sons nevertheless no one dared speak out against him8212he always got his own way sharifa was inconsolable what really rankled was the fact that the man had picked an illiterate someone who had not even completed nursery school she sharifa was a qualified persian language teacher 8220what has she got that i haven8217t got8221 she sobbed sultan rose above his wife8217s tears no one wanted to attend the engagement party but sharifa had to bite the bullet and dress up for the celebrations 8220i want everyone to see that you agree and support me in the future we will all be living under the same roof and you must show that sonya is welcome8221 he demanded sharifa had always humored her husband and now too in this worst circumstance giving him to someone else she knuckled under he even demanded that sharifa should put the rings on his and sonya8217s fingers twenty days after the proposal of marriage the solemn engagement ritual took place sharifa pulled herself together and put on a brave face her female relatives did their best to unsettle her 8220how awful for you8221 they said 8220how badly he has treated you you must be suffering8221 the wedding took place two months after the engagement on the day of the muslim new year8217s eve this time sharifa refused to attend 8220i can8217t8221 she told her husband the female family members backed her up no one bought new dresses or applied the normal amount of makeup required at wedding ceremonies they wore simple coiffures and stiff smiles8212in deference to the superannuated wife who would no longer share sultan khan8217s bed it was now reserved for the young terrified bride8212but they would all be under the same roof until death did them part
