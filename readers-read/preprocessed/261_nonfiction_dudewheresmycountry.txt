 excerpt from chapter 1 introduction i love listening to peoples stories about where they were and what they were doing on the morning of 911 especially the stories from the ones who through luck or fate were allowed to live for instance theres this guy who had just returned the day before from his honeymoon that night on september 10 his new bride thought shed make him her special homemade burrito the burrito was horrible like eating tar stripped off the center line of the major deegan expressway but love ignores all of that and what counts is the gesture not the digestion he told her how grateful he was and how much he loved her and he asked for another the next morning september 11 2001 hes on the subway from brooklyn to his job on one of the top floors of the world trade center the subway might have been heading to manhattan but the burrito was heading south and i dont mean the jersey shore he starts to get sick real sick and decides to get off just one stop before the world trade center he runs up the subway stairs in a desperate search for facilities but this is new york and that was not to be and thus on the corner of park row and broadway he became a poster boy for depends embarrassed and humiliated151but feeling much better151he flagged down a gypsy cab and offered him a hundred dollars to take him home 9 for the ride and 91 toward the price of a new car when the man got home he ran inside to take a shower and to put on a new set of clothes so he could get back to manhattan coming out of the shower he flipped on the tv and as he stood there he watched the plane slam right into the floor where he worked where he would have been right now had his loving wife not made him that wonderful151that absolutely perfectly incredible amazing he broke down and began to cry my own 911 story wasnt so close a call i was asleep in santa monica the phone rang around 630 am and it was my motherin law new york is under attack is what i heard her say through my halfawake ear i wanted to say yeah so whats new and its 630 in the morning new york is at war she continued this made no sense other than again it always feels like war in new york turn on the tv she said and so i did i woke up my wife and as the television faded on there were the towers on fire we tried to call our daughter back home in new york no luck then tried to call our friend joanne who works near the world trade center no luck and then we just sat there stunned we didnt leave the bed or the tv until five that afternoon when we finally found out that our daughter and joanne were okay but a line producer we had just worked with bill weems was not okay as the networks started to run a scroll along the bottom of the tv with the names of those who were on the planes along came bills name on that screen my last memory of him was the two of us horsing around at a funeral home where we were shooting a piece about the tobacco industry put two guys with a dark sense of humor around a bunch of undertakers and youve got what we would call nirvana three months later he was dead and151how do they say it151life as we knew it changed forever really did it how has it changed is there enough distance from that tragic day to ask that question and find an intelligent answer things certainly changed for bills wife and his sevenyearold daughter theres the crime right there to have her daddy taken from her at such a young age and life changed for the loved ones of the other 3000 who were murdered they will never lose the sorrow they feel they are told that they must move on move on to where those of us who have lost someone and i guess thats eventually everyone know that while life does move on the sock in the gut the sorrow in the heart will never leave so ways must be found to embrace it and make it work for you and the living somehow we all work our way through our own personal losses and we get up the next morning and the morning after that and fix the kids breakfast and do another load of laundry and pay the bills and meanwhile in faraway washington dc life is changing too taking advantage of our grief and our fear that it may happen again an appointed president uses the dead of 911 as a convenient cover a justification for permanently altering our american way of life is that why they died so that george w bush can turn the country into texas weve already conducted two wars since 911 and an upcoming third or a fourth is not all that unlikely if this is allowed to continue then all we will have accomplished is to dishonor those 3000plus dead i know bill weems didnt die so he could be used as an excuse to bomb innocents overseas if his death his life is to have a greater meaning from this moment forward it is to make sure that no one else like him will have to lose his or her life in this insane violent world a world we now seem hellbent on running any way we damn well please im lucky i guess that i even get to write these words you are reading not just because i get to live in the most wonderfulest country in the whole wide world but because after 911 my former publisher regan books a division of harpercollins which is a division of the news corp which owns fox news and its all owned by rupert murdoch was trying its hardest to make sure my career as an author would come to an early end the first 50000 copies of stupid white men came off the printing press the day before 911 but when the tragedy struck the next morning the trucks that would carry them to the nations bookstores never left the loading dock the publisher then held the books hostage for five long monthsnot simply out of good taste and respect which i might have been able to understand but out of a desire to censor me and the things i wanted to say they insisted i rewrite up to 50 percent of the book and that i remove sections that they found offensive to our leader mr bush i refused to change a word a standoff ensued until a librarian in new jersey heard me talking about the phone call i had just received from the murdoch publisher telling me that it looked as if they had no choice thanks to my stubbornness but to pulp and recycle all 50000 copies of my book that were gathering dust in a warehouse in scranton pennsylvania i also was told by others not to expect much in the way of a book career after this as word would spread that i was considered trouble a royal pain in the ass who wouldnt play ball this librarian ann sparanese a woman i did not know sent out an email to a list of librarians telling them that my book was being banned her letter shot around the internet and within days letters from angry librarians were flooding regan books i got a call from the murdoch police what did you tell the librarians huh i dont know any librarians yes you do you told them about what we are doing with your book and now were getting hate mail from librarians hmm i replied i guess thats one terrorist group you dont want to mess with fearing there would soon be a crazed mob of wild librarians storming down fifth avenue and surrounding the harpercollins building refusing to leave until either my book was liberated from the scranton warehouse or murdoch himself was drawn and quartered though i would have settled for making bill oreilly wear his underwear on his head for a week the news corp surrendered they dumped my book in some bookstores with no advertising no reviews and the offer of a threecity tour arlington denver somewhere in new jersey in other words the book was sent to the gallows for a quick and painless death its too bad you wouldnt listen to us one murdoch operative told me we were only trying to help you the country is behind george w bush and it is intellectually dishonest of you not to rewrite your book and admit that he has done a good job since 911 you are out of touch with the american people and your book will now suffer as a result of it i was so out of touch with my fellow americans that within hours after the books release it went to number one on amazon151 and within five days it had gone to its ninth printing its in its fiftysecond printing as i write this the worst thing to tell a free people in a country thats still mostly free is that they are not allowed to read something that i was able to be heardand that my book would go on to be the numberone selling nonfiction hardcover book of the year in the united statesscreams volumes about this great country the people will not be intimidated and they will not be bullied by those in charge the american people may look like they dont know whats going on half the time and they may spend too much time picking out differentcolored covers for their cell phones but when push comes to shove theyll rise to the occasion and be there for what is right so here i am now with this new book at none other than aoltimewarner and warner books i know i know when will i learn my lesson but heres the good news during the entire time ive been writing this book aol has been trying to get rid of warner books why would a media company want to get rid of its book division what did warner books do to upset the gods of aol i figure if aol wants to dump these guys they have to be okay plus the other warner folks in this tangled web151warner bros pictures151are the people who distributed my first film roger me they were good and decent and they never threatened to pulp it okay im rationalizing six media companies own everything break up these monopolies for the good of the country the free flow of news and information in a democracy must not be in the hands of just a few rich men yet i have to say they seem to be behind me here 100 percent 1000 percent not once have they said i was trouble but then its not me they really need to worry about its the librarians and you michael moore somewhere over greenland august 15 2003
