 from chapter 2 centuries of memories we were members of the country club and of the church just like other normal working families abi and nathan were members of the swim team and won ribbons at all of the meets where they would chug pink jello sugar before they dove into the frosty waters i was jealous i wanted to do everything my older siblings did they dove off the high dive at the pool and had friends that would give them the equivalent of high fives when they won i really dont know if people gave high fives back then its a trend now thats so silly i cant believe we all do it but we do whenever someone does something good its quothigh fivequot and we smack hands hilarious human behavior is so intriguing i find myself giving thumbsup signs all the time i know i look like an absolute dork but i do it anyway i want to get a trend going where were giving each other thumbsup signs for just being alive and walking down the street sometimes life is so hard and we judge people rather than realizing that its an accomplishment to simply get up in the morning so thumbsup youre awake i was so anxious to learn what abi and nate were doing that one day i climbed to the top of the high dive once there i realized that i was scared out of my mind for some reason my father was there which was a rare occasion he climbed up behind me and pushed me off no warning this was the subtlety of my father maybe he was right after that i dont remember being scared of anything at least not anything that i would admit publicly or in front of him someone at the club must have taken notice because soon after that i was asked to be a replacement on the swim team and i was happily winning ribbons too but the swim team didnt last i dont remember what happened first or last in the series of events that follow the truth is i dont remember a whole lot about this time in my life or the years to come my memories have come back sketchy to say the least somehow our bodies and minds protect us from the whole truth but ill tell you what i know i remember getting a weird feeling when we were at the country club restaurant one night we rarely went out to dinner but we were there and dad was talking to the matre d talking turned to arguing and the next thing i knew dad was pocketing the wonderfultasting butter mints that were sitting on the counter near the exit i dont mean a couple of mints either im talking the entire dish of mints and then we were gone not only from the restaurant but from the club altogether we never swam in the pool or ate in the restaurant again i was in the middle of second grade by this point and dad was disappearing rapidly from our lives he was supposedly going to new york on business his trips were getting more and more frequent the longer we stayed in the house it was very curious to me seeing that the only thing i had ever known my father to do was go out to the garage and look at the fabric samples he had collected yes fabric samples he had tons of them piled high in the garage out back you know those books that you can flip through when youre trying to decide how to redecorate well those books were littered by the hundreds all over the floor along with some carpet samples certainly this was strange for a man who didnt have a job but his excuse was that he wanted to go into interior design and he knew some women who were helping him do just that well mom didnt say much to dad about anything but whenever he brought up those women or the whole interior decorating thing you could tell she was upset if i didnt know christians better i might have thought she hated those women dad had dropped out of medical school when they were in college and mom was pregnant with susan and although it wasnt mentioned often you could hear her disappointment hidden in sentences like quotdonaldquot oh yeah that was his name quotif you had only stayed in school and become a doctor we would have food to put on the table how long do you think i can feed these children on five dollars a weekquot mom rarely spoke to my father that way he would purse his lips like a prissy old woman with no sugar in her tea and stomp away with a condescending quotgood christian women respect their husbands dont ever say that to me again naaannncyyyyquot nancy was her name and when he said it like that she shut up i guess five dollars a week was what he got for playing piano on sundays at our new church that was the only job he seemed to keep that and choir directing he loved choir directing he would sway his arms in the air like a fairy and everyone loved it including my mother he was good at music music and fabric samples so when dad told mom that he was going to new york on business and the business was gas and oil you can imagine her surprise gas and oil thats what i said now how on earth could a choir director from aurora ohio who doesnt have any skills other than knowing what shade of pink complements what shade of black and which notes are played in the key of g find himself in the business of selling gas and oil no one could figure especially not my mother but this was a perfect time to exercise the numberone rule no questions asked was also a rule my mother had to abide by and it was followed quickly by her numbertwo rule good christian women believe anything that their husbands tell them no matter how absurd it may sound this worked out well for my father god knows it was absurd my mother was stuck with a houseful of kids on a few dollars a week while dad went off to new york city on whose tab no one knew to develop a business in gas and oil which he knew nothing about and had never mentioned before in his life we kids of course were kept in the dark about all of it we dutifully did everything we were told and didnt question when dad was out of town on business for weeks at a time because we didnt want to get beaten with a spoon we also didnt question anything when we stepped outside to be driven to school one day and the car was gone just gone no sign of it anywhere and nothing to be said about it dad was out of town so we knew he hadnt run off with it but it was all excused with moms cheery quotim sure its just some sort of mixupquot like good children we nodded our heads in agreement quotsure it is mom just a little mixerupper no worriesquot we trudged back inside and made bread homemade bread always made everyone feel better and it was food that was cheap we sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the buttered stuff and we had sandwiches for a whole week who knows how we got along without a car that part escapes me when dad didnt show up for three weeks claiming that he was snowed in and the airports wouldnt let any planes out i think my mother started to get suspicious the weeks that he had been home the previous months he would fly in on a saturday night tell the kids that they were singing in church the next morning for the congregations entertainment and fly out on sunday night he couldnt rehearse the choir he used to love so much spending as little time at home as he did so we had become the choir dad had taught us to sing on key and we looked cute up on stage in our homemade clothes so why not we sang the same songs over and over our version of a hymn in threepart our fourth was off to college by now harmony and like a good christian congregation no one said a word they like good wives and good children kept their mouths shut and looked like they were enjoying each phrase we sang as if it were the first time they had heard it like the story of jesus turning water into wine christians can listen to anything over and over again and seem to stay interested when i mistakenly asked about this phenomenon one sunday after church i was given the lovely speech my mother so often gave as i pulled up my dress to expose my young rump quotyou know i dont want to be doing this honeyquot then she smacked me raw and sent me upstairs hoping i would once and for all learn the numberone rule quotwhat will it take to get the question mark out of that childs brainquot she must have thought never questioning that she too was questioning and even though she didnt want me to see it i saw it in her eyes
