its simplicity a capsule ward robe capsule living no debris no nasty clothes you never wore but couldnrsquot throw away no intray no dishes full of leaky pens and postit notes with chewing gum stuck to them hotels were anonymous hotels were beautiful if you picked right which after hours and sometimes days looking at hotel web sites on the internet she inevitably did they were temples of luxury or rusticity coziness or design the mundanities of life were taken care of and you were freed from domestic slavery hell no one could bother you you simply put do not disturb on the door handle and the telephone and the world had to bugger off olivia had not always loved hotels most of her family holidays had been taken in a tent until the age of twentytwo her only hotel experience had been of dingy yet embarrassingly formal crowns and majestics in northern british seaside resortsmdashstrangesmelling with bizarrely patterned carpets and wallpapers where the guests spoke in intimidated whispers and forcedly posh accents and her entire family would freeze with shame if one of them dropped a fork or a sausage on the floor the first time she was sent to a hotel on business she didnrsquot know what to do or how to behave but when she found herself in an elegant untouched room with a minibar crisp white cotton sheets room service highend soap no one to answer to and free slippers she felt like shersquod come home sometimes she felt bad about liking hotels so much worried that it made her a spoilt lucky bitch but it wasnrsquot just posh hotels she liked it wasnrsquot really to do with poshness some posh hotels were disgusting snobbish overly fancy not providing the things you needed at all such as phones that worked food that arrived hot on the same date as the one on which it was ordered noisy air conditioning units views of car parks and worst of all snooty unfriendly staff some of her favorite hotels werenrsquot expensive at all the only real criterion of fineness she trusted was whether on arrival the toilet paper was folded into a neat point at the end in the delano it was not only neatly pointed it had a white sticker on saying the delano in cool gray capitals she wasnrsquot sure about the sticker she thought it might be taking things too far she put the case on the bed and started lovingly to unpack the contents that would become her home until she was forced back to london last thing out of the bag as always was her survival tin which she tucked under the pillow it wasnrsquot clever to carry the survival tin through airports but it had been with her for a long time it looked like an old tobacco tin she had bought it in an outdoor adventure shop on the forecourt of euston station the lid was mirrored underneath for signaling the tin had a handle to transform it into a miniature pan inside was an edible candle a condom for water carrying cotton wool potassium permanganate for cleaning wounds and fire lighting fish hooks a rabbit snare a wire saw water proof matches a flint fluorescent tape razor blades a button compass and a miniature flare she hadnrsquot used any of the items except the condommdashwhich had been several times replacedmdashand the cotton wool in the occasional hotel that didnrsquot offer cleansing pads but she was certain that one day the tin would save her by helping her to collect water in the desert strangle a hijacker or signal from a palmmdashfringed atoll to a passing plane until then it was a talismanmdash like a teddy or a handbag olivia had never thought of the world as a particularly safe place she turned back to the window and the view of the beach there was a laminated instruction card hanging from the telescope she looked confusedly at it for a second then gave up and peered into the eyepiece seeing a green blur of magnified grass she adjusted a dial to reveal the seafront upside down she carried on adjusting to the upsidedown world moving downmdashor up mdashto a jogger ugh without a shirt on why boastfully revolt others and a yacht smacking awkwardly into each wave she moved on upsidedownedly side ways until she came to the oceansapart it was like the white cliffs of dover heading for miami she dragged her laptop out of her bag and hanged out an email to barry re fantastic new story 1 miami cool going really well 2 great style story

airportsmdashfive of them stuck in heathrow be cause someone had left a laptop in the ladiesrsquo loo the facecream party was at six she had twenty minutes to transform herself into a dazzling creature of the night fiftyeight minutes later she emerged breathless from the elevator scrubbed and polished a line of white limos stretched from the front of the lobby all the way up the avenue horns blaring the hotel bouncers were in their bossiest of elements throwing their weight around in little white shorts and talking into headsets with the gravitas of fbi agents two girls with huge breasts and no hips were posing with rather desperate grins on a red carpet they looked like weird manwoman hybridsmdashthe upper part buxom female the lower adolescent boy they were striking identical poses standing sideon to the flashbulbs one leg in front of the other bodies forced into an s shape as if they were trying to duplicate a diagram from instyle magazine or were desperate to

of the glossy press packs and headed reading it towards the throng shuddering at the list of repulsivesounding algae and seacritterbased ingredients a woman in a black trouser suit powered over arranging her face into the sort of frightening whitetoothed smile that looks like that of an angry monkey ldquohi yoursquore olivia melissa from century pr welcome how was your trip over how was the

buzz off as soon as possible night had fallen with tropical suddenness the landscaping was lit with flaming torches and beyond was the ocean crashing in the darkness or maybe she thought it was an air conditioning unit there was something odd about this party it felt controlling and tense like melissa the wind was lifting press releases and serviettes ruffling dresses and hair there were people around who didnrsquot fit moving and watching too anxiously for party funland she focused on a group in the far corner trying to figure them out the women were actressmodel types big hair long legs small dresses the men were harder to place darkhaired oliveskinned high mustache quotient they were making a show of being rich but they werenrsquot quite getting it right they looked like an advert froni debenhamrsquos inhouse magazine ldquoif yoursquoll excuse me therersquos someone i need to bring over oh look therersquos jennifer8230rdquo melissa powered off still talking leaving olivia standing on her own for a throwback second she felt residual feelings of insecurity she stamped on them hard as if they were a beetle or cockroach olivia used to hate going to parties she was too sensitive to the signals given off by other people to glide through any social gathering unscathed she liked to have proper conversations not mindless insincere moments and she could never quite master the art of moving smoothly from group to group as a result she used to spend entire evenings feeling either hurt or rude dramatic events however made her decide she would no longer give a shit about anything over time she had painstakingly erased all womanly urges to question her shape looks role in life or effect upon other people she would watch analyze and conform to codes as she ob served them without allowing them to affect or compromise her own identity one of her favorites on her rules for living list was ldquono one is thinking about you theyrsquore thinking about themselves just like yourdquo this was a particularly useful rule at parties it meant by implication that no one was watching you either therefore you could just stand on your own and observe and no one would think you were a sad act no one for example was thinking now that she was olivianomatesjoules just because she was on her own or worse rachelnomatespixley no one would say ldquorachel pixley yoursquore a dropout from worksop comprehensive leave the delano hotel this instant and go to the post house hotel on the nottingham bypassrdquo when rachel pixley was a normal schoolgirl living with two parents in worksop coming home to tea in a warm house she used to think that an orphan was a glamorous thing to be like alona the wild one in bunty or mandy comicsmdashmdashan orphan who was wild and free and galloped her horse bareback along the shoreline for a long time after it all happened she thought she had been punished for this fantasy when rachel was fourteen her mother father and brother were run over by a lorry on a zebra crossing rachel having lagged behind buying sweets and a magazine saw the whole thing she was put in the care of her unmarried auntie monica who had cats and read newspapers all day in her nightdress her flat smelt of something indefinable and bad but despite the fag ash that festooned her like snow and her eccentric and inaccurate application of lipstick auntie monica was beautiful and had been brilliant she had studied at cambridge and still played the piano wonderfullymdashwhen she wasnrsquot drunk playing the piano when drunk as rachel came to realize during the time she spent chez auntie monica was like driving when drunkmdashinadvisable if not criminal rachel had had a boyfriend at school who was a couple of years above her but seemed much older than everyone else his father was a nightwatchman and a maniac roxby was not exactly good looking but he was his own man he used to work nights as a bouncer in romeo and julietrsquos and when he came homemdashbecause by this time he and rachel were living together in a room above the hao wah chinese takeawaymdashhe used to sit at the computer investing his bouncer earnings in stocks and shares rachel who had only ever understood money as something you earned in very small quantities by working was initially resistant to the notion of making money out of money ldquomoney doesnrsquot buy happinessrdquo her hardworking father had told her ldquoif you work hard and yoursquore honest and kind then nothing can harm yourdquo but it had a lorry had run over him so rachel threw in her lot with roxby and worked every weekend at morrisonsrsquo supermarket and did evening shifts after school in a corner shop run by a pakistani family and let him invest the money for her when she turned sixteen her fatherrsquos life insurance policy was turned over to her she had twenty thousand pounds to invest it was the beginning of the eighties she was on the way to becoming if not a rich woman at least a woman of independent means when she was seventeen roxby announced that he was gay and moved to the canal district of manchester and rachel fed up with knock after knock took a long hard look at life she had seen her friendsrsquo older sisters radiant and triumphant flashing minuscule h samuelrsquos solitaires on their engagement fingers spending months obsessed with dresses flowers and event planning only to be found a couple of years later in the shopping center fat broke and hassled pushing prams through the rain moaning about being hit or belittled or left and she thought sod that she started with her name ldquooliviardquo sounded glam and the attractiveness of the word ldquojoulesrdquo was the only thing she remembered from physics lessons irsquom all irsquove got she thought irsquom going to be complete in myself irsquom going to work out my own good and bad irsquom going to be a top journalist or an explorer and do something that matters irsquom going to search this shitty world for some beauty and excitement and irsquom going to have a bloody good time and this olivia joules thought leaning back against the delano pillar is a lot more beautiful and exciting than worksop no one is watching you just go with the flow and enjoy it unfortunately for the rule for living however somebody was watching her as she continued to scan the party a pair of eyes met hers in a second of highly charged interest then looked away she also looked away then glanced back the man was standing alone he was dark and rather aristocraticlooking he was wearing a suit that was a bit too black and a shirt that was a bit too whitemdashtoo flash for the delano and yet he didnrsquot look like a flash person there was a stillness about him he turned and suddenly his eyes met hers again with that thrilling unspoken message which sometimes transmits itself across a room and says ldquoi want to fuck you toordquo that was all that was needed a look no need to flirt to maneuver to chat just that moment of recognition then all you had to do was follow like in a dance ldquoeverything going okayrdquo it was the hyperactive pr woman olivia realizing she was staring lustfully into space remembered that she had a piece to file by tomorrow and had better get on with it ldquotherersquos lots of people i want you to meetrdquo said melissa starting to bustle olivia along ldquohave you had something to eat let me see if wersquove got some people for you to talk to have you met devoreacuteerdquo putting thoughts of shagging strangers firmly to one side she turned her attention to the business of quotegathering everyone wanted to be in british elan and the launch was easy pickings for sound bites after an hour or so she had vaguely facecreambased quotes from devoreacutee chris blackwell the manager of the delano a couple of handsome men whom she suspected were for hire the guy who did the list at tantra the pr for michael kors and p diddy it was more than enough for the solitary paragraph which would inevitably prove the sum total of elanrsquos coverage moving on to the sunday times ldquocool miamirdquo piece she quickly filled her notebook with the grandmother of one of the models who had lived on the south shore strip twenty years before it became fashionable again a cop who claimed to have been on the scene after the versace shooting and was plainly lying andmdashmdashla piegravece de reacutesistancemdashgianni versacersquos former cleaning lady ldquooliviardquo damn it was melissa again ldquocan i introduce

been watching her he was a compelling mixture of soulful and powerful finely drawn features a straight nose fine arched brows hooded brown eyes ldquothis is pierre ferramordquo she was disappointed the name sounded like something yoursquod find in giltplastic faux handwriting pinned on an overpriced tie in a dutyfree shop ldquoms joulesrdquo he was wearing a ridiculously overthetop gold watch but his hand was rougher than she expected and the hand shake strong ldquopleased to meet yourdquo she said ldquocongratulations on cregraveme de phylgie does it really contain sea slugsrdquo he didnrsquot laugh he glinted ldquonot the sea slugs themselves only an essence an oil secreted by their skinrdquo ldquoit sounds like something yoursquod want to wipe off rather than put onrdquo ldquodoes it indeedrdquo he raised his eyebrows ldquoi hope you wonrsquot be writing that in your piecerdquo trilled melissa with a brittle laugh ldquoirsquom sure ms joules will write with infinite

pierre i just want you to say hello to one of our very special guests before she leavesrdquo ldquovery wellrdquo he said wearily murmuring to olivia as he left ldquosea slugs indeedrdquo melissa introduced olivia to more of her client base two members of a boy band called break whose gimmick was surfing and who had a ldquobeach boys meets radiohead fusion viberdquo olivia had never heard of the band but the two boys were rather sweet beneath the surfwhite hair their complexions displayed a fascinating mixture of sunburnt crispiness and acne she listened as they chattered on about their careers beavisandbuttheadtype nervous sniggers punctuating a fragile veneer of bored arrogance ldquowersquore auditioning for parts in this like movie with surfersrdquo their strange interrogatory intonation seemed to suggest that someone as old as olivia might not understand words like ldquomovierdquo or ldquosurfersrdquo ldquoitrsquos going to launch the single off the albumrdquo two hits and theyrsquod be off but they didnrsquot know it she felt like giving them a motherly chat but instead she just listened and nodded watching pierre ferramo out of the corner of her eye ldquothatrsquos the guy whorsquos like the producer of the movierdquo whispered one of the boys ldquoreallyrdquo they all watched as ferramo made his stately way towards a mysteriouslooking group of dark men and models he moved gracefully languid almost to the point of being fey but exuding a sense of tremendous latent power he reminded her of someone the group parted like the red sea to receive him as if he were a guru or god rather than a face cream creator slash producer slash whatever he settled himself down gracefully crossing one leg over the other revealing an expanse of bare leg black shiny slipons and thin silky gray socks a couple close to the group rose to leave their sofa ldquoshall we sit a bit nearerrdquo said olivia nodding towards the empty seats it was a silly toobig sofa so olivia and the surf boys had almost to climb onto it and then either virtually lie down or sit with their legs dangling like children ferramo looked up as she sat and graciously inclined his head she felt her senses quicken and looked away she breathed slowly remembering her scubadiving training just keep breathing deep breaths be cool at all times she turned back to the boys crossing her legs and smoothing her hand across her thigh she moistened her lips laughed and played for a second with the delicate diamond and sapphire cross at her throat she could feel his eyes on her she raised her lashes preparing to look straight into those penetrating dark eyes oh pierre ferramo was staring down the cleavage of the tall unbelievably beautiful indian model on his other side he said something to her and the two of them rose his arm around her his hand on her hip guiding her away from the table olivia looked at one of the spotty boys he leaned forward and whispered ldquoit was doing it for merdquo and traced a tiny circle with his finger on her thigh she laughed her deep throaty laugh and closed her eyes it had been a while halfway across the terrace pierre ferramo heard oliviarsquos laugh and raised his head like an animal catching a scent he turned to melissa who was hovering at his elbow and murmured a few words to her then he continued his dignified progress towards the lobby the tall silkenhaired indian model at his side as she sipped her apple martini olivia was struggling to think who it was that ferramo reminded her of the hooded eyes the sense of intelligence and power the languid movements she felt a hand on her arm and jumped ldquooliviardquo it was the wretched melissa ldquomr ferramo would like you to join him for a small private party he is having in his

herself in an elegant untouched room with a minibar crisp white cotton sheets room service highend soap no one to answer to and free slippers she felt like shersquod come home sometimes she felt bad about liking hotels so much worried that it made her a spoilt lucky bitch but it wasnrsquot just posh hotels she liked it wasnrsquot really to do with poshness some posh hotels were disgusting snobbish overly fancy not providing the things you needed at all such as phones that worked food that arrived hot on the same date as the one on which it was ordered noisy air conditioning units views of car parks and worst of all snooty unfriendly staff some of her favorite hotels werenrsquot expensive at all the only real criterion of fineness she trusted was whether on arrival the toilet paper was folded into a neat point at the end in the delano it was not only neatly pointed it had a white sticker on saying the delano in cool gray capitals she wasnrsquot sure about the sticker she thought it might be taking things too far she put the case on the bed and started lovingly to unpack the contents that would become her home until she was forced back to london last thing out of the bag as always was her survival tin which she tucked under the pillow it wasnrsquot clever to carry the survival tin through airports but it had been with her for a long time it looked like an old tobacco tin she had bought it in an outdoor adventure shop on the forecourt of euston station the lid was mirrored underneath for signaling the tin had a handle to transform it into a miniature pan inside was an edible candle a condom for water carrying cotton wool potassium permanganate for cleaning wounds and fire lighting fish hooks a rabbit snare a wire saw water proof matches a flint fluorescent tape razor blades a button compass and a miniature flare she hadnrsquot used any of the items except the condommdashwhich had been several times replacedmdashand the cotton wool in the occasional hotel that didnrsquot offer cleansing pads but she was certain that one day the tin would save her by helping her to collect water in the desert strangle a hijacker or signal from a palmmdashfringed atoll to a passing plane until then it was a talismanmdash like a teddy or a handbag olivia had never thought of the world as a particularly safe place she turned back to the window and the view of the beach there was a laminated instruction card hanging from the telescope she looked confusedly at it for a second then gave up and peered into the eyepiece seeing a green blur of magnified grass she adjusted a dial to reveal the seafront upside down she carried on adjusting to the upsidedown world moving downmdashor up mdashto a jogger ugh without a shirt on why boastfully revolt others and a yacht smacking awkwardly into each wave she moved on upsidedownedly side ways until she came to the oceansapart it was like the white cliffs of dover heading for miami she dragged her laptop out of her bag and hanged out an email to barry re fantastic new story 1 miami cool going really well 2 great style story oceansapartmdashobscenely large new floating apartment blockmdashdocked in miami on maiden voyage 3 can cover but would need one or ideally two more nights here over and out olivia she read it nodding with satisfaction pressed ldquosendrsquo then looked up at the mirror and started her hair was quite mad and her face horrifying in its puffiness the product of sixteen hours spent in planes and airportsmdashfive of them stuck in heathrow be cause someone had left a laptop in the ladiesrsquo loo the facecream party was at six she had twenty minutes to transform herself into a dazzling creature of the night fiftyeight minutes later she emerged breathless from the elevator scrubbed and polished a line of white limos stretched from the front of the lobby all the way up the avenue horns blaring the hotel bouncers were in their bossiest of elements throwing their weight around in little white shorts and talking into headsets with the gravitas of fbi agents two girls with huge breasts and no hips were posing with rather desperate grins on a red carpet they looked like weird manwoman hybridsmdashthe upper part buxom female the lower adolescent boy they were striking identical poses standing sideon to the flashbulbs one leg in front of the other bodies forced into an s shape as if they were trying to duplicate a diagram from instyle magazine or were desperate to go to the loo the greeting table displayed a precarious pyramid of tubs of devoreacuteemdashcrecircme de phylgie very surgicallooking plain white with plain green writing olivia gave her name took one of the glossy press packs and headed reading it towards the throng shuddering at the list of repulsivesounding algae and seacritterbased ingredients a woman in a black trouser suit powered over arranging her face into the sort of frightening whitetoothed smile that looks like that of an angry monkey ldquohi yoursquore olivia melissa from century pr welcome how was your trip over how was the weather in londonrdquo she marched olivia towards the terrace asking inane and ceaseless questions without pause for answer ldquohow is your hotel room howrsquos sally at elan will you give her my regardsrdquo they stepped out on the deck where le tout fashionista and musico miami monde was artfully arranged around a selection of wrongsized furniture and spilling down some steps into the garden below where whitecovered comfy chairs giant indoor table lamps and cabanas surrounded the turquoiselit pool ldquohave you tried the devoreacutee martini you got the press release about the chef whorsquos prepared the special dishes wersquoll be sampling tonightrdquo olivia let melissarsquos autowitter wash over her usually she tried to let annoying people do their thing and hoped theyrsquod buzz off as soon as possible night had fallen with tropical suddenness the landscaping was lit with flaming torches and beyond was the ocean crashing in the darkness or maybe she thought it was an air conditioning unit there was something odd about this party it felt controlling and tense like melissa the wind was lifting press releases and serviettes ruffling dresses and hair there were people around who didnrsquot fit moving and watching too anxiously for party funland she focused on a group in the far corner trying to figure them out the women were actressmodel types big hair long legs small dresses the men were harder to place darkhaired oliveskinned high mustache quotient they were making a show of being rich but they werenrsquot quite getting it right they looked like an advert froni debenhamrsquos inhouse magazine ldquoif yoursquoll excuse me therersquos someone i need to bring over oh look therersquos jennifer8230rdquo melissa powered off still talking leaving olivia standing on her own for a throwback second she felt residual feelings of insecurity she stamped on them hard as if they were a beetle or cockroach olivia used to hate going to parties she was too sensitive to the signals given off by other people to glide through any social gathering unscathed she liked to have proper conversations not mindless insincere moments and she could never quite master the art of moving smoothly from group to group as a result she used to spend entire evenings feeling either hurt or rude dramatic events however made her decide she would no longer give a shit about anything over time she had painstakingly erased all womanly urges to question her shape looks role in life or effect upon other people she would watch analyze and conform to codes as she ob served them without allowing them to affect or compromise her own identity one of her favorites on her rules for living list was ldquono one is thinking about you theyrsquore thinking about themselves just like yourdquo this was a particularly useful rule at parties it meant by implication that no one was watching you either therefore you could just stand on your own and observe and no one would think you were a sad act no one for example was thinking now that she was olivianomatesjoules just because she was on her own or worse rachelnomatespixley no one would say ldquorachel pixley yoursquore a dropout from worksop comprehensive leave the delano hotel this instant and go to the post house hotel on the nottingham bypassrdquo when rachel pixley was a normal schoolgirl living with two parents in worksop coming home to tea in a warm house she used to think that an orphan was a glamorous thing to be like alona the wild one in bunty or mandy comicsmdashmdashan orphan who was wild and free and galloped her horse bareback along the shoreline for a long time after it all happened she thought she had been punished for this fantasy when rachel was fourteen her mother father and brother were run over by a lorry on a zebra crossing rachel having lagged behind buying sweets and a magazine saw the whole thing she was put in the care of her unmarried auntie monica who had cats and read newspapers all day in her nightdress her flat smelt of something indefinable and bad but despite the fag ash that festooned her like snow and her eccentric and inaccurate application of lipstick auntie monica was beautiful and had been brilliant she had studied at cambridge and still played the piano wonderfullymdashwhen she wasnrsquot drunk playing the piano when drunk as rachel came to realize during the time she spent chez auntie monica was like driving when drunkmdashinadvisable if not criminal rachel had had a boyfriend at school who was a couple of years above her but seemed much older than everyone else his father was a nightwatchman and a maniac roxby was not exactly good looking but he was his own man he used to work nights as a bouncer in romeo and julietrsquos and when he came homemdashbecause by this time he and rachel were living together in a room above the hao wah chinese takeawaymdashhe used to sit at the computer investing his bouncer earnings in stocks and shares rachel who had only ever understood money as something you earned in very small quantities by working was initially resistant to the notion of making money out of money ldquomoney doesnrsquot buy happinessrdquo her hardworking father had told her ldquoif you work hard and yoursquore honest and kind then nothing can harm yourdquo but it had a lorry had run over him so rachel threw in her lot with roxby and worked every weekend at morrisonsrsquo supermarket and did evening shifts after school in a corner shop run by a pakistani family and let him invest the money for her when she turned sixteen her fatherrsquos life insurance policy was turned over to her she had twenty thousand pounds to invest it was the beginning of the eighties she was on the way to becoming if not a rich woman at least a woman of independent means when she was seventeen roxby announced that he was gay and moved to the canal district of manchester and rachel fed up with knock after knock took a long hard look at life she had seen her friendsrsquo older sisters radiant and triumphant flashing minuscule h samuelrsquos solitaires on their engagement fingers spending months obsessed with dresses flowers and event planning only to be found a couple of years later in the shopping center fat broke and hassled pushing prams through the rain moaning about being hit or belittled or left and she thought sod that she started with her name ldquooliviardquo sounded glam and the attractiveness of the word ldquojoulesrdquo was the only thing she remembered from physics lessons irsquom all irsquove got she thought irsquom going to be complete in myself irsquom going to work out my own good and bad irsquom going to be a top journalist or an explorer and do something that matters irsquom going to search this shitty world for some beauty and excitement and irsquom going to have a bloody good time and this olivia joules thought leaning back against the delano pillar is a lot more beautiful and exciting than worksop no one is watching you just go with the flow and enjoy it unfortunately for the rule for living however somebody was watching her as she continued to scan the party a pair of eyes met hers in a second of highly charged interest then looked away she also looked away then glanced back the man was standing alone he was dark and rather aristocraticlooking he was wearing a suit that was a bit too black and a shirt that was a bit too whitemdashtoo flash for the delano and yet he didnrsquot look like a flash person there was a stillness about him he turned and suddenly his eyes met hers again with that thrilling unspoken message which sometimes transmits itself across a room and says ldquoi want to fuck you toordquo that was all that was needed a look no need to flirt to maneuver to chat just that moment of recognition then all you had to do was follow like in a dance ldquoeverything going okayrdquo it was the hyperactive pr woman olivia realizing she was staring lustfully into space remembered that she had a piece to file by tomorrow and had better get on with it ldquotherersquos lots of people i want you to meetrdquo said melissa starting to bustle olivia along ldquohave you had something to eat let me see if wersquove got some people for you to talk to have you met devoreacuteerdquo putting thoughts of shagging strangers firmly to one side she turned her attention to the business of quotegathering everyone wanted to be in british elan and the launch was easy pickings for sound bites after an hour or so she had vaguely facecreambased quotes from devoreacutee chris blackwell the manager of the delano a couple of handsome men whom she suspected were for hire the guy who did the list at tantra the pr for michael kors and p diddy it was more than enough for the solitary paragraph which would inevitably prove the sum total of elanrsquos coverage moving on to the sunday times ldquocool miamirdquo piece she quickly filled her notebook with the grandmother of one of the models who had lived on the south shore strip twenty years before it became fashionable again a cop who claimed to have been on the scene after the versace shooting and was plainly lying andmdashmdashla piegravece de reacutesistancemdashgianni versacersquos former cleaning lady ldquooliviardquo damn it was melissa again ldquocan i introduce you to the creator of devoreacuteersquos cregraveme de phylgie though of course devoreacutee has selected the ingredients personally herselfrdquo olivia let out an odd noise it was the man who had been watching her he was a compelling mixture of soulful and powerful finely drawn features a straight nose fine arched brows hooded brown eyes ldquothis is pierre ferramordquo she was disappointed the name sounded like something yoursquod find in giltplastic faux handwriting pinned on an overpriced tie in a dutyfree shop ldquoms joulesrdquo he was wearing a ridiculously overthetop gold watch but his hand was rougher than she expected and the hand shake strong ldquopleased to meet yourdquo she said ldquocongratulations on cregraveme de phylgie does it really contain sea slugsrdquo he didnrsquot laugh he glinted ldquonot the sea slugs themselves only an essence an oil secreted by their skinrdquo ldquoit sounds like something yoursquod want to wipe off rather than put onrdquo ldquodoes it indeedrdquo he raised his eyebrows ldquoi hope you wonrsquot be writing that in your piecerdquo trilled melissa with a brittle laugh ldquoirsquom sure ms joules will write with infinite subtlety and gracerdquo ldquoinfiniterdquo she said there was an extremely charged pause melissa looked from one to the other then started twittering ldquooh look shersquos leaving will you excuse us pierre i just want you to say hello to one of our very special guests before she leavesrdquo ldquovery wellrdquo he said wearily murmuring to olivia as he left ldquosea slugs indeedrdquo melissa introduced olivia to more of her client base two members of a boy band called break whose gimmick was surfing and who had a ldquobeach boys meets radiohead fusion viberdquo olivia had never heard of the band but the two boys were rather sweet beneath the surfwhite hair their complexions displayed a fascinating mixture of sunburnt crispiness and acne she listened as they chattered on about their careers beavisandbuttheadtype nervous sniggers punctuating a fragile veneer of bored arrogance ldquowersquore auditioning for parts in this like movie with surfersrdquo their strange interrogatory intonation seemed to suggest that someone as old as olivia might not understand words like ldquomovierdquo or ldquosurfersrdquo ldquoitrsquos going to launch the single off the albumrdquo two hits and theyrsquod be off but they didnrsquot know it she felt like giving them a motherly chat but instead she just listened and nodded watching pierre ferramo out of the corner of her eye ldquothatrsquos the guy whorsquos like the producer of the movierdquo whispered one of the boys ldquoreallyrdquo they all watched as ferramo made his stately way towards a mysteriouslooking group of dark men and models he moved gracefully languid almost to the point of being fey but exuding a sense of tremendous latent power he reminded her of someone the group parted like the red sea to receive him as if he were a guru or god rather than a face cream creator slash producer slash whatever he settled himself down gracefully crossing one leg over the other revealing an expanse of bare leg black shiny slipons and thin silky gray socks a couple close to the group rose to leave their sofa ldquoshall we sit a bit nearerrdquo said olivia nodding towards the empty seats it was a silly toobig sofa so olivia and the surf boys had almost to climb onto it and then either virtually lie down or sit with their legs dangling like children ferramo looked up as she sat and graciously inclined his head she felt her senses quicken and looked away she breathed slowly remembering her scubadiving training just keep breathing deep breaths be cool at all times she turned back to the boys crossing her legs and smoothing her hand across her thigh she moistened her lips laughed and played for a second with the delicate diamond and sapphire cross at her throat she could feel his eyes on her she raised her lashes preparing to look straight into those penetrating dark eyes oh pierre ferramo was staring down the cleavage of the tall unbelievably beautiful indian model on his other side he said something to her and the two of them rose his arm around her his hand on her hip guiding her away from the table olivia looked at one of the spotty boys he leaned forward and whispered ldquoit was doing it for merdquo and traced a tiny circle with his finger on her thigh she laughed her deep throaty laugh and closed her eyes it had been a while halfway across the terrace pierre ferramo heard oliviarsquos laugh and raised his head like an animal catching a scent he turned to melissa who was hovering at his elbow and murmured a few words to her then he continued his dignified progress towards the lobby the tall silkenhaired indian model at his side as she sipped her apple martini olivia was struggling to think who it was that ferramo reminded her of the hooded eyes the sense of intelligence and power the languid movements she felt a hand on her arm and jumped ldquooliviardquo it was the wretched melissa ldquomr ferramo would like you to join him for a small private party he is having in his apartment tomorrow nightrdquo olivia could hardly breathe the small hairs were rising on the back of her neck and her forearms ldquoall rightrdquo she said brave and resolute eyes darting this way and that in terror ldquoi shall be thererdquo melissa looked at her oddly ldquoitrsquos only a partyrdquo but olivia had suddenly realized exactly who ferramo reminded her of it was osama bin laden
