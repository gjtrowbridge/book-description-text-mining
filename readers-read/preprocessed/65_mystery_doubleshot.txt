 chapter excerpt chapter one its a funny thing about being hit in the head afterward youre never quite sure what happened you only know that something did at five in the morning on june the seventh i was pushing my dessertladen old pie wagon up the walk to the roundhouse a failed restaurant id leased and was converting into a cateringevents center at halfpast five i was lying in the grass wondering what i was doing there and why i was in so much pain reconstruct i ordered myself as i wiped gravel from my mouth i hadnt fainted but i had been knocked out my head throbbed my knees stung and the back of my neck felt as if it had been guillotined with a dull blade i groaned tried to move my legs and was rewarded with a wave of nausea i rubbed my eyes and tried to think but the memory remained out of reach my husband a cop often tells witnesses to begin their story at daybreak on the day they see a crime this gives folks a chance to talk about how normal everything was before events went haywire so thats what i did i closed my eyes and recalled rising at four when mountain chickadees stellers jays and all manner of avian creatures begin their summerintherockies concert i showered did my yoga and kissed tom to whom id been married for two years goodbye he mumbled that hed be in his office at the sheriffs department later in the day when i checked on my son arch he was slumbering deeply inside his cocoon of dark blue sheets i knew arch would wait until the last possible moment before getting dressed to assist with that days catered event but at least he was helping out which was more than most fifteenyearolds would be willing to do at the start of summer vacation i loaded the last of the events foodstuffs into my catering van made the short drive up aspen meadows main street and rounded the lake a quarter mile along upper cottonwood creek drive i turned into the paved roundhouse lot where id parked and unloaded so far so good i remembered merrily wheeling my cart up the gravel path toward the back door of my newly remodeled commercial kitchen peach pie slices glistened between lattices of flaky crust a hundred smooth golden tennessee chess tartlets bobbled in their packing threads of early morning sunlight shimmered on the surface of aspen meadow lake two hundred yards away in the distance a flock of ducks took off from the lake quacking flapping their wings and ruffling the water recalling all this made the area behind my eyes sting but when i tried to turn over pain ran up my side and i gasped the desserts the lake the ducks then what as id steered the wagon toward the ramp to the back entry id noticed something odd about the roundhouse kitchen door it was slightly ajar a thread of fear had raced up my neck my body turned cold and i stopped the cart whose creaky wheels had been filling the morning silence a thump echoed from out of the kitchen then a crack as i reeled back on the path someone leaped out of the kitchen door a man a woman whoever it was wore a black top black pants and a ski mask the intruder lunged down the ramp wrenching the pie wagon backward i teetered then backpedaled furiously he was it a man shoved the cart out of the way it toppled over pastries spewed onto the grass the prowler loomed then handchopped the back of my neck the force of the blow made me cry out with silver spots clouding my eyes id registered crumpling then falling id bitten my tongue and tasted blood then there had been the terrible pain and the darkness okay so that was what had happened but why had someone wearing a mask been in my kitchen in the first place i did not know what i did know was that lumps of granite and sharp blades of droughtravaged scrub grass were piercing my chest again i tried to lift myself but a current of pain ran down my body when i thought you have an event to cater in six hours tears popped out of my eyes who could have done this to me why today of all days my business goldilocks catering where everything is just right was set to put on only our second event since id leased the roundhouse it was a big lunch following a funeral a funeral that might as well have been mine water burbled nearby cottonwood creek a foot below its normal flow a car rumbled past the beginning of the morning commuter traffic from the stone and stucco minimansions that ranged along the upper part of the creek positioned as i was on the far side of the roundhouse it was unlikely that any of the lawyers accountants or doctors making their way down to denver would see me and call for help with enormous effort i pushed up to my elbows fought queasiness and got to my feet the overturned pie cart lay a few feet away crusts and fruit slices littered the sparse grass tartlet filling oozed into the dust i almost thought peachy but stopped myself i limped to the van and climbed inside then i locked the doors opened the glove compartment and pulled out the thirtyeight id started keeping in there since the twentysecond of april that was when my exhusband dr john richard korman had had his prison sentence commuted by the governor of colorado he had been serving four years for aggravated assault and probation violation although hed beaten me up plenty of times before id kicked him out seven years ago the assault hed been convicted for finally had been his attack on a subsequent girlfriend unfortunately hed been behind bars for less than a year
