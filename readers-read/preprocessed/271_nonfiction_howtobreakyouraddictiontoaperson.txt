 1 prisoner of love maybe the surgeon general hasnt determined it yet but staying in a bad relationship may be dangerous to your health it can shake your selfesteem and destroy your selfconfidence as surely as smoking can damage your lungs when people say that their relationship with their partnera lover or spouseis killing them it may be true the tensions and chemical changes caused by stress can throw any of your organ systems out of kilter can drain your energy and lower your resistance to all manner of unfriendly bugs and often it can drive one to the overuse of unhealthy escapes such as alcohol amphetamines barbiturates narcotics tranquilizers reckless pursuits and even overt suicidal acts but even if there were no threat to your health staying too long in a relationship that is deadening or deadly can cloud your life with frustration anger emptiness and despair you may have tried to improve it to breathe life back into it but you have found that your efforts have been futileand demoralizing you are certainly not alone many basically rational and practical people find that they are unable to leave a relationship even though they can see that it is bad for them their best judgment and their selfrespect tell them to end it but often to their dismay they hang on they speak and act as if something were holding them back as if their relationship was a prison and they were locked in friends and psychotherapists may have pointed out to them that in reality their quotprison doorquot is wide open and that all they need do is step outside and yet as desperately unhappy as they are they hold back some of them approach the threshold then hesitate some may make brief sallies outside but quickly retreat to the safety of prison in relief and despair something in them wants out something in them knows that they were not meant to live this way yet people in droves choose to remain in their prisons making no effort to change themexcept perhaps to hang pretty curtains over the bars and paint the walls in decorator colors they may end up dying in a corner of their cell without having really been alive for years every day i listen to the struggles of men and women who feel imprisoned in unsatisfying relationships alice im slowly growing crazy with burt hes so cut off from his feelings and so unresponsive to me that i feel im with a robot in the beginning he was kind of romantic but now theres nothing coming from him but silence and disinterest when i complain he says thats the way he is even though im so frustrated and miserable i cant get myself to leave him in fact i get very frightened when i think about it seriously jason dee is irresponsible and selfish much of the time shell put me down before other people and sometimes flirt with other men right in front of me if i get annoyed she accuses me of trying to suffocate her but ive checked it out with my friends and they say that she really does give me a hard timeso much so that they sometimes wince for me at this point i cant see anything she gives me yet whatever is binding me to her seems stronger than i am maureen i know brad will never leave his wife i see that im destroying myself and wasting years of my life by staying involved with him but each time ive tried to end it the hell i went through was unbearable and back i would go i feel he owns me mitchell i dont know how it happens but everything is a battle an awful guttwisting fight we get into power struggles over every little thing from what movie to see to how much the window should be opened i think the only thing lara and i agree on is that wed be better off without each other but we cant let go jo anne i stopped loving dennis years ago most nights i dread his coming home but we have so much togetherthe house the kids memories and maybe just plain habitso that as much as i want out the thought of his no longer being in my life and of all id have to go through to end it makes me hang in there for another year and then another year and another im becoming resigned that this is all there is for me but i feel dead arthur the truth is i dont love betsy at least not enough to marry her but i cant break it off i avoid meeting new women because i expect them to reject me and that possibility terrifies me so i guess i hold on to betsy because shes there i like knowing that at least there is someone who really cares about whether i get hit by a truck and who i can share all those little things that happen during the day like just missing my bus or getting a new shirtthings that nobody else would give a damn about eileen why do i keep seeing peter when he treats me so badly hes really cruel to me and totally selfcentered i practice telling him its over in a hundred ways quoti love you but the relationship is not good for mequot quotthis isnt workingquot quoti dont want to see you anymorequot quotive outgrown my need for youquot quotget lost you selfish sobquot quotdrop deadquot and sometimes i do say these things and i do end itfor a week the power of selfdeception all of these people really believe it would be better for them to leave the relationship but when it comes to doing so they are paralyzed in order to remain in the relationship knowing it is against their own best interests they frequently try to trick themselves by distorting the situation they rationalize using quotgoodquot reasons to conceal other possibly unconscious reasons alice who is quotslowly going crazyquot with burts distance and disinterest i know he really loves me beneath his coldness he just has difficulty showing it why else would he not want to break up jason who finds dee selfish and hurtful i know she often seems cruel and insensitive but maybe its just that im being too sensitive and expecting too much maureen who knows brad will never leave his wife sometimes it feels so good between us and he seems so loving that i cant believe hed be stupid enough to stay with her mitchell who fights with lara about every little thing maybe the fact that we fight so much shows how much we love each other jo anne who stopped loving dennis long ago maybe love isnt very important maybe this is all there really is for anyone arthur who doesnt love betsy enough to marry her there arent many women out there whom i would be attracted to and who would be attracted to me eileen who finds peter treats her cruelly its not that he doesnt love me hes just afraid of commitment rationalization is not the only selfdeceptive technique people sometimes hold deeply entrenched feelings and beliefs that defy logic and worse can blur judgment as to what is in ones own healthy selfinterest alice if i leave burt i know ill be alone forever and thats the most frightening thing i can imagine jason dee often treats me like dirt every word is a complaint a criticism or a command but i love her i feel i couldnt live without her maureen sometimes i have this fantasy that ill marry someone else and brad will stay with his wife but that we will remain lovers forever its in our stars mitchell i know that we cant talk for two minutes without fighting but when you feel the way i do about lara you can always work it out jo anne every time i think of leaving i feel overcome by guilt arthur who else would want me eileen peter says he doesnt love me anymore but it just cant be he loved me once and it just doesnt disappear he has to love me some of these statements may sound so familiar it is hard to see whats wrong with them youve heard them from people you know youve read them in romantic novels youve heard them in films plays and songs perhaps you are using them now to barter away your happiness if you are you must ask what are you protecting what are you afraid of what are the real reasons that lie behind the quotgoodquot reasons quotsomething takes hold of mequot eileen is an attractive and talented twentyeightyearold editor of a womans magazine she had come to see me for psychotherapy because her physician had told her that her skin rashes and difficulty sleeping were emotional in origin for the past two years she had been involved with peter a dynamic and successful architect and it was during this time that her symptoms had developed it was easy to see why at best peter treated her badly often he was cruel and eileen would put up with his treatment they would have a date and hed fail to show up then he might call about 2 am make a weak excuse and tell her to quotgrab a cab and come overquot and she would get out of bed dress and take a taxi to his apartment in one session eileen came in glowing because peter uncharacteristically had asked her to go away with him to a resort for the weekend but at the next session she was depressed and bitter as they were on their way to what she had believed would be a romantic holiday peter informed her that he would be attending a business conference and that she would be alone most of the time she had been furious she yelled at him and cried but as so often before he just accused her of being too demanding when they returned from the weekend she told him that she couldnt take it anymore and that she didnt want to see him again he shrugged and left in less than a week in five days of agony sleeplessness despair and a blotchy rash she found herself dialing his number willing to go back on the most humiliating terms quotits like something takes hold of mequot she cried what is it that takes hold of her why does this capable and otherwise rational woman remain so intensely involved with a man who is consistently rejecting who repeatedly causes her pain why when she tries to give up this relationship does she experience even more acute torment addiction to a person looked at closely eileens attachment to peter has all the characteristics of an addiction i am not using the term quotaddictionquot symbolically or metaphorically not only is it possible but it is extremely common for one person in a love relationship to become addicted to the other stanton peele in his book love and addiction recognized the addictive nature of some love relationships reviewing many studies of drug addiction he noted a frequent conclusionthat the addicting element is not so much in the substance such as alcohol or tobacco or a narcotic but in the person who is addicted in love relationships this addictive element takes the form of a compelling need to connect with and to remain connected with a particular person but is this need always an addiction why call it an addiction at all why not simply call it love or preference or a sense of commitment often there is a lot of love and commitment in an addictive relationship but to be genuinely loving and committed one must freely choose another person and one of the hallmarks of an addiction is that it is a compulsive drive which by definition means that it limits this freedom the alcoholic or drug addict feels driven toward the addictive substance even when he knows it is bad for him and when there is a strong addictive element in a relationship the feeling is quoti must have this person and i must remain attached to this person even if this relationship is bad for mequot so the first indication that we are dealing with an addiction is its compulsive quality the second is the panic one feels at the possible absence of the substance alcoholics often feel panic when they are not sure where the next drink is coming from drug addicts experience this fear when their supply of drugs is running out nicotine addicts may become very uneasy about being in a place where smoking is not permitted and people in an addictive relationship may experience overwhelming panic at the thought of breaking the relationship i have often heard of people sitting at the telephone and beginning to dial the number of their partner in an unhappy love affair determined to tell him or her that it is all over but their anxiety becomes so great they have to hang up the third hallmark of an addiction is the withdrawal symptoms as bad as the panic is in contemplating or moving toward a possible breakup it cannot compare to the devastation when the breakup actually happens a person who has just ended an addictive relationship may suffer greater agony than drug addicts smokers and alcoholics endure when they go cold turkey and in many ways the reaction is similar often for example there is physical pain the chest stomach and abdomen are particularly reactive weeping sleep disturbances some people cant sleep others may sleep too much irritability depression and the feeling that there is no place to go and no way to end the discomfort except to go back to the old substance person the craving can become so intense it often defeats the sufferers best intentions and drives him right back to the source of his addiction the fourth hallmark of an addiction is that after the mourning period there is often a sense of liberation triumph and accomplishment this differs from the slow sad acceptance and healing that follows a nonaddictive loss underlying all these reactions the essential similarity between addicts whether their addiction is to a substance or a person is a sense of incompleteness emptiness despair sadness and being lost that he believes he can remedy only through his connection to something or someone outside himself this something or someone becomes the center of his existence and he is willing to do himself a great deal of damage to keep his connection with it intact if we look back at eileens tie to peter we can see many of the signs of addiction she feels compelled to be in contact with him she panics when she thinks about ending it and has intense and agonizing withdrawal symptoms including physical disturbances from which she can only find immediate relief by reestablishing a connection with him and despite her considerable accomplishments and her many appealing qualities she has serious doubts about whether she is within herself a complete adequate and lovable person if she is without her connection to peter
