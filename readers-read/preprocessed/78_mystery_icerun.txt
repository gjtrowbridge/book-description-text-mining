 chapter one nbspnbspnbspnbsp in a land of hard winters the hardest of all is the winter that fills you with false hope its the kind of winter that starts out easy you get the white christmas but its a light snow six inches tops the stuff that makes everything look like a postcard the sun comes out during the day you can take your coat off if youre working hard enough the nights are quiet the stars shine between the silver clouds you celebrate new years you make resolutions it snows again and you run the plow you shovel you chop wood you sit inside at night by the fire you say to yourself this aint so bad a little cold weather is good for a man it makes you feel alive nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats what i was thinking i admit it although maybe i had other reasons to believe this winter would be easy maybe this winter i could be forgiven for letting my guard down one good look at the calendar would have put my head back on straight spring doesnt come until may alex which meant what winter had ten rounds left in a fifteenround fight that was plenty of time that was all the time in the world nbspnbspnbspnbsp when the storm finally hit i was down the road at the glasgow inn jackie had the fire going and had just made a big pot of his famous beef stew he had the cold molsons bought at the beer store across the bridge and stored just for me in his cooler for the simple reason that american beer cannot compare to beer bottled and sold in canada that and a red wings game on the television over the bar were all i needed on that night anyway i had plans for the next day i had big plans but for now i was happy just to be with jackie and to do everything i could to slowly drive him insane nbspnbspnbspnbsp alex youre gonna tell me whats going on he said for the third time he was an old scot god love him with the slightest hint of a burr in his speech born in glasgow sixtyodd years ago the son of a tugboat captain he came to michigan when he was a teenager he had been here ever since eventually opening up the glasgow inn it looked a lot more like a scottish pub than an american bar which meant you could spend the whole evening there without getting depressed or drunk or both nbspnbspnbspnbsp dont know what youre talking about i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp like hell you dont youve been bouncing in here saying hello and how are you smiling and laughing nbspnbspnbspnbsp im happy to see you i said is that so bad nbspnbspnbspnbsp since when are you happy about anything he gave me that popeye squint of his its january for gods sake nbspnbspnbspnbsp almost february i said how many inches have we had nbspnbspnbspnbsp dont even say that alex youll jinx it you know a storms coming nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had another cancellation today theres not enough snow to ride on this time of year snowmobiling was the biggest business in paradise michigan hell it was the only business every rental cabin in town and every motel room was booked months in advance on most january nights jackies place would be crawling with men from downstate most of them with their big puffy snowsuits zipped down to the waist nbspnbspnbspnbsp and that sound the whine of the engines coming from every direction it always drove me crazy but this night was silent nbspnbspnbspnbsp tonight he said well get buried you watch nbspnbspnbspnbsp i shrugged and looked up at the hockey game bring it on nbspnbspnbspnbsp and whats with the salad anyway nbspnbspnbspnbsp what salad nbspnbspnbspnbsp lettuce and vegetables alex that salad nbspnbspnbspnbsp what are you talking about nbspnbspnbspnbsp for dinner you had a salad nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had the stew jackie since when can i pass that up nbspnbspnbspnbsp you had a little bowl of stew and a big salad nbspnbspnbspnbsp okay so nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont eat salads for dinner ive never seen you eat a salad in fifteen years nbspnbspnbspnbsp so i felt like a salad jackie what are you getting at nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre not drinking as much beer either try to deny it nbspnbspnbspnbsp i held up my hands guilty you busted me nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre working out too i can tell nbspnbspnbspnbsp youve been bugging me for years to take better care of myself i said so now maybe i am is there something wrong with that nbspnbspnbspnbsp you finally decided to listen to me thats what youre telling me nbspnbspnbspnbsp is that so hard to believe nbspnbspnbspnbsp yes alex it is youve never listened to me not once nbspnbspnbspnbsp the door opened at that moment saving me from jackies third degree it was my friend and neighbor vinnie leblanc bringing in a blast of cold wet air nbspnbspnbspnbsp holy christ jackie said you can smell the snow coming it makes my bones hurt nbspnbspnbspnbsp whos winning vinnie said as he took off his coat it was a denim coat with a fur collar the only coat id ever seen him wear no matter how cold it got he was an ojibwa indian a member of the bay mills community he had moved off the reservation a few years ago and had bought the land down the road from mine and had built his own cabin we were friends for a while and then we werent then i helped him look for his brother what we found was a hell of a lot of trouble but somehow we also found our friendship again just like that without a word nbspnbspnbspnbsp wings i said two to one they just waved one off for colorado nbspnbspnbspnbsp he sat down next to me and asked jackie for a 7up the man never touched alcohol going on nine years straight nbspnbspnbspnbsp jackies right vinnie said its gonna snow you better not be too far away from home when it does nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats a good one jackie said since when does alex go anywhere nbspnbspnbspnbsp vinnie looked down at his glass he rattled the ice he had a smile on his face a smile so subtle you wouldnt even see it if you didnt know the man as well as i did nbspnbspnbspnbsp he knew he was the only one who knew my secret nbspnbspnbspnbsp i just couldnt tell jackie about it not yet i knew he had strong opinions about some things in life and this was one thing hed have a lot to say about maybe i wasnt ready to hear it yet or maybe i didnt want to ruin it maybe talking about it in the light of day would make it all vanish like a fever dream nbspnbspnbspnbsp for whatever reason i kept my mouth shut that night i was happy to sit by the fire and watch the rest of the hockey game the wings gave up a late goal and after the fiveminute overtime had to settle for a tie vinnie put his feet up and closed his eyes there was still white tape on the side of his face where the bullet had taken off part of his ear i knew he was spending a lot more time over at the reservation now looking after his mother i didnt see him nearly as much nbspnbspnbspnbsp we heard the wind picking up there was a soft ticking at the windows the snow had started outside this building not a hundred yards away lay the shoreline of lake superior the ice stretched out a quarter mile into the darkness of whitefish bay beyond that there was nothing but open water water so cold and deep it was like a cruel joke to call it a lake at all it was a sea the sea of superior and tonight it would feed the snow gods nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre gonna be plowing vinnie said he kept his eyes closed nbspnbspnbspnbsp im ready nbspnbspnbspnbsp he opened one eye he started to say something and stopped nbspnbspnbspnbsp what is it i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp he smiled again two smiles in one night nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre not going anywhere tomorrow he said youre gonna be stuck here nbspnbspnbspnbsp well see about that i said but i knew he was probably right god damn it nbspnbspnbspnbsp we finally left around midnight i said goodbye to jackie and he dismissed me with a wave of his hand nbspnbspnbspnbsp you got him a little worked up vinnie said as we stepped out into the night there were already three inches of new snow covering the parking lot he doesnt like not knowing whats going on nbspnbspnbspnbsp a little suspense is good for him i said it keeps him young nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp im going to my mothers house vinnie said ill see you tomorrow nbspnbspnbspnbsp ill plow your driveway drive carefully nbspnbspnbspnbsp we brushed our windshields off and then we were on our way vinnie to the reservation in brimley and me back up to the cabins if you ever come to paradise michigan you just go through the one blinking red light in the middle of town then north along the shore about a mile until you get to an old logging road hang that left and youll pass vinnies place first and then youll find my place my father bought the land back in the 1960s and built six cabins i live in the first cabin the one i helped him build myself back when i was an eighteenyearold hotshot on my way to singlea ball in sarasota at the time i never thought id be back up here for more than a visit i certainly wouldnt have imagined living up here not this place the loneliest place id ever seen but all these years later after all that had happened here i was nbspnbspnbspnbsp i put the plow down and pushed the new snow off as i went it felt as light as talcum powder i drove by vinnies place and then mine and kept going the second cabin was a quarter mile down the road there was a minivan parked in front with a trailer carrying two snowmobiles hitched behind it a family a man and his wife and two sons id given them the chance to cancel but theyd said theyd come up no matter what even with no snow they looked forward to the trip every year now it looked like they might get some riding in after all nbspnbspnbspnbsp another quarter mile and i got to the third cabin it was dark another quarter mile and then the fourth and fifth cabins together they were dark too nbspnbspnbspnbsp one more quarter mile the last cabin my father had built his masterpiece until somebody burned it down the walls were about half rebuilt now a great blue tarp covering the whole thing propped up in the middle to keep the snow off rising above it all was the chimney my father had built stone by stone nbspnbspnbspnbsp i stopped and got out of the truck made sure that the tarp was sealed tight the wind died down and the pine trees stopped swaying i took a long breath of the cold air and then got back in the truck i plowed my way back to my cabin nbspnbspnbspnbsp i went in and listened to the weather report on the radio more snow was coming a lot more they didnt even try to guess the number of inches thats always a bad sign nbspnbspnbspnbsp god damn it all i thought im going to canada tomorrow i dont care if we get three feet ill plow again in the morning and then im going nbspnbspnbspnbsp i went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror i ran a hand through my hair then picked up the package and read the directions one more time nbspnbspnbspnbsp i cant believe im doing this i said out loud nbspnbspnbspnbsp i looked in the mirror again then i put on the plastic gloves and went to work nbspnbspnbspnbsp the phone rang i took the gloves off and wiped my hands on the towel i picked it up on the third ring looking at the clock it was almost one oclock in the morning nbspnbspnbspnbsp alex she said with that voice it still hit me in the gut every time she was canadian so she had that little rise at the end of each sentence that singsong quality almost melodic but at the same time it was a voice that meant business it had some darkness in it a smokers voice without the smoke nbspnbspnbspnbsp hey its late i said are you all right nbspnbspnbspnbsp yes but i was just listening to the weather nbspnbspnbspnbsp a little snow no problem nbspnbspnbspnbsp a little snow eh theyre talking like twentyfour inches what are they saying down there nbspnbspnbspnbsp theyre not saying you never know with the lake it could be less than that or more nbspnbspnbspnbsp i dont think youre coming out here tomorrow nbspnbspnbspnbsp i thought about what to say there was a distant humming on the line i think i can still make it nbspnbspnbspnbsp dont be a dope she said youll kill yourself nbspnbspnbspnbsp out of a hundred different feelings i can have in one minute when im talking to her one feeling in particular came into focus now it was not the first time id felt it this little nagging doubt that maybe i wanted something out of all of this something real and that maybe she had woken up that morning not wanting anything at all nbspnbspnbspnbsp and then the thing that always came right after that the certain realization that i was being a complete ass nbspnbspnbspnbsp besides she said dont you have people staying in your cabins if its snowing all day dont you have to stick around to plow them out nbspnbspnbspnbsp ive got one family i said the rest of the cabins are empty nbspnbspnbspnbsp okay but even so that one family will need you around wont they nbspnbspnbspnbsp i closed my eyes and rubbed the bridge of my nose if theres a lot of snow falling yeah i cant be away for too long nbspnbspnbspnbsp so maybe its time to try out your idea nbspnbspnbspnbsp i opened my eyes whats that nbspnbspnbspnbsp you know about me coming to your place nbspnbspnbspnbsp here i looked around the cabin this was my idea to have her come here nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah why not ive got fourwheel drive and ive never even been there yet you always come out here im starting to feel guilty nbspnbspnbspnbsp one single bed the old couch sagging in the middle two rough wooden tables this sad wreck of a place after fifteen years of living all by myself this is what shed see my god nbspnbspnbspnbsp i dont know i said this cabin nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont want me to see your bachelor pad nbspnbspnbspnbsp im not sure id call it that nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah i dont think anyone says that anymore bachelor pad that was from the seventies right nbspnbspnbspnbsp the seventies i thought back when i was playing ball and being a cop and you were god were you in grade school then nbspnbspnbspnbsp alex are you still there nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah yeah im just thinking i dont want you driving all this way tomorrow if the weathers gonna be bad nbspnbspnbspnbsp it was just an idea okay nbspnbspnbspnbsp think alex think nbspnbspnbspnbsp hey i know i said why dont we do something special nbspnbspnbspnbsp special like what nbspnbspnbspnbsp like ill meet you somewhere nbspnbspnbspnbsp i thought you had to stay there nbspnbspnbspnbsp we could meet in the soo i said thatll keep me close enough to home nbspnbspnbspnbsp soo michigan nbspnbspnbspnbsp theres a great hotel right on the river nbspnbspnbspnbsp a hotel nbspnbspnbspnbsp its called the ojibway i said you ever been there nbspnbspnbspnbsp no she said never nbspnbspnbspnbsp theyve got great food and its just i mean its been there forever its the only fancy place in town nbspnbspnbspnbsp you want us to stay there nbspnbspnbspnbsp im just saying youre blowing it alex its all gonna fall apart right here nbspnbspnbspnbsp this is a nice place in soo michigan nbspnbspnbspnbsp a little jab there i thought sault ste marie michigan is so much smaller than its sister city across the river soo canada has more of everything nbspnbspnbspnbsp its a classy hotel i said id really like to see you okay its been a few days and i wouldnt mind spending some time with you nbspnbspnbspnbsp she didnt say anything for a long moment there was the faint hum on the line and nothing else nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah why not she said it sounds nice nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats how it happened that hesitation that long silence while she thought about it i figured that was just natural just part of the dance the getting to know someone new nbspnbspnbspnbsp of course it wasnt that at all it was something else entirely but i didnt know her well enough yet i didnt know the way she was the way she has been for most of her life the way she had to be above all i didnt know the one most important thing about her that she never ever hesitated that long about anything not unless it was something big nbspnbspnbspnbsp really big nbspnbspnbspnbsp damn it all to hell if i had only known
