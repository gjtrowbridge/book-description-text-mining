 my name is bruno salvador my friends call me salvo so do my enemies contrary to what anybody may tell you i am a citizen in good standing of the united kingdom and northern ireland and by profession a top interpreter of swahili and the lesserknown but widely spoken languages of the eastern congo formerly under belgian rule hence my mastery of french a further arrow in my professional quiver i am a familiar face around the london law courts both civil and criminal and in regular demand at conferences on third world matters see my glowing references from many of our nation8217s finest corporate names due to my special skills i have also been called upon to do my patriotic duty on a confidential basis by a government department whose existence is routinely denied i have never been in trouble i pay my taxes regularly have a healthy credit rating and am the owner of a wellconducted bank account those are castiron facts that no amount of bureaucratic manipulation can alter however hard they try in six years of honest labour in the world of commerce i have applied my services 8212 be it by way of cautiously phrased conference calls or discreet meetings in neutral cities on the european continent 8212 to the creative adjustment of oil gold diamond mineral and other commodity prices not to mention the diversion of many millions of dollars from the prying eyes of the world8217s shareholders into slush funds as far removed as panama budapest and singapore ask me whether in facilitating these transactions i felt obliged to consult my conscience and you will receive the emphatic answer 8216no8217 the code of your top interpreter is sacrosanct he is not hired to indulge his scruples he is pledged to his employer in the same manner as a soldier is pledged to the flag in deference to the world8217s unfortunates however it is also my practice to make myself available on a pro bono basis to london hospitals prisons and the immigration authorities despite the fact that the remuneration in such cases is peanuts i am on the voters8217 list at number 17 norfolk mansions prince of wales drive battersea south london a desirable freehold property of which i am the minority coowner together with my legal wife penelope 8212 never call her penny 8212 an upperechelon oxbridge journalist four years my senior and at the age of thirtytwo a rising star in the firmament of a massmarket british tabloid capable of swaying millions penelope8217s father is the senior partner of a bluechip city law firm and her mother a major force in her local conservative party we married five years ago on the strength of a mutual physical attraction plus the understanding that she would get pregnant as soon as her career permitted owing to my desire to create a stable nuclear family complete with mother along conventional british lines the convenient moment has not however presented itself due to her rapid rise within the paper and other factors our union was not in all regards orthodox penelope was the elder daughter of an allwhite surrey family in high professional standing while bruno salvador alias salvo was the natural son of a bog irish roman catholic missionary and a congolese village woman whose name has vanished for ever in the ravages of war and time i was born to be precise behind the locked doors of a carmelite convent in the town of kisangani or stanleyville as was being delivered by nuns who had vowed to keep their mouths shut which to anybody but me sounds funny surreal or plain invented but to me it8217s a biological reality as it would be for you if at the age of ten you had sat at your saintly father8217s bedside in a mission house in the lush green highlands of south kivu in the eastern congo listening to him sobbing his heart out half in norman french and half in ulsterman8217s english with the equatorial rain pounding like elephant feet on the green tin roof and the tears pouring down his feverhollowed cheeks so fast you8217d think the whole of nature had come indoors to join the fun ask a westerner where kivu is he will shake his head in ignorance and smile ask an african and he will tell you 8216paradise8217 for such it is a central african land of misted lakes and volcanic mountains emerald pastureland luscious fruit groves and similar in his seventieth and last year of life my father8217s principal worry was whether he had enslaved more souls than he had liberated the vatican8217s african missionaries according to him were caught in a perpetual cleft stick between what they owed to life and what they owed to rome and i was part of what he owed to life however much his spiritual brothers might resent me we buried him in the swahili language which was what he8217d asked for but when it fell to me to read 8216the lord is my shepherd8217 at his graveside i gave him my very own rendering in shi his favourite among all the languages of the eastern congo for its vigour and flexibility illegitimate sonsinlaw of mixed race do not merge naturally into the social fabric of wealthy surrey and penelope8217s parents were no exception to this timehonoured truism in a favourable light i used to tell myself when i was growing up i look more suntanned irish than midbrown afro plus my hair is straight not crinkly which goes a long way if you8217re assimilating but that never fooled penelope8217s mother or her fellow wives at the golf club her worst nightmare being that her daughter would produce an allblack grandchild on her watch which may have accounted for penelope8217s reluctance to put matters to the test although in retrospect i am not totally convinced of this part of her motive in marrying me being to shock her mother and upstage her younger sister a word here regarding my dear late father8217s life struggle will not be deemed out of place his entry into the world he confided to me had been no smoother than my own born in 1917 to a corporal in the royal ulster fusiliers and a fourteenyearold normandy peasant girl who happened to be passing at the time he spent his childhood on the shunt between a hovel in the sperrin mountains and another in northern france until by dint of study plus his inherited bilinguality he clawed himself a place in a junior seminary in the wilds of county donegal and thus set his young feet unthinkingly on the path to god sent to france for the greater refinement of his faith he endured without complaint interminable years of gruelling instruction in catholic theology but as soon as the second world war broke out he grabbed the nearest bicycle which with irish wit he assured me was the property of a godless protestant and pedalled hell for leather across the pyrenees to lisbon stowing away on a tramper bound for leopoldville as was he evaded the attentions of a colonial government ill disposed towards stray white missionaries and attached himself to a remote community of friars dedicated to bringing the one true faith to the two hundredodd tribes of the eastern congo an ambitious commitment at any time those who now and then have accused me of impulsiveness need look no further than my dear late father on his heretic8217s pushbike aided by native converts whose tongues the natural linguist swiftly made his own he baked bricks and limed them with red mud trodden by his own feet dug ditches in the hillside and installed latrines amid the banana groves next came the building first the church then the school with its twin bell tower then the mother mary clinic then the fishponds and fruit and vegetable plantations to supply them such being his true vocation as a peasant in a region lavishly endowed with nature8217s riches whether you are talking cassava papaya maize soya beans quinine or kivu8217s wild strawberries which are the best in the world bar none after all this came the mission house itself and behind the mission house a low brick hostel with small windows high up for mission servants in god8217s name he trekked hundreds of kilometres to remote patelins and mining settlements never failing when opportunity arose to add another language to his evergrowing collection until a day when he returned to his mission to find his fellow priests fled the cows goats and chickens stolen the school and mission house razed the hospital pillaged its nurses hamstrung raped and slaughtered and himself a prisoner of the last ragtag elements of the fearsome simba a murderous rabble of misguided revolutionists whose sole aim until their official extinction a few years previously had been to visit death and mayhem on all perceived agents of colonisation which could be anyone nominated by themselves or by the guiding spirits of their longdeceased warrior ancestors as a general principle it is true the simba stopped short of harming white priests fearing that by doing so they would break the dawa that rendered themselves immune to flying bullets in the case of my dear late father however his captors were quick to set aside their reservations arguing that since he spoke their language as well as they did he was plainly a black devil in disguise of his fortitude in captivity many inspiring anecdotes were later told whipped repeatedly in order to expose the true colour of his devil8217s skin tortured and forced to witness the torturing of others he proclaimed the gospel and begged god8217s forgiveness for his tormentors whenever able he went among his fellow prisoners administering the sacrament yet not the holy church in all its wisdom could have been prepared for the cumulative effect on him of these privations mortification of the flesh we are taught furthers the triumph of the spirit such however was not the case for my dear late father who within months of his release had demonstrated the flaw in this convenient theory and not merely with my dear late mother if there is divine purpose to your conception son he confided to me on his deathbed resorting to his lovely irish brogue lest his fellow priests should overhear him through the floorboards it is to be found in that stinking prison hut and at the whipping post the thought that i might die without knowing the consolation of a woman8217s body was the one torture i could not bear her reward for producing me was as cruel as it was unjust at my father8217s urging she set off for her home village with the intention of giving birth to me among her clan and tribe but these were turbulent times for the congo or as general mobutu insisted it be known zaire in the name of authenticity foreign priests had been expelled for the crime of baptising babies with western names schools had been forbidden to teach the life of jesus and christmas declared a normal working day it was therefore not surprising that the elders of my mother8217s village baulked at the prospect of nurturing a white missionary8217s lovechild whose presence among them could invite instant retribution and accordingly sent the problem back to where it came from but the mission fathers were as reluctant as the village elders to receive us referring my mother instead to a distant convent where she arrived with only hours to spare before my birth three months of tough love at the hands of the carmelites were more than enough for her reasoning that they were better placed than she to provide me with a future she consigned me to their mercy and escaping at dead of night by way of the bathhouse roof crept back to her kin and family who weeks afterwards were massacred in their entirety by an aberrant tribe right down to my last grandparent uncle cousin distant aunt and halfbrother or sister a village headman8217s daughter son my father whispered through his tears when i pressed him for details that might assist me in forming a mental picture of her to sustain me in my later years i had taken shelter under his roof she cooked our food and brought me the water to wash with it was the generosity of her that overwhelmed me he had eschewed the pulpit by then and had no appetite for verbal pyrotechnics nevertheless the memory rekindled the irishman8217s smouldering rhetorical fires as tall as you8217ll be one day son as beautiful as all creation how in god8217s name can they tell me you were born in sin you were born in love my son there is no sin but hate the retribution meted out to my father by the holy church was less draconian than my mother8217s but severe one year in a jesuit rehab penitentiary outside madrid two more as a workerpriest in a marseilles slum and only then back to the congo he so unwisely loved and how he swung it i don8217t know and probably god doesn8217t either but somewhere along his stony path he persuaded the catholic orphanage that had custody of me to give me up to him thereafter the halfcaste bastard who was salvo trailed after him in the care of servants chosen for their age and ugliness first in the guise of offspring of a deceased uncle later as acolyte and server until that fateful night of my tenth birthday when conscious as much of his mortality as my ripening he poured out his very human heart to me as described above which i regarded and still do as the greatest compliment a father can pay to his accidental son the years following my dear late father8217s death did not pass smoothly for the orphaned salvo owing to the fact that the white missionaries viewed my continued presence among them as a festering affront hence my swahili nickname of mtoto wa siri or secret child africans maintain that we derive our spirit from our father and our blood from our mother and that was my problem in a nutshell had my dear late father been black i might have been tolerated as excess baggage but he was white through and through whatever the simba might have thought and irish with it and white missionaries it is well known do not engender babies on the side the secret child might serve at priests8217 table and the altar and attend their schools but come the approach of an ecclesiastical dignitary of whatever colour he was whisked to the mission workers8217 hostel to be hidden until the threat blew over which is neither to disparage the brethren for their highmindedness nor to blame them for the occasionally excessive warmth of their regard unlike my dear late father they had restricted themselves to their own gender when addressing their carnality as witness pegravere andreacute our great mission orator who lavished more attention on me than i could comfortably accommodate or pegravere franccedilois who liked to think of andreacute as his chosen friend and took umbrage at this flowering of affection in our mission school meanwhile i enjoyed neither the deference shown to our smattering of white children nor the comradeship owed me by my native peers little wonder then if i gravitated naturally towards the mission servants8217 low brick hostel which unbeknown to the fathers was the true hub of our community the natural sanctuary for any passing traveller and the trading point of oral information for miles around and it was there curled up unnoticed on a wood pallet beside the brick chimneybreast that i listened spellbound to the tales of itinerant huntsmen witch doctors spellsellers warriors and elders scarcely venturing a word of my own for fear of being packed off to bed it was there also that my evergrowing love of the eastern congo8217s many languages and dialects took root hoarding them as my dear late father8217s precious legacy i covertly polished and refined them storing them in my head as protection from i knew not what perils pestering native and missionary alike for a nugget of vernacular or turn of phrase in the privacy of my tiny cell i composed my own childish dictionaries by candlelight soon these magic puzzlepieces became my identity and refuge the private sphere that nobody could take away from me and only the few enter and i have often wondered as i wonder now what course the secret child8217s life might have taken had i been permitted to continue along this solitary and ambivalent path and whether the pull of my mother8217s blood might have turned out to be stronger than my father8217s spirit the question remains academic however since my dear late father8217s former brethren were energetically conspiring to be rid of me my accusing skin colour my versatility in languages my cocky irish manner and worst of all the good looks that according to the mission servants i owed to my mother were a daily reminder of his erring ways after much intrigue it transpired against all likelihood that my birth had been registered with the british consul in kampala according to whom brunoothernamesunknown was a foundling adopted by the holy see his purported father a northern irish seafarer had thrust the newborn child into the arms of the carmelite mother superior with the entreaty that i be fostered in the true faith he had thereupon vanished without leaving a forwarding address or so ran the implausible handwritten account of the good consul who was himself a loyal son of rome the surname salvador he explained had been selected by the mother superior herself she being of spanish origin but why quibble i was an official dot on the world population map ever thankful to the long left arm of rome for coming to my aid directed by the same long arm to my nonnative england i was placed under the protection of the sanctuary of the sacred heart an eternal boarding school for ambiguous catholic orphans of the male gender set among the rolling sussex downs my arrival within its prisonlike gates one arctic afternoon in late november awoke a spirit of rebellion in me for which neither i nor my hosts were prepared in the space of a few weeks i had set fire to my bedsheets defaced my latin primer absented myself from mass without permission and been caught attempting to escape in the back of a laundry van if the simba had whipped my dear late father in order to prove that he was black the father guardian8217s energies were directed to proving i was white as an irishman himself he felt particularly challenged savages he thundered at me as he toiled are by nature rash they have no middle gear the middle gear of any man is selfdiscipline and by beating me and praying for me while he was about it he hoped to make up for my deficiency unknown to him however rescue was at hand in the person of a grizzled but energetic friar who had turned his back on birth and wealth brother michael my new protector and appointed confessor was a scion of the english catholic gentry his lifelong wanderings had taken him to the remotest ends of the earth once i had grown accustomed to his fondlings we became close friends and allies and the father guardian8217s attentions commensurately declined though whether this was a consequence of my reformed behaviour or as i now suspect some pact between them i neither knew nor cared in a single bracing afternoon8217s walk across the rainswept downs interrupted by demonstrations of affection brother michael convinced me that my mixed race far from being a taint to be expunged was god8217s precious gift to me a view in which i gratefully concurred best of all he loved my ability which i was bold enough to demonstrate to him to glide without hiatus from one language to another at the mission house i had paid dearly for showing off my talents but under brother michael8217s doting eye they acquired nearheavenly status 8216what greater blessing my dear salvo8217 he cried while a wiry fist shot out of his habit to punch the air and the other foraged guiltily among my clothing 8216than to be the bridge the indispensable link between god8217s striving souls to draw his children together in harmonious and mutual understanding8217 what michael didn8217t already know of my life history i soon recounted to him in the course of our excursions i told him of my magic nights at the fireside of the servants8217 hostel i described how in my father8217s last years he and i would journey to an outlying village and while he was conferring with the elders i would be down on the river bank with the children bartering the words and idioms that were my dayandnight preoccupation others might look to rough games wild animals plants or native dance as their path to happiness but salvo the secret child had opted for the lilting intimacies of the african voice in its myriad shades and variations and it was while i was recalling these and similar adventures that brother michael was granted his damascene epiphany 8216as the lord hath been pleased to sow in you salvo so let us now together reap 8217 he cried and reap we did deploying skills better suited to a military commander than a monk the aristocratic michael studied prospectuses compared fees marched me to interviews vetted my prospective tutors male or female and stood over me while i enrolled myself his purposes inflamed by adoration were as implacable as his faith i was to receive formal grounding in each and every one of my languages i was to rediscover those that in the course of my roving childhood had fallen by the wayside how was all this to be paid for by a certain angel delivered to us in the form of michael8217s rich sister imelda whose pillared house of honeygolden sandstone nestling in the folds of middle somerset became my sanctuary away from the sanctuary in willowbrook where rescued pitponies grazed in the paddock and each dog had its own armchair there lived three hearty sisters of whom imelda was the eldest we had a private chapel and an angelus bell a haha and an icehouse and a croquet lawn and weeping lime trees that blew down in gales we had uncle henry8217s room because aunt imelda was the widow of a war hero named henry who singlehanded had made england safe for us and there he was from his first teddybear lying on his pillow to his last letter from the front in a goldcased lectern but no photograph thank you aunt imelda who was as tart in manner as she was soft in heart remembered henry perfectly well without and that way she kept him to herself but brother michael knew my weak spots too he knew that child prodigies 8212 for as such he saw me 8212 must be restrained as well as nurtured he knew i was diligent but headlong too eager to give myself to anyone who was kind to me too fearful of being rejected ignored or worst of all laughed at too swift to embrace whatever was offered me for fear i wouldn8217t get another chance he treasured as much as i did my mynahbird ear and jackdaw memory but insisted i practise them as diligently as a musician his instrument or a priest his faith he knew that every language was precious to me not only the heavyweights but the little ones that were condemned to die for want of written form that the missionary8217s son needed to run after these erring sheep and lead them back to the fold that i heard legend history fable and poetry in them and the voice of my imagined mother regaling me with spirittales he knew that a young man who has his ears open to every human nuance and inflexion is the most suggestible the most malleable the most innocent and easily misled salvo he would say take care there are people out there whom god alone can love it was michael also who by forcing me down the hard road of discipline turned my unusual talents into a versatile machine nothing of his salvo should go to waste he insisted nothing be allowed to rust for want of use every muscle and fibre of my divine gift must receive its daily workout in the gymnasium of the mind first by way of private tutors afterwards at the school of oriental and african studies in london where i obtained first class honours in african language and culture specialising in swahili with french a given and finally in edinburgh where i achieved the crowning glory a master of science degree in translation and public service interpreting thus by the close of my studies i boasted more diplomas and interpreterships than half the flyblown translation agencies hawking their grubby services up and down chancery lane and brother michael dying on his iron cot was able to stroke my hands and assure me that i was his finest creation in recognition of which he pressed upon me a gold wristwatch a present to him from imelda whom god preserve entreating me to keep it wound at all times as a symbol of our bond beyond the grave never mistake please your mere translator for your top interpreter an interpreter is a translator true but not the other way round a translator can be anyone with half a language skill and a dictionary and a desk to sit at while he burns the midnight oil pensionedoff polish cavalry officers underpaid overseas students minicab drivers parttime waiters and supply teachers and anyone else who is prepared to sell his soul for seventy quid a thousand he has nothing in common with the simultaneous interpreter sweating it out through six hours of complex negotiations your top interpreter has to think as fast as a numbers boy in a coloured jacket buying financial futures better sometimes if he doesn8217t think at all but orders the spinning cogs on both sides of his head to mesh together then sits back and waits to see what pours out of his mouth people come up to me sometimes during conferences usually at the teasy end of the day between close of business and the cocktail frenzy 8216hey salvo settle an argument for us will you what8217s your mother tongue8217 and if i consider they8217re being a bit uppity which they usually are because they have by now convinced themselves they8217re the most important people on the planet i8217ll turn the question round on them 8216depends who my mother was doesn8217t it8217 i reply with this enigmatic smile i8217ve got and after that they leave me with my book but i like them to wonder it shows me that i8217ve got my voice right my english voice i mean it isn8217t upper middle or coach it isn8217t faux royale neither is it the received pronunciation derided by the british left it is if anything at all aggressively neuter pitched at the extreme centre of anglophone society it8217s not the sort of english where people say 8216ah that8217s where he was dragged up that8217s who he8217s trying to be that8217s who his parents were poor chap and that8217s where he went to school8217 it does not 8212 unlike my french which strive as i may will never totally rid itself of its african burden 8212 betray my mixed origins it8217s not regional it8217s not your blairite wannabeclassless slur or your hightory curdled cockney or your caribbean melody and it hasn8217t so much as a trace of the goneaway vowels of my dear late father8217s irish brogue i loved his voice and love it still but it was his and never mine no my spoken english is blank scrubbed clean and unbranded except for an occasional beauty spot a deliberate subsaharan lilt which i refer to sportingly as my drop of milk in the coffee i like it clients like it it gives them the feeling i8217m comfortable with myself i8217m not in their camp but i8217m not in the other fellow8217s either i8217m stuck out there in midocean and being what brother michael always said i should be the bridge the indispensable link between god8217s striving souls each man has his vanity and mine is about being the one person in the room nobody can do without and that8217s the person i wanted to be for my ravishing wife penelope as i half killed myself racing up two flights of stone steps in my desperate effort not to be late for the festivities being held in her honour in the upstairs rooms of a fashionable winery in london8217s canary wharf capital of our great british newspaper industry prior to a formal dinner for the selected few at the exclusive kensington home of her paper8217s newest billionaire proprietor only twelve minutes late by aunt imelda8217s gold watch you may say and to all outward appearances salon fresh which in bombscared london with half the tube stations on the blink might be regarded as an achievement but to salvo the hyperconscientious husband it could as well have been twelve hours penelope8217s big night the biggest of her meteoric career to date and me her husband rolling up after all the guests have walked over from her paper8217s offices across the road from the north london district hospital where i had been unavoidably detained since the previous evening by circumstances outside my control i had splashed out on a cab all the way home to battersea and made it wait while i quickchanged into my brandnew dinner jacket this being de rigueur at the proprietor8217s table with no chance to shave or shower or brush my teeth by the time i arrived at the due destination and in the appropriate costume i was in a muck sweat but somehow i had made it and here i was and here they were a hundred or more of penelope8217s assorted colleagues the upper few in dinner jackets and long dresses the rest smartcasual and all of them crowded into a firstfloor function room with low beams and plastic suits of armour on the wall drinking warm white wine with their elbows out and me the latecomer stuck at the edge with the waiters mostly black i couldn8217t see her to begin with i thought she8217d gone awol like her husband then i had a moment hoping she8217d decided to stage a late entry until i spotted her squashed up at the far end of the room engaged in animated conversation with her paper8217s top brass and wearing the latest thing in flowing satin trousersuits that she must have bought herself as a present and changed into at her office or wherever she8217d last been why oh why 8212 cried one side of my head 8212 had i not bought it for her why hadn8217t i said to her a week ago over breakfast or in bed assuming she was there to say it to penelope my darling i8217ve had this great idea let8217s go to knightsbridge together and choose ourselves a new outfit for your big night all on me shopping is what she likes best i could have made an occasion of it played her gentleman admirer dined her at one of her favourite restaurants never mind she8217s earning twice the money i am plus perks you wouldn8217t believe on the other hand for reasons to be addressed in a more reposeful moment there was another side of my head that was very pleased i hadn8217t made any such proposal which has nothing to do with the money but says much for the contrary currents of the human mind under stress an unknown hand pinched my bottom i swung round to meet the beatific gaze of jellicoe alias jelly the paper8217s latest young white hope recently poached from a rival newspaper lank drunk and whimsical as usual he was tendering a handrolled cigarette between his slender finger and thumb 8216penelope it8217s me i made it8217 i yelled ignoring him 8216tough time at the hospital terribly sorry8217 sorry for what for the tough time a couple of heads turned oh him salvo penelope8217s spearman i tried louder deploying wit 8216hey penelope remember me it8217s me your late husband8217 and i got myself all geared up to launch into an overelaborate cover story about how one of my hospitals 8212 i would not for security reasons have mentioned which 8212 had summoned me to the bedside of a dying rwandan man with a criminal history who kept going in and out of consciousness requiring me to interpret not only for the nursing staff but for two scotland yard detectives as well which i hoped was a predicament she would take to heart poor salvo i saw a creamy smile come over her face and i thought i8217d got through to her till i realised it was beamed upwards at the thicknecked male who was standing on a chair in his dinner jacket shouting 8216 quiet damn you will you shut the fuck up all of you 8217 in a scottish brogue at once his unruly audience fell silent gathering to him with sheepish obedience for this was none other than penelope8217s allpowerful editorinchief fergus thorne known in press circles as thorne the horn announcing that he proposed to make a facetious speech about my wife i hopped about i did my utmost to make eye contact with her but the face from which i craved absolution was lifted to her boss like a flower to the sun8217s lifegiving rays 8216now we all know penelope8217 thorne the horn was saying to jeers of sycophantic laughter which annoyed me 8216and we all love penelope8217 8212 a significant pause 8212 8216from our respective positions8217 i was trying to squeeze my way through to her but the ranks had closed and penelope was being handed forward like the blushing bride till she was stationed obediently at mr thorne8217s feet incidentally providing him with a bird8217seye view down the front of her highly revealing outfit and it was beginning to enter my mind that she might not have registered my absence let alone my presence when my attention was diverted by what i diagnosed as god8217s judgment upon me in the form of a force twelve heart attack my chest was trembling i could feel a numbness spreading in rhythmic waves from my left nipple and i thought my time had come and serve me right it was only when i clapped my hand to the afflicted area that i realised that my cellphone was summoning me in its unfamiliar vibrator mode which was how i had set it prior to departure from the hospital one hour and thirtyfive minutes previously my exclusion from the throng now turned to my advantage while mr thorne developed his doubleedged remarks about my wife i was able to tiptoe gratefully towards a door marked toilets making good my exit i glanced back one more time to see penelope8217s newly coiffed head lifted to her employer her lips parted in pleasurable surprise and her breasts on full parade inside the skimpy upper section of her trousersuit i let my phone go on trembling till i was down three steps into a quiet corridor pressed green and held my breath but instead of the voice i feared and longed to hear above all others i got the avuncular north country burr of mr anderson of the ministry of defence wanting to know whether i was free to take on a bit of rather vital interpreting for my country at short notice which he sincerely hoped i was that mr anderson should be calling a mere parttimer such as myself in person indicated the magnitude of the crisis at hand my normal contact was barney his flamboyant floor manager twice in the last ten days barney had put me on standby for what he called a hot one only to tell me i could stand down again 8216 now mr anderson8217 8216this minute preferably sooner if that8217s convenient sorry to break up your drinks party and all that but we need you fast8217 he continued and i suppose i should have been surprised that he knew about penelope8217s party but i wasn8217t mr anderson was a man who made it his business to know things denied to humbler mortals 8216it8217s your home territory salvo your heartland8217 8216but mr anderson8217 8216what is it son8217 8216it isn8217t just her drinks party there8217s the new proprietor8217s dinner afterwards black tie8217 i added to impress 8216it8217s unprecedented for a proprietor i mean editorinchief yes but proprietor 8217 call it guilt call it sentiment i owed it to penelope to put up a show of resistance a silence followed as if i had caught him on the back foot but nobody does that to mr anderson he8217s the rock on which his own church is built 8216is that what you8217re wearing is it son a dinner jacket8217 8216it is indeed mr anderson8217 8216now as we speak you8217ve got it on8217 8216yes8217 what did he suppose that i was attending a bacchanalia 8216how long8217s it for anyway8217 i asked in the ensuing silence made deeper i suspected by the fact that he had put his massive hand over the mouthpiece 8216how long8217s what son8217 8212 as if he8217d lost the thread 8216the assignment sir the urgent job you need me
