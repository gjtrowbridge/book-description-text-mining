 chapter excerpt chapter one something in the snow silas heap pulled his cloak tightly around him against the snow it had been a long walk through the forest and he was chilled to the bone but in his pockets he had the herbs that galen the physik woman had given him for his new baby boy septimus who had been born earlier that day silas drew closer to the castle and he could see the lights flickering through the trees as candles were placed in the windows of the tall narrow houses clustered along the outside walls it was the longest night of the year and the candles would be kept burning until dawn to help keep the dark at bay silas always loved this walk to the castle he had no fear of the forest by day and enjoyed the peaceful walk along the narrow track that threaded its way through the dense trees for mile after mile he was near the edge of the forest now the tall trees had begun to thin out and as the track began to dip down to the valley floor silas could see the whole castle spread before him the old walls hugged the wide winding river and zigzagged around the higgledypiggledy clumps of houses all the houses were painted bright colors and those that faced west looked as if they were on fire as their windows caught the last of the winter suns rays the castle had started life as a small village being so near to the forest the villagers had put up some tall stone walls for protection against the wolverines witches and warlocks who thought nothing of stealing their sheep chickens and occasionally their children as more houses were built the walls were extended and a deep moat was dug so that all could feel safe soon the castle was attracting skilled craftsmen from other villages it grew and prospered so much so that the inhabitants began to run out of space until someone decided to build the ramblings the ramblings which was where silas sarah and the boys lived was a huge stone building that rose up along the riverside i t sprawled for three miles along the river and back again into the caste and was a noisy busy place filled with a warren of passages and rooms with small factories schools and shops mixed in with family rooms tiny roof garens and even a theater there was not much space in the ramblings but people did not mind there was always good company and someone for the children to play with as the winter sun sank below the castle walls silas quickened his pace he needed to get to the north gate before they locked it an pulled up the drawbridge at nightfall it was then that silas sensed something nearby something alive but only just he was aware of a small human heartbeat somewhere close to him silas stopped as an ordinary wizard he was able to sense things but as he was not a particularly good ordinary wizard he needed to concentrate hard he stood still with the snow falling fast around him already covering his footprints and then he heard something151a snuffle a whimper a small breath he wasnt sure but it was enough underneath a bush beside the path was a bundle silas picked up the bundle and to his amazement found himself gazing into the solemn eyes of a tiny baby silas cradled the baby in his arms and wondered how she had come to be lying in the snow on the coldest day of the year someone had wrapped her tightly in a heavy woolen blanket but she was already very cold her lips were a dusky blue and the snow dusted her eyelashes as the babys dark violet eyes gazed intently at him silas had the uncomfortable feeling that she had already seen things in her short life that no baby should see thinking of his sarah at home warm and safe with septimus and the boys silas decided that they would just have to make room for one more little one he carefully tucked the baby into his blue wizard cloak and held her close to him as he ran toward the castle gate he reached the drawbridge just as gringe the gatekeeper was about to go and yell for the bridge boy to start winding it up youre cutting it a bit fine growled gringe but you wizards are weird waddyou all want to be out for on a day like this i dunno oh silas wanted to get past gringe as soon as he could but first he had to cross gringes palm with silver silas quickly found a silver penny in one of his pockets and handed it over thank you gringe good night gringe looked at the the penny as though it were a rather nasty beetle marcia overstrand she gave me a 145alf crown just now but then shes got class what with 145er being the extraordinary wizard now what silas nearly choked yeah class thats what shes got gringe stood back to let him pass and silas slipped by as much as silas wanted to find out why marcia overstrand was suddenly the extraordinary wizard he could feel the bundle beginning to stir in the warmth of his cloak and something told him that it would be better if gringe did not know about the baby as silas disappeared into the shadows of the tunnel that led to the ramblings a tall figure in purple stepped out and barred his way marcia gasped silas what on earth151 tell no one you found her she was born to you understand shocked silas nodded before he had time to say anything marcia was gone in a shimmer of purple mist silas spent the rest of the long winding journey through the ramblings with his mind in turmoil who was this baby what did marcia have to do with her and why was marcia the extraordinary wizard now and as a silas neared the big red door that led to the heap familys already overcrowded room another more pressing question came into his mind what was sarah going to say to yet another baby to care for silas did not have long to think about the last question as he reached the door it flew open and a large redfaced woman wearing the dark blue robes of a matron midwife ran out almost knocking silas over as she fled she too was carrying a bundle but the bundle was wrapped from head to toe in bandages and she was carrying him under her arm as if he were a parcel and she was late for the post dead cried the matron midwife she pushed silas aside with a powerful shove and ran down the corridor inside the room sarah heap screamed silas went in with a heavy heart he saw sarah surrounded by six whitefaced little boys all too scared to cry shes taken him said sarah hopelessly septimus is dead and shes taken him away at that moment a warm wetness spread out from the bundle that silas still had hidden under his cloak silas had no words for what he wanted to say so he just took the bundle out from under his cloak and placed her in sarahs arms sarah heap burst into tears
