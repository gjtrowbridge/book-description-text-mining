 it had been a long day for the dalai lama even by the time he had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 730 am he had already been up for four hours completing his rigorous daily regimen of prayer study and meditation after breakfast he began his usual workday and that day there was a full lineup meeting with one person after another he saw an indian government liaison officer the head lama of one of the ancient lineages of tibetan buddhism the president of a member republic of the russian federation a high official in the tibetan governmentinexile and various members of his private office staff and scheduled among these private meetings i watched with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived tibetan refugees they had made the arduous journey across the himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus but more likely to have caught a lift riding in the open bed of a shuddering pickup truck some had crossed the rugged border on foot climbing highaltitude passes with grim determination here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toecasualties of frostbite many arrived penniless destitute their traditional chubas native tibetan costumes tattered and dusty from the long journey in some of the older faces ruddy faces weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate one could detect traces of untold suffering spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the chinese communists for many of these people however a mere glimpse of the dalai lama the fulfillment of a lifelong dream was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy he offered them all young and old words of hope and encouragement as well as hardheaded practical advice ranging from education is critical to success to now you men should be careful of going with prostitutesyou could catch a disease finally it was 2 pm his last scheduled appointment for the day and here was i i had been allotted several hours each afternoon to collaborate on our book and i was here to collect our meetings were far from chatty tiacuteteyacutetiacutetes however in fact i often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile east and west pestering him with endless questions a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to answer that it had become a running joke between us trying even his legendary patience standing outside on his bougainvilleadraped porch with the majestic snowcapped dhauladhar mountains of northern india as a backdrop the dalai lama greeted me warmly as he led me inside his home little had changed in this room since our first meeting twenty years before the same traditional tibetan thanka paintings lined the pale yellow walls the same buddhist shrine covered with ornate buddhist icons at one end of the room and the same floortoceiling relief map of tibet dominating the opposite wall even the modest furniture appeared to be the same although its possible the sofa may have been reupholstered as i unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day the dalai lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day so as i loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin i often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him on that day in particular i was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth thinking about this as i began our session i said you know i couldnt help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you people with various professions all sorts of jobs and i was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities now this week i want to focus on the topic of work yes good the dalai lama nodded and since were going to be talking about work this week i was just curious what do you consider to be your primary job the dalai lama looked puzzled what do you mean i was puzzled why he was puzzled it seemed to be a simple question well in the west i explained when you meet somebody often the first question you ask a stranger is what do you do meaning specifically what kind of work do you do whats your job so if you met a complete stranger and they didnt know you or had never heard of the dalai lama and they didnt even know what your monks robes signified they just met you as a human being and they asked you what do you do for a living what would you tell them the dalai lama reflected in silence for a long while and finally declared nothing i do nothing nothing in response to my blank stare he repeated himself if i was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer nothing nothing i didnt buy it he clearly worked as hard as anyone i knew harder even and as grueling as this day had been it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad in fact informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the us the year before i had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity dedication and hard work as a statesman he had met with president george w bush secretary of state colin powell and a host of highranking senators and members of congress as a teacher an ordained buddhist monk and consummate buddhist scholar he gave extensive lectures expounding the most subtle facets of buddhist philosophy as a nobel peace prize laureate and tireless advocate for world peace and human rights he gave public addresses to tens of thousands hundreds of thousands as a religious leader striving to promote interfaith dialogue and harmony he met with religious figures from many faiths priests rabbis ministers and swamis even the president of the mormon church he met with scientists scholars entertainers the famous and the obscure and in each place he visited he met with local tibetan refugees struggling to make a life and prosper in their new country he worked morning till night traveling from city to city with such speed that one place seemed to merge into the next and yet not a single meeting or event on this tour was initiated at his own requestall were based on invitations from others and even more remarkableno matter how rigorous his schedule became he seemed to handle his work effortlessly he was happy doing it he did nothing not by a long shot no really i pressed what if someone persisted and asked you again well he laughed in that case i would probably say i just look after myself just take care of myself perhaps sensing my frustration with this glib response he smiled and continued i think maybe this answer isnt entirely serious but actually if you think about it thats true all six billion human beings in the world are just taking care of number one isnt it so whether one is a professional or whatever line of work one is in each of us from birth to death is just working to take care of ourselves thats our main task my attempt to pin him down on his job description was getting nowhere fast and this wasnt the first time i had noticed his natural reluctance to engage in discussion about his role in the world perhaps it was due to a certain lack of selfabsorption an absence of selfinvolvement i dont know but i decided to drop the subject of his job for now and turn to the wider issue well in working to take care of ourselves most people need some kind of job now many times in the past ive heard you say that the purpose of life is happiness thats right he affirmed so we need a way to be happy at work as well as at home but thats not always easy let me give you an example of a friend of mine i gave her a copy of the art of happiness shortly after it came out she told me that she kept it on her bedside table and read from it each night before she went to bed she was tremendously inspired by your words and she said that when she read it she felt it was really possible to be happy but then she told me when i go to bed im thinking that if i make the effort happiness is within my reach genuine happiness is out there waiting for me but then the next morning i have to get up at five oclock in the morning and face an hourlong commute to work and the minute i step into the office everything changesi have to deal with the pressures the demands my boss is a jerk and i cant stand my coworkers and suddenly it seems like the idea of happiness slips away it just evaporates things are so hectic that i barely have a chance to catch my breath let alone think about training my mind or inner development and of course the company i work for doesnt care a bit about my happiness but i need to work i need the money i cant just quit and expect to get another job so how can i find happiness at work and of course my friend isnt an isolated case i continued in many countries throughout the world there seems to be a kind of widespread dissatisfaction at work in fact i recently read a survey that reported that nearly half of american workers are dissatisfied at work unhappy with their jobs ive talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that and things seem to be getting worse according to the conference board the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent the dalai lama appeared surprised why is that he asked well according to the studies ive read there may be a variety of reasons ranging from inadequate compensation or simple boredom to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions there are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work poor social atmosphere lack of recognition not enough variety and other things in fact id be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors but let me give you an example a few days before leaving for dharamsala i had dinner with some friends who were both in the software industry and worked for large corporations they spent most of the dinner sitting around complaining about their jobs even though they worked for different companies one thing they both mentioned was that they felt they had no control over what they did every day they had no sense of autonomy no freedom to do their work in their own way they both complained that they didnt get enough information and direction from their bosses but once they were finally given a clearcut task or assignment they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way instead the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative they resented the fact that not only didnt they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do they couldnt even choose how to go about doing it so do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their feeling of autonomy or freedom at work i dont know the dalai lama responded of course it will completely depend on the persons individual circumstances what position they are in any general suggestions he reflected for a moment lets take the example of a prisoner now of course it is best not to be in prison but even in that situation where a person may be deprived of freedom he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make and even if somebody is in prison with very rigid rules they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations try to get some peace of mind so they can work on internal development in fact ive heard that there is a program here in india where prisoners are being taught meditation so im thinking that if people can do this under the extreme conditions of prison in the workplace people may try to discover small things small choices that they can make in how to go about their work and of course somebody may work on an assembly line with little variation in how to do their tasks but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes how they interact with their coworkers whether they utilize certain inner qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though the nature of the work may be difficult isnt it so perhaps that would help of course when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom that doesnt mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you in instances where the worker might be exploited where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical one should not simply think well this is my karma and take no action here it is not enough to think i should just be content if there is injustice then i think inaction is the wrong response the buddhist texts mention what is called misplaced tolerance or misplaced forbearance so for example in the case of tibetans in the face of chinese injustice generally misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive negative activity that is a misplaced forbearance and endurance similarly in the work environment if there is a lot of injustice and exploitation then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response the appropriate response really is to actively resist it to try to change this environment rather than accept it one should take some action what kind of action i asked of course it again depends on the situation the dalai lama said reasonably but perhaps one could speak with the boss with the management and try to change these things and if that doesnt work then revolt rebel he laughed this is what i generally say one needs to actively resist exploitation and in some cases one may simply need to quit and to look for other work well in todays world exploitation certainly goes on i agreed but in a lot of cases it isnt a matter of gross exploitation it may just be that the nature of the job is very demanding for example when the economy is slow companies are forced to cut back and lay off employees then the employees who are left have to take on more and more responsibility work becomes more stressful for those who remain any suggestions on how to cope more effectively with that type of situation that sort of pressure or stress of course it will vary from individual to individual how one emotionally and psychologically responds and it also depends upon the nature of work and the nature of the company he reminded me so there are many factors to take into account for example if you view your work as something that is really worthwhileif for instance there is a higher purpose to your workthen of course even if the work is very hard there may be a greater willingness to undergo that hardship under such circumstances you might think oh heres an opportunity to do something good for society so it depends but that kind of situation or attitude may not apply to everybody i pointed out so what im wondering about is a general approach to work overload which is actually one of the other common sources of work dissatisfaction what is this work overload what do you mean asked the dalai lama the genuine curiosity in his voice suggested that he had never heard of the concept well you know i said struggling for words where you are overloaded with work and it becomes a source of stress i still dont know what you mean by this term overload for example your boss could give you some work which you could probably finish within a certain amount of time but thats not overload because it is something you can accomplish even if it is difficult or he could give you an amount of work that is impossible to finish in a certain amount of time in which case you simply have to say i cant do this so what do you mean he wasnt getting it but i failed to understand why he didnt get it the concept of work overload isnt some obscure american custom or even something unique to western culture after all the japanese have even coined the word karoshideath by work overload i decided to frame it in his terms well lets say youre a young monk and youre studying and practicing buddhism so your teacher would be the equivalent of your boss ok right he nodded i understand and your job is to learn and memorize certain texts so lets say your boss gives you a text that you need to memorize by next week its a very challenging text now if you work hard maybe you can memorize it by next week but its going to be very difficult then he comes back a few hours later and says well now you have to memorize an additional text along with this text in the same amount of time and hes your bossyou cant just say im going to quit im not going to be a monk anymore so work overload in this context means that you are given more and more to do but not enough time to do it oh now i think i understand for example when i was around twenty in tibet i had to give an important teaching and for preparation i had homework early morning and late evening then i had to get up very early before my attendants arrived and even when my attendants had left late into the evening i had to read and memorize so i woke up a few hours earlier and went to bed a few hours laterthat is the kind of overload right but then this is something that with extra attention and energy its something i could achieve and that was ok for the short term but if i were to continue with this having less sleep for a long time having that kind of overload for a whole year then it would be impossible but thats the kind of thing many people are faced with these days i informed him so why cant these people say i cant do this right from the beginning he asked do they get fired in many cases yes in that case i think it goes back to knowing ones limitations and if a boss gives more work to do and it is beyond their capacity then i think they have to say something they have to say this is too much work for me and talk to the boss and try to reduce it if that doesnt work then they may need to look for new work however at that point lets say that the boss agrees to extra pay and the employee agrees then that is a persons decision and theres no cause to complain about overload but if the boss gives too much work without increase of salary then this overload is just exploitation the kind that we just spoke about but i think in these kinds of situations the employer has a responsibility to judge how much a person can reasonably be expected to do too much overload is simply a lack of concern lack of respect even overloading an animal is disrespectful to that lifeso thats exploitation its unfair he said with a resolute tone im glad that you mentioned the issue of unfairness i replied because that is another of the sources of workplace dissatisfaction in fact i think were touching upon some of the most common sources of dissatisfaction at the workplace in todays workplace environment theres often a focus solely on production productivityproduce produce produce now this may be changing slowly with more companies paying attention to creating a more humane environment but in many cases the organization doesnt care about the personal welfare of the employees or the inner state or satisfaction of the workersall it cares about is the bottom line making a bigger profit keeping the share prices high and this type of environment creates the conditions for all kinds of inequities unfairness stress for the employees and so on in view of that how can we maintain a feeling of calmness and inner satisfaction in an environment that is focused only on production and profit the dalai lama laughed howard some of your questions are so impossible it is almost as if you are asking how can beings in the hell realm learn to practice patience tolerance and tranquility there are not always easy answers in modern society you find many examples of unfairnessfor example corrupt leaders giving jobs or promotions to relatives instead of based on merit these things are plenty now here its difficult to get satisfaction how to deal with these things thats a problem like in the tibetan case were honest were not antichinese but the chinese falsely accuse us of things and engage in bullying tactics in tibet under those circumstances legally they are wrong we are right but still we suffer were defeated under those circumstances trying to get some satisfaction or some kind of peace of mind now thats hard work millions of people are subjected to various forms of unfairness isnt it we need to fight against injustice outwardly but at the same time we have to find ways to cope inwardly ways to train our minds to remain calm and not develop frustration hatred or despair thats the only solution we may find help from our belief systems whether we believe in karma or in god but we can also use our human intelligence to analyze the situation and to see it from a different perspective that will help he said with conviction referring to our many conversations over the years i continued in the past weve often spoken of training the mind as the key to happiness and that one way to train our minds is to use our human intelligence to use human reason and analysis to reshape our attitudes and outlook in fact this is a process which youve called analytic meditation thats right said the dalai lama so im wondering if you can take me through a specific example of this process lets say that were going for a promotion at work and we didnt get it were feeling really upset were feeling that its unfair or were jealous of the person who got the promotion how do we deal with that he replied thoughtfully it begins by deliberately analyzing whether responding with anger or jealousy for instance will benefit us or harm us in the long run we have to deeply reflect on whether responding in this way brings a happier and more peaceful state of mind or if those emotions serve to make us more unhappy and we need to relate it to our own past experiences thinking about the effect that these emotions have on our physical health as well as our mental state think about times when you felt strong jealousy or hatred in the past and find out whether it made your life more satisfying or helped you achieve your goals think about how others responded to you when you were showing strong anger or jealousy and analyze whether that helped you to have better relationships so think about these things until you are fully convinced of how damaging it is to ourselves to constantly respond to situations with hostility or jealousy and how beneficial are the positive emotions like tolerance or contentment ok lets say that im convinced that its destructive then what so you are going for a new job or promotion and you have the right qualifications and you are worthy but you didnt get the job first you think yes i deserved that job but if you didnt get it you have a choice of how you will respond you can be resentful and angry but then you can think about how destructive that kind of mental state can be that conviction alone will serve to make you more cautious of these emotions and may reduce them a bit so dont keep thinking about the work you dont have there will always be better jobs that you dont have dont continue to feel competitive or jealous that only brings more worry more dissatisfaction but you still need a way to bring some kind of peace of mind heres where we need to use our capacity for critical thinking for analysis you begin by realizing that no situation is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad sometimes particularly in the west ive noticed a tendency to think in blackorwhite terms but in reality everything in life is relative so based on this reality you can cultivate a wider perspective of the situation and try to see different angles you can further analyze realizing that with the better work and more money that doesnt mean that you would have no problems some other jobs may have higher pay but they come at a price maybe longer hours or more responsibility and maybe risk of injury or other kinds of problems in fact if you really look at others in the higher positions you may discover that there may be more demands there may be more competition or jealousy from others you might discover for instance that while your current work pays less it may be easier in some ways or even less dangerous in some instances so you continue to think about the reality thinking oh yes thats my bad luck i deserve that better job but since that didnt happen instead of looking only at the lack of the better job you could cultivate a wider perspective and see it from the other direction where you can think well yes this may pay less and is not the best work but since with this work i earn enough a sufficient amount for my family and for my survival im happy its ok so thinking along these lines we can build contentment with our job even when things dont go our way the dalai lama paused and sipped some tea so he continued i think through our own efforts through cultivating a wider perspective i think it is possible to become more content with our work of course theres still so much widespread dissatisfaction with ones work i mused im wondering if you have anything else to add here any other ways we can look at things to oh definitely he quickly replied another way to build contentment for example is simply to reflect on how fortunate one is to have the work how there are many people unable to get any kind of work you can think there are other good things in my life and i still have it better compared to many this is always the reality sometimes we forget that we get spoiled so for example in america there are many opportunities for employment and there is also a large degree of freedom and ones personal initiative can make a difference with personal initiative one can advance but at the same time there is still a lot of discontent and dissatisfaction with ones job in other parts of the world for example in countries like india and china there are fewer opportunities open for employment so under such circumstances many individuals cant get jobs but ive noticed that there the sense of satisfaction they derive from their job is much stronger and also they are more committed in the same way one can reflect on how much more difficult previous generations had it going through world wars and so on sometimes we tend to forget these things but if we think about it this can increase our feeling of gratitude and contentment of course youre right i agreed ive also been to many countries and ive seen coolies or baggage handlers here in india or migrant farm workers poor people working in rice paddies throughout asia or remote nomads in your own country and many of these people seem genuinely happy and content of that theres no doubt and i have to admit that we can become spoiled but my country america was built on personal initiative shouldnt we want to advance rather than just be content with the way things are yes howard but you shouldnt confuse contentment with complacency you shouldnt mistake being content with ones job with just sort of not caring not wanting to grow not wanting to learn just staying where one is even if ones situation is bad and not even making the effort to advance and to learn and to achieve something better if we have a poor job perhaps some unskilled labor but we have the skills and qualifications for better work by all means we should exert our best effort for the better work make a good attempt but if that fails then instead of frustration or becoming angry focusing only on the thought i tried but i wasnt able to make itthen think ok ill carry on with this work be content with the work you have so if you fail that is where ones attitude and the practice of contentment can make the difference between anger resentment and frustration and a calmer and happier attitude thats where training of the mind comes in these kinds of things lines of reasoning can diffuse your frustration and disturbance of mind so contentment i think contentmentthats the key thing while he spoke i thought about how difficult it might be for many people to adopt these lines of reasoning to diffuse their anger hatred and jealousy i realized that is why he has so often stressed the fact that it isnt easy to train ones mind and reshape ones attitudes that it takes repeated effort and it takes time for this kind of analytical meditation to work one needs deep and sustained reflection on these alternative ways of viewing ones situation one needs to be fully convinced of the absolute truth of this new perspective otherwise there is a danger of using these lines of reasoning merely as insincere rationalizations a matter of sour grapes oh yeah well i didnt want that job anyway so were going for that promotion and we lose out and we really wanted that promotionevery fiber of our being tells us that even aside from the higher pay the more important our job is the happier well be so how do we convince ourselves beyond a reasonable doubt that the more important job may not necessarily make us happier by looking at the evidence by examining whether were permanently happier from the last promotion we received or looking at people we know to see if those in a higher position are genuinely happier than those in a lower position or we can look at the scientific evidence in this case for instance while at suny buffalo robert rice phd a prolific scholar in the field of job satisfaction led a group that conducted a surprising study contrary to what one might expect they found that those with more important jobs are no happier in life than those with less important jobs this finding has been replicated in a number of similar widescale studies showing that while job satisfaction is linked with life satisfaction the specific type of work one does ones occupational prestige or whether a person is blue collar or white collar has little impact on ones overall life satisfaction theres an additional reason why it is sometimes a long and difficult process to reshape our attitudes and outlook to change the habitual ways that we perceive the world modify our customary interpretation and response to any given situation or event whats the reason when it comes down to it many of us resist giving up our miserya vexing and baffling feature of human behavior i often observed in the past when treating psychotherapy patients as miserable as some people might be for many there is a kind of perverse pleasure in the selfrighteous indignation one feels when one is treated unfairly we hold on to our pain wear it like a badge it becomes part of us and we are reluctant to give it up after all at least our characteristic ways of looking at the world are familiar letting go of our customary responses as destructive as they may be may seem frightening and often that fear abides on a deeply ingrained subconscious level and added to this of course are the secondary gains to holding on to our grudges jealousy and dissatisfaction as our constant complaints serve to elicit sympathy and understanding from others or at least we think so at least we hope so sometimes it worksour friends or coworkers join in with a catalogue of their own grievances and a bonding takes place as we indulge in our own little festival celebrating lifes inequities and the sins of our employers quite often however while our complaints may be received with outward expressions of sympathy they may more likely be met with inward annoyance by those who have problems of their own to deal with thinking about the difficulty of genuinely transforming our outlook and responding to these challenging situations in new ways i remarked i think these are all good practical suggestions although of course even if these things are true these lines of reasoning may not act as a consolation to everybody thats true the dalai lama admitted but my main point is that if there is a possibility to change your work environment then of course you have the right to make that attempt but you also need to understand the fundamental cause of various problems so once again this brings us to the reality that everything is interconnected if there are certain problems in the workplace or layoffs and one is having difficulty finding a job there are always many factors at play so you experience dissatisfaction you suffer maybe some worldwide economic conditions or even some environmental problems may be at the root of the problem in those cases it does no good to take things so personally and complain to the company or perhaps direct your anger toward one individual boss and your anger could even turn into hatred but even if your hatred escalates uncontrolled and even if eventually you killed that person it would have no effect on the situation it would do nothing to change the wider problems this kind of thing occurs for example in the tibetan community here in india there may be some people who are upset with the tibetan government in exile always complaining so focusing on some daytoday activities of the government they are dissatisfied but they tend to forget that the government in exile is exactly thatan exiled government and from that angle the fundamental cause of the problem is the chinese invasion and occupation of tibet which forced us into exile that is the source of the problem once they focus on the real issue it creates a sense of unity among us which creates a sense of greater satisfaction instead of the divisions and conflicts caused when we lose sight of the wider issues and start bickering among ourselves so instead of just complaining and complaining or directing your anger to a particular boss in that type of situation with your realization of the wider more fundamental causes of the problem it would be better if you redirected your thoughts think about the world the global economy think about the environment look at the various forms of social injustice perhaps you could even make a small contribution to improve things in some way of course i interjected theres often very little we can do to change these wider problems thats true the dalai lama conceded your efforts may have little or no results things may not change much but at least instead of misplaced anger and frustration you are transforming your mental energy turning it in a more constructive direction your underlying motivation can change based on this wider perspective and it will build your enthusiasm to work to make changes that will benefit society of course that takes time but meantime if you cant change the work environment or the wider forces that contribute to the work environment then you may need to change or adjust your outlook otherwise you will remain unhappy at work and in your life our meeting for the day was coming to a close and thinking that he had finished i began gathering up my notes when he suddenly added a final comment about the harsh reality of life yet despite his unsentimental acknowledgment of lifes difficulties there was a certain fearlessness mingled with a gentle undertone of compassion in his voice now look there will always be problems in life it is just not possible to go through life without encountering problems there is no event from which you get one hundred percent satisfaction right some dissatisfaction will always remain the better we are able to accept that fact the better we will be able to cope with lifes disappointments so take the example of a person who likes to eat sweet things but doesnt like sour things then there is a certain kind of fruit that this person enjoys that fruit may be mostly sweet but it may also have a little bit of sourness in it that person continues to enjoy the fruit they dont stop eating it because it has a little sour taste if they want to continue to enjoy eating that fruit they have to accept the little bit of sourness in it you cant separate the sweet from the sour in that piece of fruit it is always going to be mixed life is just like that as long as you are living life will have good things but also some problems that you dont like thats life so life is tough it seemed a grim truth upon which to be ending our meeting and as if perfectly staged to underscore that dark note at that moment there was a sudden crash of thunder and a deafening torrential downpour outside that muffled our words as we said goodbye an instant later the electricity went off an almost daily occurrence during this season in dharamsala the dalai lama was completely unruffled in fact his warm smile and cheerful manner were set off in bold relief against the darkened room and the ice storm raging outside clearly here was a happy man everything about him bespoke the possibility of leading a happy life despite lifes inevitable troubles he himself had weathered his fair share of problems the loss of an entire nation as he was forced into exile as a result of the communist chinese invasion and occupation of tibet and he continued to tackle difficult problems on a daily basisstruggling to preserve his cultural heritage fighting for the freedom of his people for the human rights of all people and often without success yet since the age of six he had been engaged in the training of his mind learning how to remain happy despite lifes unavoidable adversities it seems to have paid off so he reminds us that if we can change some of the external conditions at the workplace that contribute to our dissatisfaction we certainly should if not although it is always easy or quick it is still possible to be happy at work through reshaping our attitudes and outlook through inner training if contentwrittenno coresetid0 symacd contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite if contentwrittenno coresetid0 symexc

a group of newly arrived tibetan refugees they had made the arduous journey across the himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus but more likely to have caught a lift riding in the open bed of a shuddering pickup truck some had crossed the rugged border on foot climbing highaltitude passes with grim determination here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toecasualties of frostbite many arrived penniless destitute their traditional chubas native tibetan costumes tattered and dusty from the long journey in some of the older faces ruddy faces weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate one could detect traces of untold suffering spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the chinese communists for many of these people however a mere glimpse of the dalai lama the fulfillment of a lifelong dream was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy he offered them all young and old words of hope and encouragement as well as hardheaded practical advice ranging from education is critical to success to now you men should be careful of going with

here to collect our meetings were far from chatty tiacuteteyacutetiacutetes however in fact i often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile east and west pestering him with endless questions a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to answer that it had become a running joke between us trying even his legendary patience standing outside on his

unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day the dalai lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day so as i loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin i often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him on that day in particular i was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth thinking about this as i began our session i said you know i couldnt help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you people with various professions all sorts of jobs and i was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities now this week i want to focus on the topic of work yes good the dalai lama nodded and since were going to be talking about work this week i was just curious what do you consider to be your primary job the dalai lama looked puzzled what do you mean i was puzzled why he was puzzled it seemed to be a simple question well in the west i explained when you meet somebody often the first question you ask a stranger is what do you do meaning specifically what kind of work do you do whats your job so if you met a complete stranger and they didnt know you or had never heard of the dalai lama and they didnt even know what your monks robes signified they just met you as a human being and they asked you what do you do for a living what would you tell them the dalai lama reflected in silence for a long while and finally declared nothing i do nothing nothing in response to my blank stare he repeated himself if i was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer nothing nothing i didnt buy it he clearly worked as hard as anyone i knew harder even and as grueling as this day had been it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad in fact informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the us the year before i had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity dedication and hard work as a statesman he had met with president george w bush secretary of state colin powell and a host of highranking senators and members of congress as a teacher an ordained buddhist monk and consummate buddhist scholar he gave extensive lectures expounding the most subtle facets of buddhist philosophy as a nobel peace prize laureate and tireless advocate for world peace and human rights he gave public addresses to tens of thousands hundreds of thousands as a religious leader striving to promote interfaith dialogue and harmony he met with religious figures from many faiths priests rabbis ministers and swamis even the president of the mormon church he met with scientists scholars entertainers the famous and the obscure and in each place he visited he met with local tibetan refugees struggling to make a life and prosper in their new country he worked morning till night traveling from city to city with such speed that one place seemed to merge into the next and yet not a single meeting or event on this tour was initiated at his own requestall were based on invitations from others and even more remarkableno matter how rigorous his schedule became he seemed to handle his work effortlessly he was happy doing it he did nothing not by a long shot no really i pressed what if someone persisted and asked you again well he laughed in that case i would probably say i just look after myself just take care of myself perhaps sensing my frustration with this glib response he smiled and continued i think maybe this answer isnt entirely serious but actually if you think about it thats true all six billion human beings in the world are just taking care of number one isnt it so whether one is a professional or whatever line of work one is in each of us from birth to death is just working to take care of ourselves thats our main task my attempt to pin him down on his job description was getting nowhere fast and this wasnt the first time i had noticed his natural reluctance to engage in discussion about his role in the world perhaps it was due to a certain lack of selfabsorption an absence of selfinvolvement i dont know but i decided to drop the subject of his job for now and turn to the wider issue well in working to take care of ourselves most people need some kind of job now many times in the past ive heard you say that the purpose of life is happiness thats right he affirmed so we need a way to be happy at work as well as at home but thats not always easy let me give you an example of a friend of mine i gave her a copy of the art of happiness shortly after it came out she told me that she kept it on her bedside table and read from it each night before she went to bed she was tremendously inspired by your words and she said that when she read it she felt it was really possible to be happy but then she told me when i go to bed im thinking that if i make the effort happiness is within my reach genuine happiness is out there waiting for me but then the next morning i have to get up at five oclock in the morning and face an hourlong commute to work and the minute i step into the office everything changesi have to deal with the pressures the demands my boss is a jerk and i cant stand my coworkers and suddenly it seems like the idea of happiness slips away it just evaporates things are so hectic that i barely have a chance to catch my breath let alone think about training my mind or inner development and of course the company i work for doesnt care a bit about my happiness but i need to work i need the money i cant just quit and expect to get another job so how can i find happiness at work and of course my friend isnt an isolated case i continued in many countries throughout the world there seems to be a kind of widespread dissatisfaction at work in fact i recently read a survey that reported that nearly half of american workers are dissatisfied at work unhappy with their jobs ive talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that and things seem to be getting worse according to the conference board the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent the dalai lama appeared surprised why is that he asked well according to the studies ive read there may be a variety of reasons ranging from inadequate compensation or simple boredom to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions there are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work poor social atmosphere lack of recognition not enough variety and other things in fact id be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors but let me give you an example a few days before leaving for dharamsala i had dinner with some friends who were both in the software industry and worked for large corporations they spent most of the dinner sitting around complaining about their jobs even though they worked for different companies one thing they both mentioned was that they felt they had no control over what they did every day they had no sense of autonomy no freedom to do their work in their own way they both complained that they didnt get enough information and direction from their bosses but once they were finally given a clearcut task or assignment they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way instead the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative they resented the fact that not only didnt they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do they couldnt even choose how to go about doing it so do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their feeling of autonomy or freedom at work i dont know the dalai lama responded of course it will completely depend on the persons individual circumstances what position they are in any general suggestions he reflected for a moment lets take the example of a prisoner now of course it is best not to be in prison but even in that situation where a person may be deprived of freedom he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make and even if somebody is in prison with very rigid rules they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations try to get some peace of mind so they can work on internal development in fact ive heard that there is a program here in india where prisoners are being taught meditation so im thinking that if people can do this under the extreme conditions of prison in the workplace people may try to discover small things small choices that they can make in how to go about their work and of course somebody may work on an assembly line with little variation in how to do their tasks but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes how they interact with their coworkers whether they utilize certain inner qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though the nature of the work may be difficult isnt it so perhaps that would help of course when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom that doesnt mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you in instances where the worker might be exploited where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical one should not simply think well this is my karma and take no action here it is not enough to think i should just be content if there is injustice then i think inaction is the wrong response the buddhist texts mention what is called misplaced tolerance or misplaced forbearance so for example in the case of tibetans in the face of chinese injustice generally misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive negative activity that is a misplaced forbearance and endurance similarly in the work environment if there is a lot of injustice and exploitation then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response the appropriate response really is to actively resist it to try to change this environment rather than accept it one should take some action what kind of action i asked of course it again depends on the situation the dalai lama said reasonably but perhaps one could speak with the boss with the management and try to change these things and if that doesnt work then revolt rebel he laughed this is what i generally say one needs to actively resist exploitation and in some cases one may simply need to quit and to look for other work well in todays world exploitation certainly goes on i agreed but in a lot of cases it isnt a matter of gross exploitation it may just be that the nature of the job is very demanding for example when the economy is slow companies are forced to cut back and lay off employees then the employees who are left have to take on more and more responsibility work becomes more stressful for those who remain any suggestions on how to cope more effectively with that type of situation that sort of pressure or stress of course it will vary from individual to individual how one emotionally and psychologically responds and it also depends upon the nature of work and the nature of the company he reminded me so there are many factors to take into account for example if you view your work as something that is really worthwhileif for instance there is a higher purpose to your workthen of course even if the work is very hard there may be a greater willingness to undergo that hardship under such circumstances you might think oh heres an opportunity to do something good for society so it depends but that kind of situation or attitude may not apply to everybody i pointed out so what im wondering about is a general approach to work overload which is actually one of the other common sources of work dissatisfaction what is this work overload what do you mean asked the dalai lama the genuine curiosity in his voice suggested that he had never heard of the concept well you know i said struggling for words where you are overloaded with work and it becomes a source of stress i still dont know what you mean by this term overload for example your boss could give you some work which you could probably finish within a certain amount of time but thats not overload because it is something you can accomplish even if it is difficult or he could give you an amount of work that is impossible to finish in a certain amount of time in which case you simply have to say i cant do this so what do you mean he wasnt getting it but i failed to understand why he didnt get it the concept of work overload isnt some obscure american custom or even something unique to western culture after all the japanese have even coined the word karoshideath by work overload i decided to frame it in his terms well lets say youre a young monk and youre studying and practicing buddhism so your teacher would be the equivalent of your boss ok right he nodded i understand and your job is to learn and memorize certain texts so lets say your boss gives you a text that you need to memorize by next week its a very challenging text now if you work hard maybe you can memorize it by next week but its going to be very difficult then he comes back a few hours later and says well now you have to memorize an additional text along with this text in the same amount of time and hes your bossyou cant just say im going to quit im not going to be a monk anymore so work overload in this context means that you are given more and more to do but not enough time to do it oh now i think i understand for example when i was around twenty in tibet i had to give an important teaching and for preparation i had homework early morning and late evening then i had to get up very early before my attendants arrived and even when my attendants had left late into the evening i had to read and memorize so i woke up a few hours earlier and went to bed a few hours laterthat is the kind of overload right but then this is something that with extra attention and energy its something i could achieve and that was ok for the short term but if i were to continue with this having less sleep for a long time having that kind of overload for a whole year then it would be impossible but thats the kind of thing many people are faced with these days i informed him so why cant these people say i cant do this right from the beginning he asked do they get fired in many cases yes in that case i think it goes back to knowing ones limitations and if a boss gives more work to do and it is beyond their capacity then i think they have to say something they have to say this is too much work for me and talk to the boss and try to reduce it if that doesnt work then they may need to look for new work however at that point lets say that the boss agrees to extra pay and the employee agrees then that is a persons decision and theres no cause to complain about overload but if the boss gives too much work without increase of salary then this overload is just exploitation the kind that we just spoke about but i think in these kinds of situations the employer has a responsibility to judge how much a person can reasonably be expected to do too much overload is simply a lack of concern lack of respect even overloading an animal is disrespectful to that lifeso thats exploitation its unfair he said with a resolute tone im glad that you mentioned the issue of unfairness i replied because that is another of the sources of workplace dissatisfaction in fact i think were touching upon some of the most common sources of dissatisfaction at the workplace in todays workplace environment theres often a focus solely on production productivityproduce produce produce now this may be changing slowly with more companies paying attention to creating a more humane environment but in many cases the organization doesnt care about the personal welfare of the employees or the inner state or satisfaction of the workersall it cares about is the bottom line making a bigger profit keeping the share prices high and this type of environment creates the conditions for all kinds of inequities unfairness stress for the employees and so on in view of that how can we maintain a feeling of calmness and inner satisfaction in an environment that is focused only on production and profit the dalai lama laughed howard some of your questions are so impossible it is almost as if you are asking how can beings in the hell realm learn to practice patience tolerance and tranquility there are not always easy answers in modern society you find many examples of unfairnessfor example corrupt leaders giving jobs or promotions to relatives instead of based on merit these things are plenty now here its difficult to get satisfaction how to deal with these things thats a problem like in the tibetan case were honest were not antichinese but the chinese falsely accuse us of things and engage in bullying tactics in tibet under those circumstances legally they are wrong we are right but still we suffer were defeated under those circumstances trying to get some satisfaction or some kind of peace of mind now thats hard work millions of people are subjected to various forms of unfairness isnt it we need to fight against injustice outwardly but at the same time we have to find ways to cope inwardly ways to train our minds to remain calm and not develop frustration hatred or despair thats the only solution we may find help from our belief systems whether we believe in karma or in god but we can also use our human intelligence to analyze the situation and to see it from a different perspective that will help he said with conviction referring to our many conversations over the years i continued in the past weve often spoken of training the mind as the key to happiness and that one way to train our minds is to use our human intelligence to use human reason and analysis to reshape our attitudes and outlook in fact this is a process which youve called analytic meditation thats right said the dalai lama so im wondering if you can take me through a specific example of this process lets say that were going for a promotion at work and we didnt get it were feeling really upset were feeling that its unfair or were jealous of the person who got the promotion how do we deal with that he replied thoughtfully it begins by deliberately analyzing whether responding with anger or jealousy for instance will benefit us or harm us in the long run we have to deeply reflect on whether responding in this way brings a happier and more peaceful state of mind or if those emotions serve to make us more unhappy and we need to relate it to our own past experiences thinking about the effect that these emotions have on our physical health as well as our mental state think about times when you felt strong jealousy or hatred in the past and find out whether it made your life more satisfying or helped you achieve your goals think about how others responded to you when you were showing strong anger or jealousy and analyze whether that helped you to have better relationships so think about these things until you are fully convinced of how damaging it is to ourselves to constantly respond to situations with hostility or jealousy and how beneficial are the positive emotions like tolerance or contentment ok lets say that im convinced that its destructive then what so you are going for a new job or promotion and you have the right qualifications and you are worthy but you didnt get the job first you think yes i deserved that job but if you didnt get it you have a choice of how you will respond you can be resentful and angry but then you can think about how destructive that kind of mental state can be that conviction alone will serve to make you more cautious of these emotions and may reduce them a bit so dont keep thinking about the work you dont have there will always be better jobs that you dont have dont continue to feel competitive or jealous that only brings more worry more dissatisfaction but you still need a way to bring some kind of peace of mind heres where we need to use our capacity for critical thinking for analysis you begin by realizing that no situation is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad sometimes particularly in the west ive noticed a tendency to think in blackorwhite terms but in reality everything in life is relative so based on this reality you can cultivate a wider perspective of the situation and try to see different angles you can further analyze realizing that with the better work and more money that doesnt mean that you would have no problems some other jobs may have higher pay but they come at a price maybe longer hours or more responsibility and maybe risk of injury or other kinds of problems in fact if you really look at others in the higher positions you may discover that there may be more demands there may be more competition or jealousy from others you might discover for instance that while your current work pays less it may be easier in some ways or even less dangerous in some instances so you continue to think about the reality thinking oh yes thats my bad luck i deserve that better job but since that didnt happen instead of looking only at the lack of the better job you could cultivate a wider perspective and see it from the other direction where you can think well yes this may pay less and is not the best work but since with this work i earn enough a sufficient amount for my family and for my survival im happy its ok so thinking along these lines we can build contentment with our job even when things dont go our way the dalai lama paused and sipped some tea so he continued i think through our own efforts through cultivating a wider perspective i think it is possible to become more content with our work of course theres still so much widespread dissatisfaction with ones work i mused im wondering if you have anything else to add here any other ways we can look at things to oh definitely he quickly replied another way to build contentment for example is simply to reflect on how fortunate one is to have the work how there are many people unable to get any kind of work you can think there are other good things in my life and i still have it better compared to many this is always the reality sometimes we forget that we get spoiled so for example in america there are many opportunities for employment and there is also a large degree of freedom and ones personal initiative can make a difference with personal initiative one can advance but at the same time there is still a lot of discontent and dissatisfaction with ones job in other parts of the world for example in countries like india and china there are fewer opportunities open for employment so under such circumstances many individuals cant get jobs but ive noticed that there the sense of satisfaction they derive from their job is much stronger and also they are more committed in the same way one can reflect on how much more difficult previous generations had it going through world wars and so on sometimes we tend to forget these things but if we think about it this can increase our feeling of gratitude and contentment of course youre right i agreed ive also been to many countries and ive seen coolies or baggage handlers here in india or migrant farm workers poor people working in rice paddies throughout asia or remote nomads in your own country and many of these people seem genuinely happy and content of that theres no doubt and i have to admit that we can become spoiled but my country america was built on personal initiative shouldnt we want to advance rather than just be content with the way things are yes howard but you shouldnt confuse contentment with complacency you shouldnt mistake being content with ones job with just sort of not caring not wanting to grow not wanting to learn just staying where one is even if ones situation is bad and not even making the effort to advance and to learn and to achieve something better if we have a poor job perhaps some unskilled labor but we have the skills and qualifications for better work by all means we should exert our best effort for the better work make a good attempt but if that fails then instead of frustration or becoming angry focusing only on the thought i tried but i wasnt able to make itthen think ok ill carry on with this work be content with the work you have so if you fail that is where ones attitude and the practice of contentment can make the difference between anger resentment and frustration and a calmer and happier attitude thats where training of the mind comes in these kinds of things lines of reasoning can diffuse your frustration and disturbance of mind so contentment i think contentmentthats the key thing while he spoke i thought about how difficult it might be for many people to adopt these lines of reasoning to diffuse their anger hatred and jealousy i realized that is why he has so often stressed the fact that it isnt easy to train ones mind and reshape ones attitudes that it takes repeated effort and it takes time for this kind of analytical meditation to work one needs deep and sustained reflection on these alternative ways of viewing ones situation one needs to be fully convinced of the absolute truth of this new perspective otherwise there is a danger of using these lines of reasoning merely as insincere rationalizations a matter of sour grapes oh yeah well i didnt want that job anyway so were going for that promotion and we lose out and we really wanted that promotionevery fiber of our being tells us that even aside from the higher pay the more important our job is the happier well be so how do we convince ourselves beyond a reasonable doubt that the more important job may not necessarily make us happier by looking at the evidence by examining whether were permanently happier from the last promotion we received or looking at people we know to see if those in a higher position are genuinely happier than those in a lower position or we can look at the scientific evidence in this case for instance while at suny buffalo robert rice phd a prolific scholar in the field of job satisfaction led a group that conducted a surprising study contrary to what one might expect they found that those with more important jobs are no happier in life than those with less important jobs this finding has been replicated in a number of similar widescale studies showing that while job satisfaction is linked with life satisfaction the specific type of work one does ones occupational prestige or whether a person is blue collar or white collar has little impact on ones overall life satisfaction theres an additional reason why it is sometimes a long and difficult process to reshape our attitudes and outlook to change the habitual ways that we perceive the world modify our customary interpretation and response to any given situation or event whats the reason when it comes down to it many of us resist giving up our miserya vexing and baffling feature of human behavior i often observed in the past when treating psychotherapy patients as miserable as some people might be for many there is a kind of perverse pleasure in the selfrighteous indignation one feels when one is treated unfairly we hold on to our pain wear it like a badge it becomes part of us and we are reluctant to give it up after all at least our characteristic ways of looking at the world are familiar letting go of our customary responses as destructive as they may be may seem frightening and often that fear abides on a deeply ingrained subconscious level and added to this of course are the secondary gains to holding on to our grudges jealousy and dissatisfaction as our constant complaints serve to elicit sympathy and understanding from others or at least we think so at least we hope so sometimes it worksour friends or coworkers join in with a catalogue of their own grievances and a bonding takes place as we indulge in our own little festival celebrating lifes inequities and the sins of our employers quite often however while our complaints may be received with outward expressions of sympathy they may more likely be met with inward annoyance by those who have problems of their own to deal with thinking about the difficulty of genuinely transforming our outlook and responding to these challenging situations in new ways i remarked i think these are all good practical suggestions although of course even if these things are true these lines of reasoning may not act as a consolation to everybody thats true the dalai lama admitted but my main point is that if there is a possibility to change your work environment then of course you have the right to make that attempt but you also need to understand the fundamental cause of various problems so once again this brings us to the reality that everything is interconnected if there are certain problems in the workplace or layoffs and one is having difficulty finding a job there are always many factors at play so you experience dissatisfaction you suffer maybe some worldwide economic conditions or even some environmental problems may be at the root of the problem in those cases it does no good to take things so personally and complain to the company or perhaps direct your anger toward one individual boss and your anger could even turn into hatred but even if your hatred escalates uncontrolled and even if eventually you killed that person it would have no effect on the situation it would do nothing to change the wider problems this kind of thing occurs for example in the tibetan community here in india there may be some people who are upset with the tibetan government in exile always complaining so focusing on some daytoday activities of the government they are dissatisfied but they tend to forget that the government in exile is exactly thatan exiled government and from that angle the fundamental cause of the problem is the chinese invasion and occupation of tibet which forced us into exile that is the source of the problem once they focus on the real issue it creates a sense of unity among us which creates a sense of greater satisfaction instead of the divisions and conflicts caused when we lose sight of the wider issues and start bickering among ourselves so instead of just complaining and complaining or directing your anger to a particular boss in that type of situation with your realization of the wider more fundamental causes of the problem it would be better if you redirected your thoughts think about the world the global economy think about the environment look at the various forms of social injustice perhaps you could even make a small contribution to improve things in some way of course i interjected theres often very little we can do to change these wider problems thats true the dalai lama conceded your efforts may have little or no results things may not change much but at least instead of misplaced anger and frustration you are transforming your mental energy turning it in a more constructive direction your underlying motivation can change based on this wider perspective and it will build your enthusiasm to work to make changes that will benefit society of course that takes time but meantime if you cant change the work environment or the wider forces that contribute to the work environment then you may need to change or adjust your outlook otherwise you will remain unhappy at work and in your life our meeting for the day was coming to a close and thinking that he had finished i began gathering up my notes when he suddenly added a final comment about the harsh reality of life yet despite his unsentimental acknowledgment of lifes difficulties there was a certain fearlessness mingled with a gentle undertone of compassion in his voice now look there will always be problems in life it is just not possible to go through life without encountering problems there is no event from which you get one hundred percent satisfaction right some dissatisfaction will always remain the better we are able to accept that fact the better we will be able to cope with lifes disappointments so take the example of a person who likes to eat sweet things but doesnt like sour things then there is a certain kind of fruit that this person enjoys that fruit may be mostly sweet but it may also have a little bit of sourness in it that person continues to enjoy the fruit they dont stop eating it because it has a little sour taste if they want to continue to enjoy eating that fruit they have to accept the little bit of sourness in it you cant separate the sweet from the sour in that piece of fruit it is always going to be mixed life is just like that as long as you are living life will have good things but also some problems that you dont like thats life so life is tough it seemed a grim truth upon which to be ending our meeting and as if perfectly staged to underscore that dark note at that moment there was a sudden crash of thunder and a deafening torrential downpour outside that muffled our words as we said goodbye an instant later the electricity went off an almost daily occurrence during this season in dharamsala the dalai lama was completely unruffled in fact his warm smile and cheerful manner were set off in bold relief against the darkened room and the ice storm raging outside clearly here was a happy man everything about him bespoke the possibility of leading a happy life despite lifes inevitable troubles he himself had weathered his fair share of problems the loss of an entire nation as he was forced into exile as a result of the communist chinese invasion and occupation of tibet and he continued to tackle difficult problems on a daily basisstruggling to preserve his cultural heritage fighting for the freedom of his people for the human rights of all people and often without success yet since the age of six he had been engaged in the training of his mind learning how to remain happy despite lifes unavoidable adversities it seems to have paid off so he reminds us that if we can change some of the external conditions at the workplace that contribute to our dissatisfaction we certainly should if not although it is always easy or quick it is still possible to be happy at work through reshaping our attitudes and outlook through inner training if contentwrittenno coresetid0 symrev contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite if contentwrittenno coresetid0 symque contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite

happiness at work it spent nearly two years on the new york times bestseller list and has sold well over a million copies in hardcover it remains five years later in its original hardcover edition it was the book by the dalai lama that broke new ground that made him accessible to a larger audience spreading his words of wisdom and message of inner peace that captured the imagination of america his holiness the dalai lama for the first time since that revolutionary book has once again teamed up with psychiatrist howard cutler to resume the discussion about what makes life meaningful begun in the art of happiness over the past several years howard cutler has continued his conversations with the dalai lama asking him the questions we all want answered about how to find happiness in the place we spend most of our time workwhether its in the home or at an officeis what mostly runs our lives we depend on it to eat to clothe and shelter ourselves and to take care of our families once again dr cutler brings forward seminal studies and asks the dalai lama to respond beginning with a direct correlation between productivity and happiness dr cutler questions his holiness about the nature of work in psychiatry and according to the dalai lama our motivation for working determines our level of satisfaction the book explores these three levels of focus survival focus on salary stability food and clothing career focus on advancement calling focus on work as a higher purpose cutler probes the dalai lamas wisdom by posing these questions how does the relationship between our personal values and those of our employers affect happiness what is the relationship between selfawareness and work what are the main sources of dissatisfaction and how can we cope with them how do we deal with conflicts with coworkers and bosses how do we deal with jealousy anger or hostility at work how does the lack of freedom affect our levels of happiness how do we deal with boredom or lack of challenge unfair criticism overly demanding or taxing situations job change and unemployment once again cutler walks us through the dalai lamas reasoning so that we know how to apply the wisdom to daily life

coresetid10 symexc contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite chapter 1 transforming dissatisfaction at work it had been a long day for the dalai lama even by the time he had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 730 am he had already been up for four hours completing his rigorous daily regimen of prayer study and meditation after breakfast he began his usual workday and that day there was a full lineup meeting with one person after another he saw an indian government liaison officer the head lama of one of the ancient lineages of tibetan buddhism the president of a member republic of the russian federation a high official in the tibetan governmentinexile and various members of his private office staff and scheduled among these private meetings i watched with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived tibetan refugees they had made the arduous journey across the himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus but more likely to have caught a lift riding in the open bed of a shuddering pickup truck some had crossed the rugged border on foot climbing highaltitude passes with grim determination here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toecasualties of frostbite many arrived penniless destitute their traditional chubas native tibetan costumes tattered and dusty from the long journey in some of the older faces ruddy faces weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate one could detect traces of untold suffering spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the chinese communists for many of these people however a mere glimpse of the dalai lama the fulfillment of a lifelong dream was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy he offered them all young and old words of hope and encouragement as well as hardheaded practical advice ranging from education is critical to success to now you men should be careful of going with prostitutesyou could catch a disease finally it was 2 pm his last scheduled appointment for the day and here was i i had been allotted several hours each afternoon to collaborate on our book and i was here to collect our meetings were far from chatty tiacuteteyacutetiacutetes however in fact i often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile east and west pestering him with endless questions a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to answer that it had become a running joke between us trying even his legendary patience standing outside on his bougainvilleadraped porch with the majestic snowcapped dhauladhar mountains of northern india as a backdrop the dalai lama greeted me warmly as he led me inside his home little had changed in this room since our first meeting twenty years before the same traditional tibetan thanka paintings lined the pale yellow walls the same buddhist shrine covered with ornate buddhist icons at one end of the room and the same floortoceiling relief map of tibet dominating the opposite wall even the modest furniture appeared to be the same although its possible the sofa may have been reupholstered as i unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day the dalai lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day so as i loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin i often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him on that day in particular i was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth thinking about this as i began our session i said you know i couldnt help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you people with various professions all sorts of jobs and i was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities now this week i want to focus on the topic of work yes good the dalai lama nodded and since were going to be talking about work this week i was just curious what do you consider to be your primary job the dalai lama looked puzzled what do you mean i was puzzled why he was puzzled it seemed to be a simple question well in the west i explained when you meet somebody often the first question you ask a stranger is what do you do meaning specifically what kind of work do you do whats your job so if you met a complete stranger and they didnt know you or had never heard of the dalai lama and they didnt even know what your monks robes signified they just met you as a human being and they asked you what do you do for a living what would you tell them the dalai lama reflected in silence for a long while and finally declared nothing i do nothing nothing in response to my blank stare he repeated himself if i was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer nothing nothing i didnt buy it he clearly worked as hard as anyone i knew harder even and as grueling as this day had been it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad in fact informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the us the year before i had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity dedication and hard work as a statesman he had met with president george w bush secretary of state colin powell and a host of highranking senators and members of congress as a teacher an ordained buddhist monk and consummate buddhist scholar he gave extensive lectures expounding the most subtle facets of buddhist philosophy as a nobel peace prize laureate and tireless advocate for world peace and human rights he gave public addresses to tens of thousands hundreds of thousands as a religious leader striving to promote interfaith dialogue and harmony he met with religious figures from many faiths priests rabbis ministers and swamis even the president of the mormon church he met with scientists scholars entertainers the famous and the obscure and in each place he visited he met with local tibetan refugees struggling to make a life and prosper in their new country he worked morning till night traveling from city to city with such speed that one place seemed to merge into the next and yet not a single meeting or event on this tour was initiated at his own requestall were based on invitations from others and even more remarkableno matter how rigorous his schedule became he seemed to handle his work effortlessly he was happy doing it he did nothing not by a long shot no really i pressed what if someone persisted and asked you again well he laughed in that case i would probably say i just look after myself just take care of myself perhaps sensing my frustration with this glib response he smiled and continued i think maybe this answer isnt entirely serious but actually if you think about it thats true all six billion human beings in the world are just taking care of number one isnt it so whether one is a professional or whatever line of work one is in each of us from birth to death is just working to take care of ourselves thats our main task my attempt to pin him down on his job description was getting nowhere fast and this wasnt the first time i had noticed his natural reluctance to engage in discussion about his role in the world perhaps it was due to a certain lack of selfabsorption an absence of selfinvolvement i dont know but i decided to drop the subject of his job for now and turn to the wider issue well in working to take care of ourselves most people need some kind of job now many times in the past ive heard you say that the purpose of life is happiness thats right he affirmed so we need a way to be happy at work as well as at home but thats not always easy let me give you an example of a friend of mine i gave her a copy of the art of happiness shortly after it came out she told me that she kept it on her bedside table and read from it each night before she went to bed she was tremendously inspired by your words and she said that when she read it she felt it was really possible to be happy but then she told me when i go to bed im thinking that if i make the effort happiness is within my reach genuine happiness is out there waiting for me but then the next morning i have to get up at five oclock in the morning and face an hourlong commute to work and the minute i step into the office everything changesi have to deal with the pressures the demands my boss is a jerk and i cant stand my coworkers and suddenly it seems like the idea of happiness slips away it just evaporates things are so hectic that i barely have a chance to catch my breath let alone think about training my mind or inner development and of course the company i work for doesnt care a bit about my happiness but i need to work i need the money i cant just quit and expect to get another job so how can i find happiness at work and of course my friend isnt an isolated case i continued in many countries throughout the world there seems to be a kind of widespread dissatisfaction at work in fact i recently read a survey that reported that nearly half of american workers are dissatisfied at work unhappy with their jobs ive talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that and things seem to be getting worse according to the conference board the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent the dalai lama appeared surprised why is that he asked well according to the studies ive read there may be a variety of reasons ranging from inadequate compensation or simple boredom to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions there are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work poor social atmosphere lack of recognition not enough variety and other things in fact id be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors but let me give you an example a few days before leaving for dharamsala i had dinner with some friends who were both in the software industry and worked for large corporations they spent most of the dinner sitting around complaining about their jobs even though they worked for different companies one thing they both mentioned was that they felt they had no control over what they did every day they had no sense of autonomy no freedom to do their work in their own way they both complained that they didnt get enough information and direction from their bosses but once they were finally given a clearcut task or assignment they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way instead the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative they resented the fact that not only didnt they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do they couldnt even choose how to go about doing it so do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their feeling of autonomy or freedom at work i dont know the dalai lama responded of course it will completely depend on the persons individual circumstances what position they are in any general suggestions he reflected for a moment lets take the example of a prisoner now of course it is best not to be in prison but even in that situation where a person may be deprived of freedom he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make and even if somebody is in prison with very rigid rules they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations try to get some peace of mind so they can work on internal development in fact ive heard that there is a program here in india where prisoners are being taught meditation so im thinking that if people can do this under the extreme conditions of prison in the workplace people may try to discover small things small choices that they can make in how to go about their work and of course somebody may work on an assembly line with little variation in how to do their tasks but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes how they interact with their coworkers whether they utilize certain inner qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though the nature of the work may be difficult isnt it so perhaps that would help of course when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom that doesnt mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you in instances where the worker might be exploited where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical one should not simply think well this is my karma and take no action here it is not enough to think i should just be content if there is injustice then i think inaction is the wrong response the buddhist texts mention what is called misplaced tolerance or misplaced forbearance so for example in the case of tibetans in the face of chinese injustice generally misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive negative activity that is a misplaced forbearance and endurance similarly in the work environment if there is a lot of injustice and exploitation then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response the appropriate response really is to actively resist it to try to change this environment rather than accept it one should take some action what kind of action i asked of course it again depends on the situation the dalai lama said reasonably but perhaps one could speak with the boss with the management and try to change these things and if that doesnt work then revolt rebel he laughed this is what i generally say one needs to actively resist exploitation and in some cases one may simply need to quit and to look for other work well in todays world exploitation certainly goes on i agreed but in a lot of cases it isnt a matter of gross exploitation it may just be that the nature of the job is very demanding for example when the economy is slow companies are forced to cut back and lay off employees then the employees who are left have to take on more and more responsibility work becomes more stressful for those who remain any suggestions on how to cope more effectively with that type of situation that sort of pressure or stress of course it will vary from individual to individual how one emotionally and psychologically responds and it also depends upon the nature of work and the nature of the company he reminded me so there are many factors to take into account for example if you view your work as something that is really worthwhileif for instance there is a higher purpose to your workthen of course even if the work is very hard there may be a greater willingness to undergo that hardship under such circumstances you might think oh heres an opportunity to do something good for society so it depends but that kind of situation or attitude may not apply to everybody i pointed out so what im wondering about is a general approach to work overload which is actually one of the other common sources of work dissatisfaction what is this work overload what do you mean asked the dalai lama the genuine curiosity in his voice suggested that he had never heard of the concept well you know i said struggling for words where you are overloaded with work and it becomes a source of stress i still dont know what you mean by this term overload for example your boss could give you some work which you could probably finish within a certain amount of time but thats not overload because it is something you can accomplish even if it is difficult or he could give you an amount of work that is impossible to finish in a certain amount of time in which case you simply have to say i cant do this so what do you mean he wasnt getting it but i failed to understand why he didnt get it the concept of work overload isnt some obscure american custom or even something unique to western culture after all the japanese have even coined the word karoshideath by work overload i decided to frame it in his terms well lets say youre a young monk and youre studying and practicing buddhism so your teacher would be the equivalent of your boss ok right he nodded i understand and your job is to learn and memorize certain texts so lets say your boss gives you a text that you need to memorize by next week its a very challenging text now if you work hard maybe you can memorize it by next week but its going to be very difficult then he comes back a few hours later and says well now you have to memorize an additional text along with this text in the same amount of time and hes your bossyou cant just say im going to quit im not going to be a monk anymore so work overload in this context means that you are given more and more to do but not enough time to do it oh now i think i understand for example when i was around twenty in tibet i had to give an important teaching and for preparation i had homework early morning and late evening then i had to get up very early before my attendants arrived and even when my attendants had left late into the evening i had to read and memorize so i woke up a few hours earlier and went to bed a few hours laterthat is the kind of overload right but then this is something that with extra attention and energy its something i could achieve and that was ok for the short term but if i were to continue with this having less sleep for a long time having that kind of overload for a whole year then it would be impossible but thats the kind of thing many people are faced with these days i informed him so why cant these people say i cant do this right from the beginning he asked do they get fired in many cases yes in that case i think it goes back to knowing ones limitations and if a boss gives more work to do and it is beyond their capacity then i think they have to say something they have to say this is too much work for me and talk to the boss and try to reduce it if that doesnt work then they may need to look for new work however at that point lets say that the boss agrees to extra pay and the employee agrees then that is a persons decision and theres no cause to complain about overload but if the boss gives too much work without increase of salary then this overload is just exploitation the kind that we just spoke about but i think in these kinds of situations the employer has a responsibility to judge how much a person can reasonably be expected to do too much overload is simply a lack of concern lack of respect even overloading an animal is disrespectful to that lifeso thats exploitation its unfair he said with a resolute tone im glad that you mentioned the issue of unfairness i replied because that is another of the sources of workplace dissatisfaction in fact i think were touching upon some of the most common sources of dissatisfaction at the workplace in todays workplace environment theres often a focus solely on production productivityproduce produce produce now this may be changing slowly with more companies paying attention to creating a more humane environment but in many cases the organization doesnt care about the personal welfare of the employees or the inner state or satisfaction of the workersall it cares about is the bottom line making a bigger profit keeping the share prices high and this type of environment creates the conditions for all kinds of inequities unfairness stress for the employees and so on in view of that how can we maintain a feeling of calmness and inner satisfaction in an environment that is focused only on production and profit the dalai lama laughed howard some of your questions are so impossible it is almost as if you are asking how can beings in the hell realm learn to practice patience tolerance and tranquility there are not always easy answers in modern society you find many examples of unfairnessfor example corrupt leaders giving jobs or promotions to relatives instead of based on merit these things are plenty now here its difficult to get satisfaction how to deal with these things thats a problem like in the tibetan case were honest were not antichinese but the chinese falsely accuse us of things and engage in bullying tactics in tibet under those circumstances legally they are wrong we are right but still we suffer were defeated under those circumstances trying to get some satisfaction or some kind of peace of mind now thats hard work millions of people are subjected to various forms of unfairness isnt it we need to fight against injustice outwardly but at the same time we have to find ways to cope inwardly ways to train our minds to remain calm and not develop frustration hatred or despair thats the only solution we may find help from our belief systems whether we believe in karma or in god but we can also use our human intelligence to analyze the situation and to see it from a different perspective that will help he said with conviction referring to our many conversations over the years i continued in the past weve often spoken of training the mind as the key to happiness and that one way to train our minds is to use our human intelligence to use human reason and analysis to reshape our attitudes and outlook in fact this is a process which youve called analytic meditation thats right said the dalai lama so im wondering if you can take me through a specific example of this process lets say that were going for a promotion at work and we didnt get it were feeling really upset were feeling that its unfair or were jealous of the person who got the promotion how do we deal with that he replied thoughtfully it begins by deliberately analyzing whether responding with anger or jealousy for instance will benefit us or harm us in the long run we have to deeply reflect on whether responding in this way brings a happier and more peaceful state of mind or if those emotions serve to make us more unhappy and we need to relate it to our own past experiences thinking about the effect that these emotions have on our physical health as well as our mental state think about times when you felt strong jealousy or hatred in the past and find out whether it made your life more satisfying or helped you achieve your goals think about how others responded to you when you were showing strong anger or jealousy and analyze whether that helped you to have better relationships so think about these things until you are fully convinced of how damaging it is to ourselves to constantly respond to situations with hostility or jealousy and how beneficial are the positive emotions like tolerance or contentment ok lets say that im convinced that its destructive then what so you are going for a new job or promotion and you have the right qualifications and you are worthy but you didnt get the job first you think yes i deserved that job but if you didnt get it you have a choice of how you will respond you can be resentful and angry but then you can think about how destructive that kind of mental state can be that conviction alone will serve to make you more cautious of these emotions and may reduce them a bit so dont keep thinking about the work you dont have there will always be better jobs that you dont have dont continue to feel competitive or jealous that only brings more worry more dissatisfaction but you still need a way to bring some kind of peace of mind heres where we need to use our capacity for critical thinking for analysis you begin by realizing that no situation is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad sometimes particularly in the west ive noticed a tendency to think in blackorwhite terms but in reality everything in life is relative so based on this reality you can cultivate a wider perspective of the situation and try to see different angles you can further analyze realizing that with the better work and more money that doesnt mean that you would have no problems some other jobs may have higher pay but they come at a price maybe longer hours or more responsibility and maybe risk of injury or other kinds of problems in fact if you really look at others in the higher positions you may discover that there may be more demands there may be more competition or jealousy from others you might discover for instance that while your current work pays less it may be easier in some ways or even less dangerous in some instances so you continue to think about the reality thinking oh yes thats my bad luck i deserve that better job but since that didnt happen instead of looking only at the lack of the better job you could cultivate a wider perspective and see it from the other direction where you can think well yes this may pay less and is not the best work but since with this work i earn enough a sufficient amount for my family and for my survival im happy its ok so thinking along these lines we can build contentment with our job even when things dont go our way the dalai lama paused and sipped some tea so he continued i think through our own efforts through cultivating a wider perspective i think it is possible to become more content with our work of course theres still so much widespread dissatisfaction with ones work i mused im wondering if you have anything else to add here any other ways we can look at things to oh definitely he quickly replied another way to build contentment for example is simply to reflect on how fortunate one is to have the work how there are many people unable to get any kind of work you can think there are other good things in my life and i still have it better compared to many this is always the reality sometimes we forget that we get spoiled so for example in america there are many opportunities for employment and there is also a large degree of freedom and ones personal initiative can make a difference with personal initiative one can advance but at the same time there is still a lot of discontent and dissatisfaction with ones job in other parts of the world for example in countries like india and china there are fewer opportunities open for employment so under such circumstances many individuals cant get jobs but ive noticed that there the sense of satisfaction they derive from their job is much stronger and also they are more committed in the same way one can reflect on how much more difficult previous generations had it going through world wars and so on sometimes we tend to forget these things but if we think about it this can increase our feeling of gratitude and contentment of course youre right i agreed ive also been to many countries and ive seen coolies or baggage handlers here in india or migrant farm workers poor people working in rice paddies throughout asia or remote nomads in your own country and many of these people seem genuinely happy and content of that theres no doubt and i have to admit that we can become spoiled but my country america was built on personal initiative shouldnt we want to advance rather than just be content with the way things are yes howard but you shouldnt confuse contentment with complacency you shouldnt mistake being content with ones job with just sort of not caring not wanting to grow not wanting to learn just staying where one is even if ones situation is bad and not even making the effort to advance and to learn and to achieve something better if we have a poor job perhaps some unskilled labor but we have the skills and qualifications for better work by all means we should exert our best effort for the better work make a good attempt but if that fails then instead of frustration or becoming angry focusing only on the thought i tried but i wasnt able to make itthen think ok ill carry on with this work be content with the work you have so if you fail that is where ones attitude and the practice of contentment can make the difference between anger resentment and frustration and a calmer and happier attitude thats where training of the mind comes in these kinds of things lines of reasoning can diffuse your frustration and disturbance of mind so contentment i think contentmentthats the key thing while he spoke i thought about how difficult it might be for many people to adopt these lines of reasoning to diffuse their anger hatred and jealousy i realized that is why he has so often stressed the fact that it isnt easy to train ones mind and reshape ones attitudes that it takes repeated effort and it takes time for this kind of analytical meditation to work one needs deep and sustained reflection on these alternative ways of viewing ones situation one needs to be fully convinced of the absolute truth of this new perspective otherwise there is a danger of using these lines of reasoning merely as insincere rationalizations a matter of sour grapes oh yeah well i didnt want that job anyway so were going for that promotion and we lose out and we really wanted that promotionevery fiber of our being tells us that even aside from the higher pay the more important our job is the happier well be so how do we convince ourselves beyond a reasonable doubt that the more important job may not necessarily make us happier by looking at the evidence by examining whether were permanently happier from the last promotion we received or looking at people we know to see if those in a higher position are genuinely happier than those in a lower position or we can look at the scientific evidence in this case for instance while at suny buffalo robert rice phd a prolific scholar in the field of job satisfaction led a group that conducted a surprising study contrary to what one might expect they found that those with more important jobs are no happier in life than those with less important jobs this finding has been replicated in a number of similar widescale studies showing that while job satisfaction is linked with life satisfaction the specific type of work one does ones occupational prestige or whether a person is blue collar or white collar has little impact on ones overall life satisfaction theres an additional reason why it is sometimes a long and difficult process to reshape our attitudes and outlook to change the habitual ways that we perceive the world modify our customary interpretation and response to any given situation or event whats the reason when it comes down to it many of us resist giving up our miserya vexing and baffling feature of human behavior i often observed in the past when treating psychotherapy patients as miserable as some people might be for many there is a kind of perverse pleasure in the selfrighteous indignation one feels when one is treated unfairly we hold on to our pain wear it like a badge it becomes part of us and we are reluctant to give it up after all at least our characteristic ways of looking at the world are familiar letting go of our customary responses as destructive as they may be may seem frightening and often that fear abides on a deeply ingrained subconscious level and added to this of course are the secondary gains to holding on to our grudges jealousy and dissatisfaction as our constant complaints serve to elicit sympathy and understanding from others or at least we think so at least we hope so sometimes it worksour friends or coworkers join in with a catalogue of their own grievances and a bonding takes place as we indulge in our own little festival celebrating lifes inequities and the sins of our employers quite often however while our complaints may be received with outward expressions of sympathy they may more likely be met with inward annoyance by those who have problems of their own to deal with thinking about the difficulty of genuinely transforming our outlook and responding to these challenging situations in new ways i remarked i think these are all good practical suggestions although of course even if these things are true these lines of reasoning may not act as a consolation to everybody thats true the dalai lama admitted but my main point is that if there is a possibility to change your work environment then of course you have the right to make that attempt but you also need to understand the fundamental cause of various problems so once again this brings us to the reality that everything is interconnected if there are certain problems in the workplace or layoffs and one is having difficulty finding a job there are always many factors at play so you experience dissatisfaction you suffer maybe some worldwide economic conditions or even some environmental problems may be at the root of the problem in those cases it does no good to take things so personally and complain to the company or perhaps direct your anger toward one individual boss and your anger could even turn into hatred but even if your hatred escalates uncontrolled and even if eventually you killed that person it would have no effect on the situation it would do nothing to change the wider problems this kind of thing occurs for example in the tibetan community here in india there may be some people who are upset with the tibetan government in exile always complaining so focusing on some daytoday activities of the government they are dissatisfied but they tend to forget that the government in exile is exactly thatan exiled government and from that angle the fundamental cause of the problem is the chinese invasion and occupation of tibet which forced us into exile that is the source of the problem once they focus on the real issue it creates a sense of unity among us which creates a sense of greater satisfaction instead of the divisions and conflicts caused when we lose sight of the wider issues and start bickering among ourselves so instead of just complaining and complaining or directing your anger to a particular boss in that type of situation with your realization of the wider more fundamental causes of the problem it would be better if you redirected your thoughts think about the world the global economy think about the environment look at the various forms of social injustice perhaps you could even make a small contribution to improve things in some way of course i interjected theres often very little we can do to change these wider problems thats true the dalai lama conceded your efforts may have little or no results things may not change much but at least instead of misplaced anger and frustration you are transforming your mental energy turning it in a more constructive direction your underlying motivation can change based on this wider perspective and it will build your enthusiasm to work to make changes that will benefit society of course that takes time but meantime if you cant change the work environment or the wider forces that contribute to the work environment then you may need to change or adjust your outlook otherwise you will remain unhappy at work and in your life our meeting for the day was coming to a close and thinking that he had finished i began gathering up my notes when he suddenly added a final comment about the harsh reality of life yet despite his unsentimental acknowledgment of lifes difficulties there was a certain fearlessness mingled with a gentle undertone of compassion in his voice now look there will always be problems in life it is just not possible to go through life without encountering problems there is no event from which you get one hundred percent satisfaction right some dissatisfaction will always remain the better we are able to accept that fact the better we will be able to cope with lifes disappointments so take the example of a person who likes to eat sweet things but doesnt like sour things then there is a certain kind of fruit that this person enjoys that fruit may be mostly sweet but it may also have a little bit of sourness in it that person continues to enjoy the fruit they dont stop eating it because it has a little sour taste if they want to continue to enjoy eating that fruit they have to accept the little bit of sourness in it you cant separate the sweet from the sour in that piece of fruit it is always going to be mixed life is just like that as long as you are living life will have good things but also some problems that you dont like thats life so life is tough it seemed a grim truth upon which to be ending our meeting and as if perfectly staged to underscore that dark note at that moment there was a sudden crash of thunder and a deafening torrential downpour outside that muffled our words as we said goodbye an instant later the electricity went off an almost daily occurrence during this season in dharamsala the dalai lama was completely unruffled in fact his warm smile and cheerful manner were set off in bold relief against the darkened room and the ice storm raging outside clearly here was a happy man everything about him bespoke the possibility of leading a happy life despite lifes inevitable troubles he himself had weathered his fair share of problems the loss of an entire nation as he was forced into exile as a result of the communist chinese invasion and occupation of tibet and he continued to tackle difficult problems on a daily basisstruggling to preserve his cultural heritage fighting for the freedom of his people for the human rights of all people and often without success yet since the age of six he had been engaged in the training of his mind learning how to remain happy despite lifes unavoidable adversities it seems to have paid off so he reminds us that if we can change some of the external conditions at the workplace that contribute to our dissatisfaction we certainly should if not although it is always easy or quick it is still possible to be happy at work through reshaping our attitudes and outlook through inner training if contentwrittenno coresetid10 symrev contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite if contentwrittenno coresetid10 symque contentwrittenyes documentwrite else

the ultimate happiness at work it spent nearly two years on the new york times bestseller list and has sold well over a million copies in hardcover it remains five years later in its original hardcover edition it was the book by the dalai lama that broke new ground that made him accessible to a larger audience spreading his words of wisdom and message of inner peace that captured the imagination of america his holiness the dalai lama for the first time since that revolutionary book has once again teamed up with psychiatrist howard cutler to resume the discussion about what makes life meaningful begun in the art of happiness over the past several years howard cutler has continued his conversations with the dalai lama asking him the questions we all want answered about how to find happiness in the place we spend most of our time workwhether its in the home or at an officeis what mostly runs our lives we depend on it to eat to clothe and shelter ourselves and to take care of our families once again dr cutler brings forward seminal studies and asks the dalai lama to respond beginning with a direct correlation between productivity and happiness dr cutler questions his holiness about the nature of work in psychiatry and according to the dalai lama our motivation for working determines our level of satisfaction the book explores these three levels of focus survival focus on salary stability food and clothing career focus on advancement calling focus on work as a higher purpose cutler probes the dalai lamas wisdom by posing these questions how does the relationship between our personal values and those of our employers affect happiness what is the relationship between selfawareness and work what are the main sources of dissatisfaction and how can we cope with them how do we deal with conflicts with coworkers and bosses how do we deal with jealousy anger or hostility at work how does the lack of freedom affect our levels of happiness how do we deal with boredom or lack of challenge unfair criticism overly demanding or taxing situations job change and unemployment once again cutler walks us through the dalai lamas reasoning so that we know how to apply the wisdom to daily life this is an invaluable source of strength and peace for anyone who earns a livingnbsp if contentwrittenno coresetid50 symexc contentwrittenyes documentwrite else documentwrite chapter 1 transforming dissatisfaction at work it had been a long day for the dalai lama even by the time he had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 730 am he had already been up for four hours completing his rigorous daily regimen of prayer study and meditation after breakfast he began his usual workday and that day there was a full lineup meeting with one person after another he saw an indian government liaison officer the head lama of one of the ancient lineages of tibetan buddhism the president of a member republic of the russian federation a high official in the tibetan governmentinexile and various members of his private office staff and scheduled among these private meetings i watched with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived tibetan refugees they had made the arduous journey across the himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus but more likely to have caught a lift riding in the open bed of a shuddering pickup truck some had crossed the rugged border on foot climbing highaltitude passes with grim determination here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toecasualties of frostbite many arrived penniless destitute their traditional chubas native tibetan costumes tattered and dusty from the long journey in some of the older faces ruddy faces weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate one could detect traces of untold suffering spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the chinese communists for many of these people however a mere glimpse of the dalai lama the fulfillment of a lifelong dream was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy he offered them all young and old words of hope and encouragement as well as hardheaded practical advice ranging from education is critical to success to now you men should be careful of going with prostitutesyou could catch a disease finally it was 2 pm his last scheduled appointment for the day and here was i i had been allotted several hours each afternoon to collaborate on our book and i was here to collect our meetings were far from chatty tiacuteteyacutetiacutetes however in fact i often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile east and west pestering him with endless questions a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to answer that it had become a running joke between us trying even his legendary patience standing outside on his bougainvilleadraped porch with the majestic snowcapped dhauladhar mountains of northern india as a backdrop the dalai lama greeted me warmly as he led me inside his home little had changed in this room since our first meeting twenty years before the same traditional tibetan thanka paintings lined the pale yellow walls the same buddhist shrine covered with ornate buddhist icons at one end of the room and the same floortoceiling relief map of tibet dominating the opposite wall even the modest furniture appeared to be the same although its possible the sofa may have been reupholstered as i unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day the dalai lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day so as i loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin i often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him on that day in particular i was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth thinking about this as i began our session i said you know i couldnt help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you people with various professions all sorts of jobs and i was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities now this week i want to focus on the topic of work yes good the dalai lama nodded and since were going to be talking about work this week i was just curious what do you consider to be your primary job the dalai lama looked puzzled what do you mean i was puzzled why he was puzzled it seemed to be a simple question well in the west i explained when you meet somebody often the first question you ask a stranger is what do you do meaning specifically what kind of work do you do whats your job so if you met a complete stranger and they didnt know you or had never heard of the dalai lama and they didnt even know what your monks robes signified they just met you as a human being and they asked you what do you do for a living what would you tell them the dalai lama reflected in silence for a long while and finally declared nothing i do nothing nothing in response to my blank stare he repeated himself if i was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer nothing nothing i didnt buy it he clearly worked as hard as anyone i knew harder even and as grueling as this day had been it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad in fact informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the us the year before i had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity dedication and hard work as a statesman he had met with president george w bush secretary of state colin powell and a host of highranking senators and members of congress as a teacher an ordained buddhist monk and consummate buddhist scholar he gave extensive lectures expounding the most subtle facets of buddhist philosophy as a nobel peace prize laureate and tireless advocate for world peace and human rights he gave public addresses to tens of thousands hundreds of thousands as a religious leader striving to promote interfaith dialogue and harmony he met with religious figures from many faiths priests rabbis ministers and swamis even the president of the mormon church he met with scientists scholars entertainers the famous and the obscure and in each place he visited he met with local tibetan refugees struggling to make a life and prosper in their new country he worked morning till night traveling from city to city with such speed that one place seemed to merge into the next and yet not a single meeting or event on this tour was initiated at his own requestall were based on invitations from others and even more remarkableno matter how rigorous his schedule became he seemed to handle his work effortlessly he was happy doing it he did nothing not by a long shot no really i pressed what if someone persisted and asked you again well he laughed in that case i would probably say i just look after myself just take care of myself perhaps sensing my frustration with this glib response he smiled and continued i think maybe this answer isnt entirely serious but actually if you think about it thats true all six billion human beings in the world are just taking care of number one isnt it so whether one is a professional or whatever line of work one is in each of us from birth to death is just working to take care of ourselves thats our main task my attempt to pin him down on his job description was getting nowhere fast and this wasnt the first time i had noticed his natural reluctance to engage in discussion about his role in the world perhaps it was due to a certain lack of selfabsorption an absence of selfinvolvement i dont know but i decided to drop the subject of his job for now and turn to the wider issue well in working to take care of ourselves most people need some kind of job now many times in the past ive heard you say that the purpose of life is happiness thats right he affirmed so we need a way to be happy at work as well as at home but thats not always easy let me give you an example of a friend of mine i gave her a copy of the art of happiness shortly after it came out she told me that she kept it on her bedside table and read from it each night before she went to bed she was tremendously inspired by your words and she said that when she read it she felt it was really possible to be happy but then she told me when i go to bed im thinking that if i make the effort happiness is within my reach genuine happiness is out there waiting for me but then the next morning i have to get up at five oclock in the morning and face an hourlong commute to work and the minute i step into the office everything changesi have to deal with the pressures the demands my boss is a jerk and i cant stand my coworkers and suddenly it seems like the idea of happiness slips away it just evaporates things are so hectic that i barely have a chance to catch my breath let alone think about training my mind or inner development and of course the company i work for doesnt care a bit about my happiness but i need to work i need the money i cant just quit and expect to get another job so how can i find happiness at work and of course my friend isnt an isolated case i continued in many countries throughout the world there seems to be a kind of widespread dissatisfaction at work in fact i recently read a survey that reported that nearly half of american workers are dissatisfied at work unhappy with their jobs ive talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that and things seem to be getting worse according to the conference board the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent the dalai lama appeared surprised why is that he asked well according to the studies ive read there may be a variety of reasons ranging from inadequate compensation or simple boredom to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions there are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work poor social atmosphere lack of recognition not enough variety and other things in fact id be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors but let me give you an example a few days before leaving for dharamsala i had dinner with some friends who were both in the software industry and worked for large corporations they spent most of the dinner sitting around complaining about their jobs even though they worked for different companies one thing they both mentioned was that they felt they had no control over what they did every day they had no sense of autonomy no freedom to do their work in their own way they both complained that they didnt get enough information and direction from their bosses but once they were finally given a clearcut task or assignment they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way instead the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative they resented the fact that not only didnt they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do they couldnt even choose how to go about doing it so do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their feeling of autonomy or freedom at work i dont know the dalai lama responded of course it will completely depend on the persons individual circumstances what position they are in any general suggestions he reflected for a moment lets take the example of a prisoner now of course it is best not to be in prison but even in that situation where a person may be deprived of freedom he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make and even if somebody is in prison with very rigid rules they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations try to get some peace of mind so they can work on internal development in fact ive heard that there is a program here in india where prisoners are being taught meditation so im thinking that if people can do this under the extreme conditions of prison in the workplace people may try to discover small things small choices that they can make in how to go about their work and of course somebody may work on an assembly line with little variation in how to do their tasks but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes how they interact with their coworkers whether they utilize certain inner qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though the nature of the work may be difficult isnt it so perhaps that would help of course when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom that doesnt mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you in instances where the worker might be exploited where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical one should not simply think well this is my karma and take no action here it is not enough to think i should just be content if there is injustice then i think inaction is the wrong response the buddhist texts mention what is called misplaced tolerance or misplaced forbearance so for example in the case of tibetans in the face of chinese injustice generally misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive negative activity that is a misplaced forbearance and endurance similarly in the work environment if there is a lot of injustice and exploitation then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response the appropriate response really is to actively resist it to try to change this environment rather than accept it one should take some action what kind of action i asked of course it again depends on the situation the dalai lama said reasonably but perhaps one could speak with the boss with the management and try to change these things and if that doesnt work then revolt rebel he laughed this is what i generally say one needs to actively resist exploitation and in some cases one may simply need to quit and to look for other work well in todays world exploitation certainly goes on i agreed but in a lot of cases it isnt a matter of gross exploitation it may just be that the nature of the job is very demanding for example when the economy is slow companies are forced to cut back and lay off employees then the employees who are left have to take on more and more responsibility work becomes more stressful for those who remain any suggestions on how to cope more effectively with that type of situation that sort of pressure or stress of course it will vary from individual to individual how one emotionally and psychologically responds and it also depends upon the nature of work and the nature of the company he reminded me so there are many factors to take into account for example if you view your work as something that is really worthwhileif for instance there is a higher purpose to your workthen of course even if the work is very hard there may be a greater willingness to undergo that hardship under such circumstances you might think oh heres an opportunity to do something good for society so it depends but that kind of situation or attitude may not apply to everybody i pointed out so what im wondering about is a general approach to work overload which is actually one of the other common sources of work dissatisfaction what is this work overload what do you mean asked the dalai lama the genuine curiosity in his voice suggested that he had never heard of the concept well you know i said struggling for words where you are overloaded with work and it becomes a source of stress i still dont know what you mean by this term overload for example your boss could give you some work which you could probably finish within a certain amount of time but thats not overload because it is something you can accomplish even if it is difficult or he could give you an amount of work that is impossible to finish in a certain amount of time in which case you simply have to say i cant do this so what do you mean he wasnt getting it but i failed to understand why he didnt get it the concept of work overload isnt some obscure american custom or even something unique to western culture after all the japanese have even coined the word karoshideath by work overload i decided to frame it in his terms well lets say youre a young monk and youre studying and practicing buddhism so your teacher would be the equivalent of your boss ok right he nodded i understand and your job is to learn and memorize certain texts so lets say your boss gives you a text that you need to memorize by next week its a very challenging text now if you work hard maybe you can memorize it by next week but its going to be very difficult then he comes back a few hours later and says well now you have to memorize an additional text along with this text in the same amount of time and hes your bossyou cant just say im going to quit im not going to be a monk anymore so work overload in this context means that you are given more and more to do but not enough time to do it oh now i think i understand for example when i was around twenty in tibet i had to give an important teaching and for preparation i had homework early morning and late evening then i had to get up very early before my attendants arrived and even when my attendants had left late into the evening i had to read and memorize so i woke up a few hours earlier and went to bed a few hours laterthat is the kind of overload right but then this is something that with extra attention and energy its something i could achieve and that was ok for the short term but if i were to continue with this having less sleep for a long time having that kind of overload for a whole year then it would be impossible but thats the kind of thing many people are faced with these days i informed him so why cant these people say i cant do this right from the beginning he asked do they get fired in many cases yes in that case i think it goes back to knowing ones limitations and if a boss gives more work to do and it is beyond their capacity then i think they have to say something they have to say this is too much work for me and talk to the boss and try to reduce it if that doesnt work then they may need to look for new work however at that point lets say that the boss agrees to extra pay and the employee agrees then that is a persons decision and theres no cause to complain about overload but if the boss gives too much work without increase of salary then this overload is just exploitation the kind that we just spoke about but i think in these kinds of situations the employer has a responsibility to judge how much a person can reasonably be expected to do too much overload is simply a lack of concern lack of respect even overloading an animal is disrespectful to that lifeso thats exploitation its unfair he said with a resolute tone im glad that you mentioned the issue of unfairness i replied because that is another of the sources of workplace dissatisfaction in fact i think were touching upon some of the most common sources of dissatisfaction at the workplace in todays workplace environment theres often a focus solely on production productivityproduce produce produce now this may be changing slowly with more companies paying attention to creating a more humane environment but in many cases the organization doesnt care about the personal welfare of the employees or the inner state or satisfaction of the workersall it cares about is the bottom line making a bigger profit keeping the share prices high and this type of environment creates the conditions for all kinds of inequities unfairness stress for the employees and so on in view of that how can we maintain a feeling of calmness and inner satisfaction in an environment that is focused only on production and profit the dalai lama laughed howard some of your questions are so impossible it is almost as if you are asking how can beings in the hell realm learn to practice patience tolerance and tranquility there are not always easy answers in modern society you find many examples of unfairnessfor example corrupt leaders giving jobs or promotions to relatives instead of based on merit these things are plenty now here its difficult to get satisfaction how to deal with these things thats a problem like in the tibetan case were honest were not antichinese but the chinese falsely accuse us of things and engage in bullying tactics in tibet under those circumstances legally they are wrong we are right but still we suffer were defeated under those circumstances trying to get some satisfaction or some kind of peace of mind now thats hard work millions of people are subjected to various forms of unfairness isnt it we need to fight against injustice outwardly but at the same time we have to find ways to cope inwardly ways to train our minds to remain calm and not develop frustration hatred or despair thats the only solution we may find help from our belief systems whether we believe in karma or in god but we can also use our human intelligence to analyze the situation and to see it from a different perspective that will help he said with conviction referring to our many conversations over the years i continued in the past weve often spoken of training the mind as the key to happiness and that one way to train our minds is to use our human intelligence to use human reason and analysis to reshape our attitudes and outlook in fact this is a process which youve called analytic meditation thats right said the dalai lama so im wondering if you can take me through a specific example of this process lets say that were going for a promotion at work and we didnt get it were feeling really upset were feeling that its unfair or were jealous of the person who got the promotion how do we deal with that he replied thoughtfully it begins by deliberately analyzing whether responding with anger or jealousy for instance will benefit us or harm us in the long run we have to deeply reflect on whether responding in this way brings a happier and more peaceful state of mind or if those emotions serve to make us more unhappy and we need to relate it to our own past experiences thinking about the effect that these emotions have on our physical health as well as our mental state think about times when you felt strong jealousy or hatred in the past and find out whether it made your life more satisfying or helped you achieve your goals think about how others responded to you when you were showing strong anger or jealousy and analyze whether that helped you to have better relationships so think about these things until you are fully convinced of how damaging it is to ourselves to constantly respond to situations with hostility or jealousy and how beneficial are the positive emotions like tolerance or contentment ok lets say that im convinced that its destructive then what so you are going for a new job or promotion and you have the right qualifications and you are worthy but you didnt get the job first you think yes i deserved that job but if you didnt get it you have a choice of how you will respond you can be resentful and angry but then you can think about how destructive that kind of mental state can be that conviction alone will serve to make you more cautious of these emotions and may reduce them a bit so dont keep thinking about the work you dont have there will always be better jobs that you dont have dont continue to feel competitive or jealous that only brings more worry more dissatisfaction but you still need a way to bring some kind of peace of mind heres where we need to use our capacity for critical thinking for analysis you begin by realizing that no situation is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad sometimes particularly in the west ive noticed a tendency to think in blackorwhite terms but in reality everything in life is relative so based on this reality you can cultivate a wider perspective of the situation and try to see different angles you can further analyze realizing that with the better work and more money that doesnt mean that you would have no problems some other jobs may have higher pay but they come at a price maybe longer hours or more responsibility and maybe risk of injury or other kinds of problems in fact if you really look at others in the higher positions you may discover that there may be more demands there may be more competition or jealousy from others you might discover for instance that while your current work pays less it may be easier in some ways or even less dangerous in some instances so you continue to think about the reality thinking oh yes thats my bad luck i deserve that better job but since that didnt happen instead of looking only at the lack of the better job you could cultivate a wider perspective and see it from the other direction where you can think well yes this may pay less and is not the best work but since with this work i earn enough a sufficient amount for my family and for my survival im happy its ok so thinking along these lines we can build contentment with our job even when things dont go our way the dalai lama paused and sipped some tea so he continued i think through our own efforts through cultivating a wider perspective i think it is possible to become more content with our work of course theres still so much widespread dissatisfaction with ones work i mused im wondering if you have anything else to add here any other ways we can look at things to oh definitely he quickly replied another way to build contentment for example is simply to reflect on how fortunate one is to have the work how there are many people unable to get any kind of work you can think there are other good things in my life and i still have it better compared to many this is always the reality sometimes we forget that we get spoiled so for example in america there are many opportunities for employment and there is also a large degree of freedom and ones personal initiative can make a difference with personal initiative one can advance but at the same time there is still a lot of discontent and dissatisfaction with ones job in other parts of the world for example in countries like india and china there are fewer opportunities open for employment so under such circumstances many individuals cant get jobs but ive noticed that there the sense of satisfaction they derive from their job is much stronger and also they are more committed in the same way one can reflect on how much more difficult previous generations had it going through world wars and so on sometimes we tend to forget these things but if we think about it this can increase our feeling of gratitude and contentment of course youre right i agreed ive also been to many countries and ive seen coolies or baggage handlers here in india or migrant farm workers poor people working in rice paddies throughout asia or remote nomads in your own country and many of these people seem genuinely happy and content of that theres no doubt and i have to admit that we can become spoiled but my country america was built on personal initiative shouldnt we want to advance rather than just be content with the way things are yes howard but you shouldnt confuse contentment with complacency you shouldnt mistake being content with ones job with just sort of not caring not wanting to grow not wanting to learn just staying where one is even if ones situation is bad and not even making the effort to advance and to learn and to achieve something better if we have a poor job perhaps some unskilled labor but we have the skills and qualifications for better work by all means we should exert our best effort for the better work make a good attempt but if that fails then instead of frustration or becoming angry focusing only on the thought i tried but i wasnt able to make itthen think ok ill carry on with this work be content with the work you have so if you fail that is where ones attitude and the practice of contentment can make the difference between anger resentment and frustration and a calmer and happier attitude thats where training of the mind comes in these kinds of things lines of reasoning can diffuse your frustration and disturbance of mind so contentment i think contentmentthats the key thing while he spoke i thought about how difficult it might be for many people to adopt these lines of reasoning to diffuse their anger hatred and jealousy i realized that is why he has so often stressed the fact that it isnt easy to train ones mind and reshape ones attitudes that it takes repeated effort and it takes time for this kind of analytical meditation to work one needs deep and sustained reflection on these alternative ways of viewing ones situation one needs to be fully convinced of the absolute truth of this new perspective otherwise there is a danger of using these lines of reasoning merely as insincere rationalizations a matter of sour grapes oh yeah well i didnt want that job anyway so were going for that promotion and we lose out and we really wanted that promotionevery fiber of our being tells us that even aside from the higher pay the more important our job is the happier well be so how do we convince ourselves beyond a reasonable doubt that the more important job may not necessarily make us happier by looking at the evidence by examining whether were permanently happier from the last promotion we received or looking at people we know to see if those in a higher position are genuinely happier than those in a lower position or we can look at the scientific evidence in this case for instance while at suny buffalo robert rice phd a prolific scholar in the field of job satisfaction led a group that conducted a surprising study contrary to what one might expect they found that those with more important jobs are no happier in life than those with less important jobs this finding has been replicated in a number of similar widescale studies showing that while job satisfaction is linked with life satisfaction the specific type of work one does ones occupational prestige or whether a person is blue collar or white collar has little impact on ones overall life satisfaction theres an additional reason why it is sometimes a long and difficult process to reshape our attitudes and outlook to change the habitual ways that we perceive the world modify our customary interpretation and response to any given situation or event whats the reason when it comes down to it many of us resist giving up our miserya vexing and baffling feature of human behavior i often observed in the past when treating psychotherapy patients as miserable as some people might be for many there is a kind of perverse pleasure in the selfrighteous indignation one feels when one is treated unfairly we hold on to our pain wear it like a badge it becomes part of us and we are reluctant to give it up after all at least our characteristic ways of looking at the world are familiar letting go of our customary responses as destructive as they may be may seem frightening and often that fear abides on a deeply ingrained subconscious level and added to this of course are the secondary gains to holding on to our grudges jealousy and dissatisfaction as our constant complaints serve to elicit sympathy and understanding from others or at least we think so at least we hope so sometimes it worksour friends or coworkers join in with a catalogue of their own grievances and a bonding takes place as we indulge in our own little festival celebrating lifes inequities and the sins of our employers quite often however while our complaints may be received with outward expressions of sympathy they may more likely be met with inward annoyance by those who have problems of their own to deal with thinking about the difficulty of genuinely transforming our outlook and responding to these challenging situations in new ways i remarked i think these are all good practical suggestions although of course even if these things are true these lines of reasoning may not act as a consolation to everybody thats true the dalai lama admitted but my main point is that if there is a possibility to change your work environment then of course you have the right to make that attempt but you also need to understand the fundamental cause of various problems so once again this brings us to the reality that everything is interconnected if there are certain problems in the workplace or layoffs and one is having difficulty finding a job there are always many factors at play so you experience dissatisfaction you suffer maybe some worldwide economic conditions or even some environmental problems may be at the root of the problem in those cases it does no good to take things so personally and complain to the company or perhaps direct your anger toward one individual boss and your anger could even turn into hatred but even if your hatred escalates uncontrolled and even if eventually you killed that person it would have no effect on the situation it would do nothing to change the wider problems this kind of thing occurs for example in the tibetan community here in india there may be some people who are upset with the tibetan government in exile always complaining so focusing on some daytoday activities of the government they are dissatisfied but they tend to forget that the government in exile is exactly thatan exiled government and from that angle the fundamental cause of the problem is the chinese invasion and occupation of tibet which forced us into exile that is the source of the problem once they focus on the real issue it creates a sense of unity among us which creates a sense of greater satisfaction instead of the divisions and conflicts caused when we lose sight of the wider issues and start bickering among ourselves so instead of just complaining and complaining or directing your anger to a particular boss in that type of situation with your realization of the wider more fundamental causes of the problem it would be better if you redirected your thoughts think about the world the global economy think about the environment look at the various forms of social injustice perhaps you could even make a small contribution to improve things in some way of course i interjected theres often very little we can do to change these wider problems thats true the dalai lama conceded your efforts may have little or no results things may not change much but at least instead of misplaced anger and frustration you are transforming your mental energy turning it in a more constructive direction your underlying motivation can change based on this wider perspective and it will build your enthusiasm to work to make changes that will benefit society of course that takes time but meantime if you cant change the work environment or the wider forces that contribute to the work environment then you may need to change or adjust your outlook otherwise you will remain unhappy at work and in your life our meeting for the day was coming to a close and thinking that he had finished i began gathering up my notes when he suddenly added a final comment about the harsh reality of life yet despite his unsentimental acknowledgment of lifes difficulties there was a certain fearlessness mingled with a gentle undertone of compassion in his voice now look there will always be problems in life it is just not possible to go through life without encountering problems there is no event from which you get one hundred percent satisfaction right some dissatisfaction will always remain the better we are able to accept that fact the better we will be able to cope with lifes disappointments so take the example of a person who likes to eat sweet things but doesnt like sour things then there is a certain kind of fruit that this person enjoys that fruit may be mostly sweet but it may also have a little bit of sourness in it that person continues to enjoy the fruit they dont stop eating it because it has a little sour taste if they want to continue to enjoy eating that fruit they have to accept the little bit of sourness in it you cant separate the sweet from the sour in that piece of fruit it is always going to be mixed life is just like that as long as you are living life will have good things but also some problems that you dont like thats life so life is tough it seemed a grim truth upon which to be ending our meeting and as if perfectly staged to underscore that dark note at that moment there was a sudden crash of thunder and a deafening torrential downpour outside that muffled our words as we said goodbye an instant later the electricity went off an almost daily occurrence during this season in dharamsala the dalai lama was completely unruffled in fact his warm smile and cheerful manner were set off in bold relief against the darkened room and the ice storm raging outside clearly here was a happy man everything about him bespoke the possibility of leading a happy life despite lifes inevitable troubles he himself had weathered his fair share of problems the loss of an entire nation as he was forced into exile as a result of the communist chinese invasion and occupation of tibet and he continued to tackle difficult problems on a daily basisstruggling to preserve his cultural heritage fighting for the freedom of his people for the human rights of all people and often without success yet since the age of six he had been engaged in the training of his mind learning how to remain happy despite lifes unavoidable adversities it seems to have paid off so he reminds us that if we can change some of the external conditions at the workplace that contribute to our dissatisfaction we certainly should if not although it is always easy or quick it is still possible to be happy at work through reshaping our attitudes and outlook through inner training
