 one at the stroke of eleven on a cool april night a woman named joey perrone went overboard from a luxury deck of the cruise liner mv sun duchess plunging toward the dark atlantic joey was too dumbfounded to panic i married an asshole she thought knifing headfirst into the waves the impact tore off her silk skirt blouse panties wristwatch and sandals but joey remained conscious and alert of course she did she had been cocaptain of her college swim team a biographical nugget that her husband obviously had forgotten bobbing in its fizzy wake joey watched the gaily lit sun duchess continue steaming away at twenty nautical miles per hour evidently only one of the other 2049 passengers was aware of what had happened and he wasn8217t telling anybody bastard joey thought she noticed that her bra was down around her waist and she wriggled free of it to the west under a canopy of soft amber light the coast of florida was visible joey began to swim the water of the gulf stream was slightly warmer than the air but a brisk northeasterly wind had kicked up a messy and uncomfortable chop joey paced herself to keep her mind off sharks she replayed the noteworthy events of the weeklong cruise which had begun almost as unpromisingly as it had ended the sun duchess had departed port everglades three hours late because a raccoon had turned up berserk in the pastry kitchen one of the chefs had wrestled the frothing critter into a sixtygallon tin of guava custard before it had shredded the man8217s jowls and humped snarling to the depths of the ship a capture team from broward animal control had arrived along with health inspectors and paramedics evacuated passengers were appeased with rum drinks and canap233s later while reboarding joey had passed the animal control officers trudging emptyhanded down the gangplank 8220i bet they couldn8217t catch it8221 she8217d whispered to her husband despite the inconvenience caused by the raccoon she8217d found herself rooting for the addled little varmint 8220rabies8221 her husband had said knowingly 8220damn thing lays a claw on me i8217ll own this frigging cruise line8221 8220oh please chaz8221 8220from then on you can call me onassis think i8217m kidding8221 the sun duchess was 855 feet long and weighed a shade more than seventy thousand tons joey had learned this from a brochure she8217d found in their stateroom the itinerary included puerto rico nassau and a private bahamian island that the cruise lines had purchased rumor had it from the widow of a dismembered heroin trafficker the last port of call before the ship returned to fort lauderdale was to be key west chaz had selected the cruise himself claiming it was a present for their wedding anniversary the first evening he8217d spent on the fantail slicing golf balls into the ocean initially joey had been annoyed that the sun duchess would offer a driving range much less a fake rockclimbing wall and squash courts she and chaz could have stayed in boca and done all that no less preposterous was the ship8217s tanning parlor which received heavy traffic whenever the skies turned overcast the cruise company wanted every passenger to return home with either a bronze glow or a crimson burn proof of their seven days in the tropics as it turned out joey wound up scaling the rock wall and tak ing full advantage of the other amenities even the twolane bowling alley the alternative was to eat and drink herself sick gluttony being the principal recreation aboard cruise liners the sun duchess was renowned for its twentyfourhour surfandturf buffets and that8217s how joey8217s husband had spent the hours between ports pig she thought submerging to shed a clot of seaweed that had wrapped around her neck like a sodden yule garland each day8217s sunrise had brought a glistening new harbor yet the towns and straw markets were drearily similar as if designed and operated by a franchise joey had earnestly tried to be charmed by the native wares though many appeared to have been crafted in singapore or south korea and what would one do with a helmet conch clumsily retouched with nail polish or a coconut husk bearing a handpainted likeness of prince harry so grinding was the role of tourist that joey had found herself looking forward to visiting the ship8217s 8220unspoiled private island8221 as it had been touted in the brochure yet that too proved dispiriting the cruise line had mendaciously renamed the place rapture key while making only a minimal effort at restoration roosters goats and feral hogs were the predominant fauna having outlasted the smuggler who had been raising them for banquet fare the island8217s sugardough flats were pocked with hulks of sunken drug planes and the only shells to be found along the treeshorn beach were of the 45caliber variety 8220i8217m gonna rent a jet ski8221 chaz had cheerily decreed 8220i8217ll try to find some shade8221 joey had said 8220and finish my book8221 the distance between them remained wide and unexplored by the time the sun duchess had reached key west joey and chaz were spending only about one waking hour a day together an interval usually devoted to either sex or an argument it was pretty much the same schedule they kept at home so much for the romantic latitudes joey had thought wishing she felt sadder than she did when her husband had scampered off to 8220check out the action8221 at mallory square she briefly considered seducing one of the cabin attendants a fine peruvian brute named tico ultimately joey had lost the urge dismissing the crestfallen young fellow with a peck on the chin and a fiftydollar tip she didn8217t feel strongly enough about chaz to cheat on him even out of spite although she suspected he8217d cheated on her often and quite possibly during the cruise upon returning to the sun duchess chaz had been as chatty as a cockatoo on pcp 8220see all those clouds it8217s about to rain8221 he8217d proclaimed with a peculiar note of elation 8220i guess that means no golf tonight8221 joey had said 8220hey i counted twentysix tshirt shops on duval street no wonder hemingway blew his brains out8221 8220that wasn8217t here8221 joey had informed him 8220that was in idaho8221 8220how about some chow i could eat a whale8221 at dinner chaz had kept refilling joey8217s wineglass over her protests now she understood why she felt it too that dehydrated alcohol fatigue she8217d been kicking hard up the crests of the waves and then breaststroking down the troughs but now she was losing both her rhythm and stamina this wasn8217t the heated olympic pool at ucla it was the goddamn atlantic ocean joey scrunched her eyelids to dull the saltwater burn i had a feeling he didn8217t love me anymore she thought but this is ridiculous chaz perrone listened for a splash but heard nothing except the deep lulling rumble of the ship8217s engines head cocked slightly he stood at the rail as solitary and motionless as a heron he hadn8217t planned to toss her here he had hoped to do it earlier in the voyage somewhere between nassau and san juan with the expectation that the currents would carry her body into cuban waters safely out of us jurisdiction if the bull sharks didn8217t find her first unfortunately the weather had been splendid during that early leg of the cruise and every night the outside decks were crowded with moonyeyed couples chaz8217s scheme required seclusion and he8217d nearly abandoned hope when the rain arrived three hours after leaving key west it was only a drizzle but chaz knew it would drive the tourists indoors stampeding for the lobster salad and electronic poker machines the second crucial element of his plot was surprise joey being a physically welltuned woman and chaz himself being somewhat softer and out of shape before luring her toward the stern of the sun duchess under the ruse of a starlit stroll he8217d made certain that his wife had consumed plenty of red wine four and a half glasses by his count two was usually enough to make her drowsy 8220chaz it8217s sprinkling8221 she had observed as they approached the rail naturally she8217d been puzzled knowing how her husband despised getting wet the man owned no less than seven umbrellas pretending not to hear her he had guided joey forward by the elbow 8220my stomach8217s a disaster i think it8217s time they retired that seviche don8217t you8221 8220let8217s go back inside8221 joey had suggested from a pocket of his blue blazer chaz had surreptitiously removed the key to their stateroom and let it fall to the polished planks at his feet 8220oops8221 8220chaz it8217s getting chilly out here8221 8220i think i dropped our key8221 he8217d said stooping to find it or so joey had assumed he could only guess what had shot through his wife8217s mind when she8217d felt him grab her ankles he8217s gotta be kidding is what she8217d probably thought the act itself was a rudimentary exercise in leverage really flipping her backward over the rail it had happened so fast she hadn8217t made a peep as for the splash chaz would have preferred to hear it a soft punctuation to the marriage and the crime then again it was a long way down to the water he allowed himself a brief glance but saw only whitecaps and foam in the roiling reflection of the ship8217s lights the sun duchess kept moving which was a relief no klaxons sounded chaz picked up the key and hurried to the stateroom bolting the door behind him after hanging up his blazer he opened another bottle of wine poured some into two glasses and drank half of each joey8217s suitcase lay open for repacking and chaz moved it from the bed to the floor he splayed his own travel bag and went foraging for an antacid beneath a stack of neatly folded boxers8212joey was a champion packer he had to admit8212chaz came upon a box wrapped in tartanstyle gift paper with green ribbon inside the box was a gorgeous set of leather golfclub covers that were embossed with his initials crp there was also a card 8220happy 2nd anniversary love always joey8221 admiring the silken calfskin sheaths chaz felt a knot of remorse in his gut it passed momentarily like acid reflux his wife had class no doubt about it if only she hadn8217t been so damn observant in exactly six hours he would report her missing chaz stripped to his underwear and lobbed his clothes in a corner packed inside his carryon was a paperback edition of madame bovary which he opened randomly and placed for effect on the nightstand by joey8217s side of the bed then charles regis perrone set his alarm clock laid his head on the pillow and went to sleep the gulf stream carried joey northward at almost four knots she knew she8217d have to swim harder if she didn8217t want to end up bloated and rotting on some sandbar in north carolina but lord she was tired had to be the wine chaz knew she wasn8217t much of a drinker and obviously he8217d planned it all in advance probably hoped that the fall from the ship would break her legs or knock her unconscious and if it didn8217t so what she8217d be miles from land in a pitching black ocean and scared shitless nobody would find her even if they went looking and she8217d drown from exhaustion before daylight that8217s what chaz probably figured he hadn8217t forgotten about her glory days at ucla either joey realized he knew she would start swimming if she somehow survived the fall in fact he was counting on her to swim betting that his stubborn and prideful wife would wear herself out when she should have tucked into a floating position and conserved her strength until sunrise at least then she8217d have a speck of a chance to be seen by a passing ship sometimes i wonder about myself joey thought once a tanker passed so close that it blocked out the moon the ship8217s silhouette was squat and dark and squared at both ends like a highrise condo tipped on its side joey had hollered and waved but there was no chance of being heard above the clatter of the engines the tanker pushed by a russet wall of noise and fumes and joey resumed swimming soon her legs started going numb a spidery tingle that began in her toes and crept upward muscle cramps wouldn8217t have surprised her but the slow deadening did she found herself laboring to keep her face above the waves and eventually she sensed that she8217d stopped kicking altogether toward the end she switched to the breaststroke her legs trailing like pale broken cables we8217ve only been married two years she was thinking what did i do to deserve this to take her mind off dying joey composed a mental list of the things that chaz didn8217t like about her 1 she tended to overcook fowl particularly chicken due to a lifelong fear of salmonella 2 the facial moisturizing cream that she applied at night smelled vaguely like insecticide 3 sometimes she dozed off during hockey games even the playoffs 4 she refused to go down on him while he was driving on interstate 95 the sunshine state parkway or any surface road where the posted speed limit exceeded fifty miles per hour 5 she could whip him at tennis whenever she felt like it 6 she occasionally 8220misplaced8221 his favorite george thorogood cds 7 she declined to entertain the possibility of inviting his hairstylist over for a threesome 8 she belonged to a weekly book group 9 she had more money than he did 10 she brushed with baking soda instead of toothpaste come on joey thought a guy doesn8217t suddenly decide to murder his wife just because she serves a chewy cornish hen maybe it8217s another woman joey thought but then why not just ask me for a divorce she didn8217t have the energy to sort it all out she8217d married a worthless horndog and now he8217d heaved her overboard on their anniversary cruise and very soon she would drown and be devoured by sharks out here you had the big boys blacktips lemons hammerheads tigers makos and bulls please god don8217t let them eat me joey thought until after i8217ve died the same warm tingle was starting in her fingertips and soon she knew both arms would be as spent and useless as her legs her lips had gone raw from the salt her tongue was swollen like a kielbasa and her eyelids were puffy and crusted still the lights of florida beckoned like stardust whenever she reached the top of a wave so joey struggled on believing she still had a slender chance of survival if she made it across the gulf stream she8217d finally be able to rest ball up and float until the sun came up she had momentarily forgotten about the sharks when something heavy and roughskinned butted against her left breast thrashing and grunting she beat at the thing with both fists until the last of her strength was gone cavitating into unconsciousness she was subjected to a flash vision of chaz in their stateroom aboard the sun duchess screwing a blond croupier before heading aft for one final bucket of balls prick joey thought then the screen in her head went blank
