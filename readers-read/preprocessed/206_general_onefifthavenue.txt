 it was only a part in a tv series and only a onebedroom apartment in new york but parts of any kind much less decent ones were hard to come by and even in los angeles everyone knew the value of a pied224terre in manhattan and the script arrived on the same day as the final divorce papers if real life were a script a movie executive would have stricken this fact as too coincidental but schiffer diamond loved coincidences and signs loved the childlike magic of believing all things happened for a reason she was an actress and had lived on magic nearly all her life and so she took the part which required moving back to new york city for six months where she would stay in the onebedroom apartment she owned on fifth avenue her initial plan was to stay in new york for the duration of the shoot and then return to la and her house in los feliz two days after she took the part she went to the ivy and ran into her most recent exhusband lunching with a young woman he was seated at a table in the center of the room reveling in his new status as the president of a network and given the deference the staff showed the young woman schiffer understood the young woman to be his new girlfriend she was rumored to be a concert pianist from a renowned family but had the glossy appearance of an expensive prostitute the relationship was a clich233 but twentyfive years in hollywood had taught schiffer that men never minded clich233s especially when the clich233 concerned the penis shortly thereafter when she handed her ticket to the valet and stood outside the restaurant in her sunglasses she decided to sell the house in los feliz make a clean break of it and move back to one fifth schiffer diamond has taken a part in a tv series enid merle said to her nephew philip oakland she must be desperate philip said halfjokingly enid and philip occupied two of the second best apartments in one fifth located on the thirteenth floor with adjoining terraces separated by a charming white picket fence it was across this fence that enid now spoke to her nephew it may be a very good part enid countered consulting the piece of paper she held in her hand shes going to play a mother superior who leaves the church to become the editor in chief of a magazine for teenagers now theres a believable concept philip said with the sarcasm he reserved for most matters hollywood about as believable as a giant reptile that terrorizes new york i wish youd quit screenplays and go back to writing serious novels enid said cant philip said with a smile im desperate it may be based on a true story enid continued there was a woman8212sandra miles8212who was a mother superior and became an editor in chief back in the seventies i had her to dinner once or twice a thoroughly miserable woman but that may have been due to her husbands cheating being a virgin for so long its possible she never got the sex part right in any case enid added the series shoots in new york uhhuh philip said i suppose well be seeing her around the building again enid said who philip said trying to appear uninterested sandra miles schiffer diamond enid said sandra miles left new york years ago she may even be dead unless she stays in a hotel philip said referring to schiffer diamond why on earth would she do that enid said when his aunt had gone back in philip remained on his terrace staring out at washington square park of which he had a superior view it was july and the park was lush with greenery the dry august heat yet to come but philip wasnt thinking about foliage he was miles away standing on a dock on catalina island twentyfive years before so youre the schoolboy genius schiffer diamond said coming up behind him huh he said turning around they tell me youre the writer of this lousy movie he bristled if you think its so lousy8212 yes schoolboy she asked then why are you in it all movies are lousy by definition theyre not art but everyone needs money even geniuses im not doing it for the money he said why are you doing it to meet girls like you he asked she laughed she was wearing white jeans and a navy blue tshirt she was braless and barefoot and tanned good answer schoolboy she said starting to walk away hey he called after her do you really think the movie is lousy what do you think she asked besides you can never really judge a mans work until youve been to bed with him are you planning to go to bed with me he said i never plan anything i like to see what happens lifes much more interesting that way dont you think and she went to do her scene a minute later enids voice startled philip out of his reverie i just talked to roberto she said referring to the head doorman schiffer diamond is coming back today a housekeeper was in her apartment this week getting it ready roberto says shes moving back maybe permanently isnt that exciting im thrilled philip said i wonder how shell find new york enid said having been away for so long exactly the same auntie philip said you know new york never changes the characters are different but the play remains the same later that afternoon enid merle was putting the finishing touches on her daily gossip column when a sudden gust of wind slammed shut the door to her terrace crossing the room to open it enid caught sight of the sky and stepped outside a mountain of thunderclouds had built up on the other side of the hudson river and was rapidly approaching the city this was unusual enid thought as the early july day hadnt been particularly hot gazing upward enid spotted her neighbor mrs louise houghton on her own terrace wearing an old straw hat and holding a pair of gardening shears in her gloved hand in the last five years louise houghton who was nearing one hundred had slowed down spending most of her time attending to her prizewinning roses hallo enid called loudly to mrs houghton who was known to be slightly deaf looks like were in for a big thunderstorm thank you dear mrs houghton said graciously as if she were a queen addressing one of her loyal subjects enid would have been annoyed if not for the fact that this was mrs houghtons standard response to just about everyone now you might want to go inside enid said despite mrs houghtons quaint grandeur which was offputting to some enid was fond of the old lady the two having been neighbors for over sixty years thank you dear mrs houghton said again and might have gone inside but for a flock of pigeons that flew abruptly out of washington square park diverting her attention in the next second the sky turned black and rain the size of pellets began to pummel fifth avenue enid hurried inside losing sight of mrs houghton who was struggling against the rain on her spindly old legs another strong gust of wind released a lattice screen from its moorings and knocked the elegant old lady to her knees lacking the strength to stand louise houghton tipped sideways onto her hip shattering the fragile bone and preventing further movement for several minutes she lay in the rain until one of her four maids unable to locate mrs houghton in the vast seventhousandsquarefoot apartment ventured outside and discovered her under the lattice meanwhile on the street below two town cars were slowly making their way down fifth avenue like a small cortege when they reached one fifth the drivers got out and hunched against the rain and shouting instructions and oaths began pulling out the luggage the first piece was an oldfashioned louis vuitton steamer trunk that required the efforts of two men to lift roberto the doorman hurried out paused under the awning and called for backup before waving the men inside a porter came up from the basement pushing a large cart with brass poles the drivers heaved the trunk onto the cart and then one after another each piece of matching luggage was piled on top
