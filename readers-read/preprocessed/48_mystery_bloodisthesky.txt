 nbspnbspnbspnbsp i saw a lot of fires when i was a cop in detroit i was supposed to help secure the scene and then get the hell out of the way but sometimes id stick around and watch the firefighters doing their work i saw some real battles but when they were done the building would always still be standing that was the thing that got to me the windows would be blown out and maybe thered be a big hole in the roof but the building would still be there nbspnbspnbspnbsp years later i watched a lake superior storm taking down a boathouse when the storm let up there was nothing left but a concrete slab covered with sand it wasnt surprising anyone who lives up here knows that water is stronger than fire water wins that one going away but at least water cleans up after itself it does the job all the way when water destroys it makes everything look new it can even be beautiful nbspnbspnbspnbsp fire doesnt do that when a fire is done whats left is only half destroyed it is charred and brittle it is obscene there is nothing so ugly in all the world as what a fire leaves behind covered in ashes and smoke and a smell youll think about every day for the rest of your lifenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats why i had to start rebuilding the cabin maybe i was fooling myself but it was something i had to do even though the days were getting shorter even though the pine trees were bending in the cold october wind no man in his right mind would have started rebuilding then so of course i didnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had already taken away most of the old wood those logs that would have lasted another three hundred years if they hadnt burned i had hauled them away along with the pipes burned black and the bed frames twisted by the heat there was nothing now but the stone foundation stripped of the wooden floor and the chimney the last thing my father had made with his bare hands before he died i knew that the snow would come and it would cover the black stains on the ground and the chimney would stand alone in the cold silence like a grave marker i wasnt going to let that happen nbspnbspnbspnbsp the rebuilding didnt start well the man who said hed be there on monday with my white pine logs rolled up on wednesday morning acting like he had nothing to apologize for he had one of those long flatbeds with the crane on it with enough lifting power to set every last log down as gently as a tea cup but it took him all morning to clear the truck and he damn near knocked over the chimney in the process then he stood around for a while trying to tell me about his own cabin down in traverse city the cabins i passed on the way in he finally said you built those nbspnbspnbspnbsp my father did nbspnbspnbspnbsp looks like you had a big one here he said he hitched his pants up as he looked around the clearing what happened did it burn down nbspnbspnbspnbsp it did nbspnbspnbspnbsp hell of a thing he said you gotta be careful with those wood stoves nbspnbspnbspnbsp i cant argue with that nbspnbspnbspnbsp looks like you learned the hard way nbspnbspnbspnbsp i let a few seconds tick by it wasnt a wood stove i finally said somebody burned it down nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre shittin me nbspnbspnbspnbsp this gentleman and i we had a little disagreement nbspnbspnbspnbsp it took a moment for that one to sink in are you shittin me man you gotta be shittin me nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont have to believe it nbspnbspnbspnbsp i suppose youre gonna rebuild this all by yourself too nbspnbspnbspnbsp im gonna try nbspnbspnbspnbsp seriously wheres all your help at nbspnbspnbspnbsp if i need help ill get it nbspnbspnbspnbsp its october he said youre not thinking of starting this now are you nbspnbspnbspnbsp id have to be crazy you mean nbspnbspnbspnbsp is what im saying yeah unless youre just shittin me some more nbspnbspnbspnbsp well i appreciate your concern i said and i appreciate you bringing up my logs you were only two days late have a good trip back home nbspnbspnbspnbsp he was still shaking his head as he drove away i listened to the distant sound of his truck as he rumbled onto the main road and headed south when he was gone there was nothing left to hear but a steady wind coming off the lakenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp well pops i said to the wind lets see if i remember how to do this nbspnbspnbspnbsp this was the cabin he had built in the summers of 80 and 81 i helped him for a few weeks in that second year i was already out of baseball and working as a police officer in detroit and this was my last attempt to make peace with him the days were hot i remember that and as i helped him peel and scribe the logs it brought back yet another summer back in 1968 the first time i had ever been up here in paradise michigan i was only seventeen then with one more year of school ahead of me before heading off to single a ball in sarasota he wanted me to go to college but i had my own ideas thirteen years later he finished this cabin his biggest and best his masterpiece six months after that he was dead nbspnbspnbspnbsp the cabin may have burned to the ground but at least we had those summersnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp twenty years later on a cold october day i started all over again i cut the sill logs first the logs that would run along the bottom of each wall then secured them to the foundation with jbolts i cut a groove along the outside edge with the chain saw just like he had taught me when it rained the water would collect in the groove and drip away instead of running down the foundation then i cut the grooves for the floor joists i put rough plywood down for the time being id put the nice hardwood floor boards down when the outside was finished nbspnbspnbspnbsp that was the first daynbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp when the light was gone i went down to the glasgow inn for dinner my friend jackie owns the place if you ever find yourself in paradise just go to the one blinking light in the center of town then go north another hundred yards or so itll be there on the right when you step into the place you wont see a typical american bar there are no mirrors to stare into while you drink no smoky dark corners to nurse a bad mood in the chairs are comfortable theres a fire going in the hearth every night regardless of the weather and theres a man there named jackie connery who looks like an old scottish golf caddie if you ask him the right way jackie will even risk his liquor license and give you a cold canadian beer nbspnbspnbspnbsp i take that last part back those canadian beers are just for me nbspnbspnbspnbsp i felt like hell the next morning my hands were sore my arms were sore my legs were sore and my back was sore aside from that i was fine nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had my coffee and looked up at the dark clouds rain was the last thing i needed because today was the day id start building the wallsnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp i scribed each log the way my father had done i did most of the heavy cutting with the chain saw stopping every halfhour to sharpen it i used an ax to cut the notches keeping both hands together as i swung it like a baseball bat that much he didnt have to teach me you cant be accurate with your hands apart nbspnbspnbspnbsp of course cutting the scarf just right is the hard part or as the old man liked to say this is where you separated the men from the boys the idea is to cut it so perfectly that one log will rest on top of the other with no daylight in between if you do it right you dont need any chinking if you dont do it right then god help you youve got no business building a cabin in the first place nbspnbspnbspnbsp the first log i tried cutting that morning i didnt get right the second log was worse the third log you could have put in a carnival and charged people five dollars a head to come laugh at itnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp the wind picked up it looked like rain was coming i kept working i was halfway through the fourth log when the hornets attacked me nbspnbspnbspnbsp the nest was hanging from one of the birch trees they had already been smoked out the night of the fire the nest partially caved in by the spray of the fire hoses they were trying to rebuild just like i was but they had run out of time now halfcrazed by the cold weather most of them near the end of their natural lives they saw me moving around below them rattling around with my chain saw they decided to go down fighting nbspnbspnbspnbsp i slapped two off the back of my neck another off my arm crazy fucking things get away from me the next one caught me right on the cheek and that was it for me the day was already going bad enough nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had my extension ladder there figuring id need it eventually so i braced it up against the birch tree and climbed up with my ax i was just about to swing at the branch i was going to take the whole thing down with one good whack and then i was going to soak the nest with gasoline and set it on fire knowing me i would have emptied the can a full two gallons of gasoline and then i would have thrown a lit match right in the middle of it all the leaves on the ground would have gone up at once and id be running around with my pants on fire and both eyebrows singed right off my face nbspnbspnbspnbsp i stopped myself just in timenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp i took a deep breath and climbed back down the ladder i dropped the axnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp it wasnt worth it watching the nest burn sending the rest of those hornets to hell theyd all be dead in another week anyway nbspnbspnbspnbsp it was a lesson i had taken most of my life to learn sometimes you have to let things go nbspnbspnbspnbsp the rain came the dark clouds stayed in the sky i went back to work nbspnbspnbspnbsp i had come back up here in 1987 my marriage was over and i was off the police force with a dead partner in the ground and a bullet in my chest i came up here intending to sell off the land and the six cabins my father had built but i didnt do it somehow the upper peninsula was just what i needed it was cold and unforgiving even in the heart of summer there was a terrible beauty to the place and i could be alone up here in a part of the world where being alone was the rule and not the exception i moved into the first cabin the cabin i had helped him build myself back when i was seventeen years old i stayed up here and lived day to day and never thought id have to face my past again nbspnbspnbspnbsp that didnt work it never doesnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp hours after i called it a day i could still feel the buzz of the chain saw in my hands there was a deep ache in my shoulder right where they had taken the other two bullets outnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp what was it this time jackie said he slid a cold canadian my way nbspnbspnbspnbsp he was talking about my face of course there was a nice little swollen knot under my eye whenever something goes wrong i end up wearing it on my face nbspnbspnbspnbsp hornets i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp hows the cabin going nbspnbspnbspnbsp its a little slow nbspnbspnbspnbsp he nodded his head he didnt say a word about how late it was in the season or how much of a fool i was jackie understood why i needed to do this nbspnbspnbspnbsp you know who could help you he said nbspnbspnbspnbsp i knew i took a long pull off the bottle and then set it back down on the bar ive got to get some sleep i said then i leftnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp i was just as sore the next morning but somehow everything felt different it was all coming back to me the way you let the chain saw and the ax do the work the way you work with the grain of the log instead of fighting against it the logs starting fitting together the way they were supposed to i had the walls two logs high by lunchtime of course that meant it was getting harder and harder to wrestle the logs into position id have to start using the ramps soon and eventually id have to set up some kind of sky line that would slow me downnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp hell maybe jackie was right there was one man who could really help me	but id be damned if i was going to go ask him nbspnbspnbspnbsp my father bought all the land on both sides of this old logging road nearly a hundred acres in all he built the six cabins and lived in each one of them off and on over the years renting out the others to tourists in the summer hunters in the fall and snowmobilers in the winter when i came up here and moved into the first cabin i kept renting out the rest of them it was a good way to stay busy without having to go anywherenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp a few years after i moved in somebody bought the couple of acres between my fathers land and the main road i was a little worried about what the new owner might do to that land i had visions of a tripledecker summer home with every tree knocked down so they could maybe get a view of the lake but it didnt happen that way it was one man and i watched him build his own cabin by hand if my father had been around to see it he would have approved of this mans work nbspnbspnbspnbsp i got to know him eventually you dont live on the same road up here with one other person without running into each other id plow the road for him hed give me some of the venison from his hunts he didnt drink so we never did that together but we did share an adventure or two i even played in goal one night for his hockey team the fact that he was an ojibwa indian never got in the way of our friendshipnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp until one day he had to make a choice nbspnbspnbspnbsp i didnt hear his truck pull up with the chain saw roaring away i wouldnt have heard a tank battalion i happened to glance at the road and saw his truck parked there vinnie red sky leblanc was standing next to it watching me he was wearing his denim jacket with the fur around the collar i had no idea how long hed been there nbspnbspnbspnbsp i shut the chain saw down and wiped my forehead with my sleeve nbspnbspnbspnbsp youre gonna go deaf he said wheres your ear protection nbspnbspnbspnbsp i left them around here someplace just cant find them nbspnbspnbspnbsp he shook his head at that then walked right past me to the stacks of logs like many bay mills ojibwa you had to look twice to see the indian in him there was a little extra width to his high cheekbones and a certain calmness in his eyes when he looked at you you always got the feeling he was thinking carefully about what to say before he said it nbspnbspnbspnbsp white pine he said nbspnbspnbspnbsp of course nbspnbspnbspnbsp whered it come from nbspnbspnbspnbsp place down near traverse city nbspnbspnbspnbsp i thought i saw a truck going by he said that was what wednesday nbspnbspnbspnbsp he was supposed to be here monday nbspnbspnbspnbsp couple of these logs i wouldnt use on a doghouse he said like this one right here nbspnbspnbspnbsp i know i was gonna put that one aside nbspnbspnbspnbsp he slipped his hands under the log and lifted it he was maybe three inches shorter than me and thirty pounds lighter but i wouldnt have wanted to fight the man on the ice or off he carried the log a few steps and tossed it in the brush nbspnbspnbspnbsp thatll be your waste pile he said i see another one right down here nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont have to do that vinnie i know which ones are bad he went over to the cabin knelt down and ran his hand along one of the logs you know which ones are bad he said and yet this one right here seems to be part of your wall already nbspnbspnbspnbsp when did you become the county inspector i said i didnt see it in the newspaper nbspnbspnbspnbsp he let that one go can i ask why youre doing this by yourself nbspnbspnbspnbsp my father did it by himself nbspnbspnbspnbsp did he start building in october nbspnbspnbspnbsp i know im not going to finish it i said i just had to start i couldnt wait until spring nbspnbspnbspnbsp he smiled at me as he stood up patience was never your strong suit nbspnbspnbspnbsp vinnie you always loved this cabin you told me once youd buy it off me for a million dollars you remember nbspnbspnbspnbsp i do he said this was the best cabin ive ever seen nbspnbspnbspnbsp put yourself in my place i said if somebody burned this down what would you do nbspnbspnbspnbsp first of all id kill whoever did it he thought about it for a moment did you kill him nbspnbspnbspnbsp no i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp but hes dead nbspnbspnbspnbsp yes nbspnbspnbspnbsp okay then the next thing id do is rebuild the thing as close as i could to the original nbspnbspnbspnbsp exactly nbspnbspnbspnbsp but i wouldnt do it alone he said not with a friend down the road who knows twice as much about building cabins as i do nbspnbspnbspnbsp excuse me twice as much since when nbspnbspnbspnbsp make that three times as much i was trying to be kind nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah well if youll excuse me ive got work to do nbspnbspnbspnbsp youll never even get to the roof he said you want the snow to pile up in here all winter nbspnbspnbspnbsp what are you saying you really want to help me nbspnbspnbspnbsp your fathers spirit sent me he said he knows what this thing would look like if you did it yourself nbspnbspnbspnbsp ah indian humor i said ive really been missing that nbspnbspnbspnbsp let me go get my stuff he said ill see if i have an extra pair of earphones too nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah get me those earphones i said i have a feeling ill be needing them now nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats how i got my help thats how we started being friends again we worked until the sun went down i offered to buy him dinner at the glasgow but he took a pass he said he was going over to the reservation to see his mother the next morning he was on the site before i was he was spotpeeling logs with his drawknife nbspnbspnbspnbsp let me ask you something i said when i pulled up arent you supposed to be out in the woods this month vinnies regular job was dealing blackjack over at the bay mills casino but every fall hed make extra money working as a guide for hunters nbspnbspnbspnbsp id rather be doing this he said nbspnbspnbspnbsp and your day job i said youre still dealing right nbspnbspnbspnbsp i asked for some time off nbspnbspnbspnbsp vinnie you dont have to do this nbspnbspnbspnbsp i needed a break anyway alex okay dont worry about it just help me peel these things nbspnbspnbspnbsp those are already peeled vinnie nbspnbspnbspnbsp by what a machine here let me show you the right way to do it somehow i managed not to kill him that day when we got to work we found a good rhythm and added three more rows to the walls we didnt talk much about anything except what log came next and where it should go there was not a word said about what had happened between us when we had run out of daylight i invited him to have dinner at the glasgow again he seemed to hesitate for a second before saying yes if youve got a hot date or something just tell me i said i wont be offended nbspnbspnbspnbsp ive been over on the rez a lot lately he said they can do without me for one night nbspnbspnbspnbsp there was a whole story behind that one vinnie moving off the bay mills reservation and buying his own land i knew it didnt sit well with the rest of his family even though he made a point of spending most of his free time there nbspnbspnbspnbsp come on i said ill buy you a steak nbspnbspnbspnbsp jackie did a doubletake when we walked into the glasgow together well look at this he said nbspnbspnbspnbsp two steaks i said medium rare you know the rest nbspnbspnbspnbsp good evening to you too he said im just fine thanks for asking if he was genuinely mad at me it didnt stop him from opening a cold canadian and sliding it my waynbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp its good to see you vinnie said its been a while nbspnbspnbspnbsp dont tell me jackie said youre showing alex how to build his cabin am i right nbspnbspnbspnbsp quotit was too painful to watch vinnie said i had to step in nbspnbspnbspnbsp you guys are hilarious i said just keep it up nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats the way it went on a cold october night it had been another cold night not that long ago when the woman had come to me she was an ojibwa someone vinnie knew someone he had grown up with on the reservation she was in trouble and i did what i could to help her in the end vinnie was involved and thats when he had to make his choice whether to trust me or his own people i had no good reason to blame him but the choice hurt me just the same and it had stayed there between us ever sincenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp until this night we sat by the fire and talked about the cabin and what we would work on the next day we pretended that nothing had ever changed maybe thats how you get past it you pretend until its real nbspnbspnbspnbsp he was there to help me the next day the day after that and then the next i bought him dinner every night hell it was the least i could do we were putting those walls up so fast we actually had a shot at getting the roof on before it snowed thats what i thought anyway and then of course it did snow it wasnt much just a few flurries overnight that turned to rain in the morning but it was enough to knock us out of the game for the rest of the day vinnie ran off to do something on the rez and i checked on the renters in the other cabins it was bow season in michigan so i had all the usual men from downstate the men who appreciated the fact that my land was right next to the state land and that id leave them a cord of firewood outside their door and otherwise leave them alone bow season was easy because bow hunters are the true gentlemen of the sport they dont make a racket and they keep the cabins clean firearm hunters were usually okay although id still get my share of drunken clownsnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp snowmobilers of course were the worst of all just one more reason to dread the winter and to hope like hell that the snow wasnt coming for goodnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp it wasnt not yet anyway the next morning the sun came out and melted away the thin traces of snow on the ground when i got to the cabin site i was surprised to see he wasnt there yet an hour later i started wondering i was doing as much of the work as i could on my own but it was getting harder and harder to set the logs without vinnie to help me id have to set up the sky line of course i wasnt even paying him so what right did i have to complain nbspnbspnbspnbsp by lunchtime i thought id head down the road and check on him his truck was gone i couldnt help but think of another day when i had sat in this exact same spot looking at his empty driveway wondering where he was it turned out he had spent the night in jail having taken a hockey stick to the face of a sault ste marie police officer that was the beginning of a very bad weeknbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp good god vinnie i said to myself i hope to hell you werent out finding trouble last night nbspnbspnbspnbsp i went down to the glasgow for some of jackies beef stew and a canadian wheres your man jackie said as he served me nbspnbspnbspnbsp you got me he didnt show up today nbspnbspnbspnbsp he gave me a look whattsa matter trouble in paradise nbspnbspnbspnbsp no trouble i just dont know where he is nbspnbspnbspnbsp last time you ended up in the hospital nbspnbspnbspnbsp jackie hes been helping me all week okay dont you think he deserves a day off nbspnbspnbspnbsp if thats all it is fine he said im just saying the last time vinnie got in trouble youre the one who ended up almost getting killed nbspnbspnbspnbsp okay i hear you nbspnbspnbspnbsp okay then okay vinnie walked in just then and saved us he came to the bar and sat down next to me nbspnbspnbspnbsp give the man some beef stew i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp no thanks he said thats when i knew something was wrong if you have any appetite at all you dont turn down jackies beef stew nbspnbspnbspnbsp whats going on i said nbspnbspnbspnbsp im sorry i wasnt around today something sort of came up nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont have to apologize i said hell its not like im paying you anything vinnie thought about it you realize he said that im the one paying you for what happened this is how im settling my debt to you nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont owe me anything i said weve been through this remember nbspnbspnbspnbsp i sure as hell didnt want to go through it again not when we both seemed to be finally getting over it nbspnbspnbspnbsp i remember he said but still nbspnbspnbspnbsp for gods sake i said are you gonna tell me whats wrong nbspnbspnbspnbsp he sat there for a long moment while jackie looked back and forth between us clearly expecting the worst nbspnbspnbspnbsp its tom he finally said nbspnbspnbspnbsp quotyour brother nbspnbspnbspnbsp yeah nbspnbspnbspnbsp i didnt know a hell of a lot about tom leblanc i knew he was a few years younger than vinnie and that he had caused his family enough trouble to make vinnie look like the golden boy there was one incident at the canadian border that vinnie never wanted to talk about i had to read about it in the soo evening news that was the last time i had seen tom in fact right before had gone off to serve his two years at kincheloenbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp whats the problem i said i knew he was out on parole now and saying all the right things about staying straight but hell if was in trouble again it wouldnt exactly shock menbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp he was on a hunting trip in ontario he was supposed to be back a couple of days ago nbspnbspnbspnbsp and he didnt make it back nbspnbspnbspnbsp no nbspnbspnbspnbsp you dont think nbspnbspnbspnbsp what that hes passed out in some bar in canada is that what you mean nbspnbspnbspnbsp vinnie come on nbspnbspnbspnbsp its different this time alex nbspnbspnbspnbsp here it comes i thought hes been going to the meetings hes a changed man the whole speech thats what i expected nbspnbspnbspnbsp thats not what i gotnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp this time vinnie said hes me
