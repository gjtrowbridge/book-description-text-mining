 one derek strange got down in a threepoint stance he breathed evenly as his father had instructed him to do and took in the pleasant smell of april magnolias dogwoods and cherry trees were in bloom around the city the scent of their flowers and the heavy fragrance of a nearby lilac bush growing against a residential fence filled the air you keep your back straight said derek like youre gonna set a dinner up on it you aint want your butt up in the air either that way youre ready you just blow right out like and hit the holes bust on through derek and his saturday companion billy georgelakos were in an alley that ran behind the threestar diner on a singlenumber block of kennedy street at the eastern edge of northwest dc both were twelve years old like your man said billy sitting on a milk crate an our army at war comic book rolled tightly in his meaty hand yeah said derek here go jim brown right here derek came up out of his stance and exploded forward one palm hovering above the other both close to his chest he took an imaginary handoff as he ran a few steps then cut slowed down turned and walked back toward billy derek had a way of moving it was confident but not cocky shoulders squared with a slight looseness to the hips he had copied the walk from his older brother dennis derek was the right height for his age but like all boys and most men he wished to be taller lately at night when he was in bed he thought he could feel himself growing the mirror over his mothers dresser told him he was filling out in the upper body too billy despite his wide shoulders and unusually broad chest was not an athlete he kept up on the local sports teams but he had other passions billy liked pinball machines cap pistols and comic books that how brown got his twelve yards in eleven carries against the skins said billy uhuh billy dont be talkin about that don bosseler gained more in that game than brown did in that game most of the time bosseler aint fit to carry my mans cleats two weeks before that at griffith jim brown ran for one hundred and fiftytwo the man set the alltime rushing record in that one billy don bosseler shoot awright said billy a smile forming on his wide face your man can play derek knew billy was messing with him but he couldnt help getting agitated just the same not that derek wasnt a redskins fan he listened to every game on the radio he read the shirley povich and bob addie columns in the post whenever they saw print he followed the stats of quarterback eddie lebaron middle linebacker chuck drazenovich halfback eddie sutton and others he even tracked bosselers yardspercarry in fact he only rooted against the skins twice a year and then with a pang of guilt when they played cleveland derek had a newspaper photo of brown taped to the wall of the bedroom he shared with his brother with the exception of his father there was no one who was more of a hero to him than brown this was a strong individual who commanded respect not just from his own but from people of all colors the man could play don bosseler said derek chuckling he put one big longfingered hand to the top of his head shaved nearly to the scalp and rubbed it it was something his brother dennis did in conversation when he was cracking on his friends derek had picked up the gesture like his walk from dennis im kiddin you derek billy got up off the milk crate and put his comic book down on the diners back stoop cmon lets go where my neighborhood maybe theres a game up at fort stevens okay said derek billys streets were a couple of miles from the diner and several miles from dereks home most of the kids up there were white but derek didnt object truth was it excited him some to be off his turf on most saturdays derek and billy spent their time out in the city while their fathers worked at the diner they were boys and were expected to go out and find adventure and even mild forms of trouble there was violence in certain sections of the district but it was committed by adults and usually among criminals and mostly at night generally the young went untouched out on the main drag derek noticed that the local movie house the kennedy was still running buchanan rides alone with randolph scott derek had already seen it with his dad his father had promised to take him down to u street for the new john wayne rio bravo which had people talking around town the picture was playing down at the republic like the other district theaters on u the lincoln and the booker t the republic was mostly for colored and derek felt comfortable there his father darius strange loved westerns and derek strange had come to love them too derek and billy walked east on the commercial strip they passed two boys derek knew from church and one of them said what you hangin with that white boy for and derek said what business is that of yours he made just enough eye contact for the boy to know he was serious and all of them went on their way billy was dereks first and only white playmate the working relationship between their fathers had caused their hookup otherwise they never would have been put together since most of the time outside of sporting events and first jobs colored boys and white boys didnt mix wasnt anything wrong with mixing exactly but it just seemed more natural to be with your own kind hanging with billy sometimes put derek in a bad position youd get challenged out here when your own saw you walking with a white but derek figured you had to stand by someone unless he gave you cause not to and he felt he had to say something when conflict arrived it wouldnt have been right to let it pass sure billy often said the wrong things and sometimes those things hurt but it was because he didnt know any better he was ignorant but his ignorance was never deliberate they walked northwest through manor park across the green of fort slocum and soon were up on georgia avenue which many thought of as main street dc it was the longest road in the district and had always been the primary northern thoroughfare into washington going back to when it was called the 7th street pike all types of businesses lined the strip and folks moved about the sidewalks day and night the avenue was always alive the road was white concrete and etched with streetcar tracks wood platforms where riders had once waited to board streetcars were still up in spots but the dc transit buses were now the main form of public transportation a few steel troughs used to water the horses that had pulled the carts of the junkmen and fruit and vegetable vendors remained on the avenue but in short order all of it would be going the way of those mobile merchants it was said that the street would soon be paved in asphalt and the tracks platforms and troughs would disappear billys neighborhood brightwood was mostly white working and middleclass and heavily ethnic greeks italians irish catholics and all varieties of jew the families had moved from petworth 7th street columbia heights the h street corridor in northeast and chinatown working their way north as they began to make more money in the prosperous years following world war ii they were seeking nicer housing yards for their children and driveways for their cars also they were moving away from the colored whose numbers and visibility had rapidly increased citywide in the wake of reurbanization and forced desegregation but even this would be a temporary move blockbuster real estate agents in brightwood had begun moving colored families into white streets with the intention of scaring residents into selling their houses on the cheap the next stop for uppernorthwest eastofthepark whites would be the suburbs of maryland no one knew that the events of the next nine years would hasten that final move though there was a feeling that some sort of change was coming and that it would have to come an unspoken sense of the inevitable still some denied it as strongly as they denied death derek lived in park view south of petworth now mostly colored and some workingclass whites he attended backus junior high and would go on to roosevelt high school billy went to paul junior high and was destined for coolidge high which had some coloreds most of whom were athletes many coolidge kids would go on to college far fewer from roosevelt would roosevelt had gangs coolidge had fraternities derek and billy lived a few short miles apart but the differences in their lives and prospects were striking they walked the east side of georgias 6200 block passing the open door of the arrow cleaners a business that had been in place since 1929 owned and operated by bill caludis they stopped in to say hey to caludiss son billy whom billy georgelakos knew from church on the corner sat clarks mens shop near marinoffpritt and katz the jewish market where several of the butchers had camp numbers tattooed on their forearms nearby was the sheridan theater which was running decision at sundown another randolph scott derek had seen it with his dad they crossed to the other side of georgia they walked by vinces agnes flower shop where billy paused to say a few words with a cute young clerk named margie and the sheridan waffle shop also known as johns lunch a diner owned by john deoudes then it was a watering hole called sues 6210 a chinese laundry a barbershop and on the corner another beer garden the 6200 stagger lee was playing on the house juke its rhythms coming through the 6200s open door on the sidewalk outside the bar three young white teenagers were alternately talking smoking cigarettes and running combs through their hair one of them was ribbing another asking if his girlfriend had given him his shiner and swollen face nah said the kid with the black eye i got jumped by a buncha niggers down at griffith stadium adding that he was going to be looking for them and some getback the group quieted as derek and billy passed there were no words spoken no hard stares and no trouble derek looking at the weak allmouth boy and thinking probly wasnt no buncha niggers about it only had to be one at the corner of georgia and rittenhouse billy pointed excitedly at a man wearing a brimmed hat crossing the street and heading east with him was a young woman whose face they couldnt see but whose backside moved in a pleasing way thats bo diddley said billy thought he lived over on rhode island avenue thats what everyone says but we all been seein him around here lately they say hes got a spot down there on rittenhouse bo diddleys a gunslinger said derek a warmth rising in his thighs as he checked out the fill of the womans skirt they walked south to quackenbos and cut across the lot of the nativity school a catholic convent that housed a nice gymnasium the nuns there were forever chasing billy and his friends from the gym beyond the lot was fort stevens where confederate forces had been repelled by the guns and musketry of union soldiers in july of 1864 the fort had been recreated and preserved but few tourists now visited the site the grounds mainly served as a playing field for the neighborhood boys aint nobody up here said derek looking across the weedy field the american flag flying on a white mast throwing a wavy shadow on the lawn im gonna pick some porichia for my mom said billy say what derek and billy went up a steep grade to its crest where several cannons sat spaced in a row the grade dropped to a deep gully that ran along the northern line of the fort beside one of the cannons grew patches of spindly plants with hard stems billy pulled a few of the plants and shook the dirt off the roots thought your mama liked them dandelion weeds thats rodichia these here are good too you gotta get em before they flower though cause then theyre too bitter lets go give em to her and get something to drink billy lived in a slateroofed copperguttered brick colonial on the 1300 block of somerset a few blocks west of the park in contrast with the row houses of park view and petworth the houses here were detached with flat welltended front lawns the streets were heavy with italians and greeks the deoudes family lived on somerset as did the vondas family and up on underwood lived a wiry kid named bobby boukas whose parents owned a flower shop all were members of billys church st sophia on tuckerman stood the house where midget actor johnny puleo who had played in the lancastercurtis circus picture trapeze stayed for much of the year puleo drove a customized dodge with wood blocks fitted to the gas and brake pedals on the way to the georgelakos house derek stopped to pet a muscular tan boxer who was usually chained outside the front of the deoudes residence the dogs name was greco greco sometimes walked with the police at night on their foot patrols and was known to be quick loyal and tough derek got down on his haunches and let greco smell his hand the dog pushed his muzzle into dereks fingers and derek patted his belly and rubbed behind his ears crazy said billy what you mean usually he rises up and shows his teeth to colored boys right well yeah he likes me dereks eyes softened as he admired the dog one day ima get me one just like him too
