 right from the start there was something about the investigation that made lieutenant renne kampasa uneasy the first little qualm came sliding up out of her subconscious when she saw the victim8217s loft apartment she8217d been inside loft apartments just like it a hundred times before it was the kind of plush metropolitan pad that a group of funky tsi soap characters usually lived in beautiful single people with wellpaying jobs that gave them most of the day off so they could enjoy a floor space of around five hundred square meters as they lounged around in an extravagant decor provided by overpriced interior designers the kind of scenario completely divorced from real life but full of dramatic or comic potential for the scriptwriters yet here she was a day after the guardians8217 shotgun message that denounced president elaine doi as a starflyer agent being shown into just such an apartment on the top 223oor of a refurbished factory block in daroca the capital city of arevalo the massive openplan lounge had a wide sunny balcony that looked out over the caspe river which flowed through the heart of the city like all the capitals of successful phase one space planets daroca was a rich montage of parks elegant buildings and broad streets stretching away to the horizon under the planet8217s bronzeshaded morning sunlight it glimmered with a sharp coronal hue adding to the panorama8217s graceful appeal renne shook her head in mild disbelief at the fabulous view even with the decent salary the navy paid her she could never afford the rent on this and it was currently being paid by three firstlife girls all under twentyfive one of them was showing renne and tarlo in catriona saleeb a small twentytwoyearold with long curly black hair wearing a simple green dress with strong geometric lilac stripes8211except renne knew the dress was a fon which put its price tag over a thousand earth dollars and the girl was using it as a casual housedress renne8217s ebutler printed up saleeb8217s file in her virtual vision she was a junior member of the morishi grand family working at a bank in daroca8217s large financial district her two friends were trisha marina halgarth who had a product placement job at veccdale a halgarth subsidiary that designed chic domestic systems and isabella halgarth who8217d taken a job at a contemporary art gallery in town they fitted the whole profile three bachelorettes sharing a place in the city having fun together while they waited for their true careers to launch or husbands of equal wealth and status to materialize and carry them off to a merged trust fund mansion to produce their contracted quota of children quotthis is one great place you8217ve got herequot tarlo said as they made their way into the lounge catriona turned and gave him a smile that was a lot more than simple politeness quotthanks it8217s a family place so we get it cheapquot quotplenty of wild parties huhquot her smile became teasing quotmaybequot renne shot him an exasperated look they were supposed to be on duty not hitting on potential witnesses he just grinned back perfect white teeth gleaming out of his handsome tanned face she8217d seen for herself just how successful that grin could be in the clubs and bars around paris catriona took them over to the kitchen section which was separated from the lounge by a broad marbletopped breakfast bar the kitchen was ultra173modern equipped with every convenience gadget possible all built in to swanwhite eggshaped wall modules somehow renne couldn8217t imagine it being used for much actual cooking not even by the complicatedlooking chef bots the two other girls were sitting on stools at the bar quottrisha marina halgarthquot renne asked quotthat8217s mequot one of the girls got to her feet she had a heartshaped face and light olive skin with small dark green butterflywing octattoos flowing back from each hazel eye she wore an oversize white toweling robe like defensive armor she kept clutching at the fluffy fabric pulling it tighter around her her bare feet had silver rings around each toe quotwe8217re from navy intelligencequot tarlo said quotlieutenant kampasa and i are investigating what happened to youquot quotyou mean how gullible i wasquot she snapped quoteasy babequot isabella halgarth said her arm went around trisha8217s shoulders quotthese are the good guysquot she stood to face the investigators renne found herself having to look up slightly isabella was several centimeters taller than she almost tarlo8217s height she was dressed in very tight jeans that showed off her legs her long blond hair had been gathered into a single tail that reached down to her hips it was an image of casual elegance tarlo8217s grin had broadened renne wanted to push him against a wall and shout a warning about professional conduct wagging her finger in his face for emphasis instead she did her best to ignore the mating dance appraisals going on all around her and said quoti8217ve investigated several similar cases ms halgarth in my experience the victim is rarely gullible the guardians have developed a very sophisticated operation over the yearsquot quotyearsquot catriona snorted quotand you haven8217t caught them yetquot renne kept her polite expression in place quotwe believe we are close to a resolutionquot the three girls exchanged doubtful looks trisha sat down again gripping at her robe quoti know it8217s unpleasant for youquot tarlo said quotbut if you could start by telling me the man8217s namequot his grin mellowed to sympathetic encouragement trisha gave a reluctant nod quotsure howard liangquot she smiled feebly quoti don8217t suppose that8217s his real namequot quotnoquot tarlo said quotbut that identity will have created a lot of data within daroca8217s cybersphere our forensic software teams will pull out a great many associated files we can check on the false identity information where it was inserted possibly who was involved forging it every little bit helpsquot quothow did you meetquot renne asked quotparty we get to quite a lot of themquot she glanced at her two girlfriends for support quotthis is a great cityquot isabella said quotdaroca is a wealthy planet people here have the money and time to playquot her eyes gave tarlo an amused glance quottrish and i are dynasty catriona is a grandee what can i say we8217re highly desirablequot quotwas howard liang wealthyquot renne asked quothe didn8217t have a trust fundquot trisha said then colored quotwell he said he didn8217t his family was supposed to come from velaines he said he was a couple of years out of his first rejuve i liked himquot quotwhere did he workquot quoton the commodities desk at ridgeon financial god i don8217t even know if that8217s truequot she pressed her free hand against her forehead rubbing hard quoti don8217t know how old he really was i know nothing about him at all that8217s what i hate most about this not that he stole my author certificate not that he gave me a memory wipe just being taken in like that it8217s so stupid our family security office sends us enough warnings i never thought they ap173plied to mequot quotpleasequot tarlo said quotdon8217t blame yourself these guys are very professional hell i8217d probably get taken in by them now when did you last see himquot quotthree days ago we went out for the evening i8217d been invited to the bourne club there was some event a new drama series launch we had a meal afterward then i came home i think the apartment domestic array says i got in at five in the morning i don8217t remember anything after dinner is that when they did itquot quotpossiblyquot renne said quotdid mr liang share his apartment with anyonequot quotno he lived by himself i met a couple of his friends i think they were from ridgeon we only went out for a couple of weeks enough for me to drop my guard i guessquot she shook her head angrily quoti hate this the whole commonwealth thinks i believe the president is an alien i8217ll never be able to face anyone at work again i8217ll have to go back to solidade and get my face changed and use another namequot quotthat would probably helpquot tarlo said gently quotbut before that we need to run some tests on you there8217s a medical forensic team waiting down in the lobby they can do this in a clinic or here whichever you8217re comfortable withquot quotdo it herequot trisha said quotjust get it over withquot quotof course another team will sweep his apartmentquot quotwhat do you expect to find therequot isabella asked quotwe8217ll pin down his dna of coursequot renne told her quotwho knows what else we8217ll uncover especially if they used it as their base and we8217ll pull his files from ridgeon financial8217s personnel records which i8217d like you to verify it would help to have a picture of himquot quotwon8217t he have had reprofiling by nowquot catriona asked quotyes but it8217s his background we8217ll be focusing our investigation on his past that8217s where the clues to his origin are you must understand we have to crack the whole guardian organization open it8217s the only way to bring liang to justice we8217re not pursuing him singularlyquot they spent another twenty minutes in the loft apartment taking statements from the girls then handed them over to the medical forensic team renne was halfway to the door when she stopped and gave the big lounge a thoughtful examination trisha was going into her bedroom with two of the forensic team quotwhatquot tarlo asked quotnothingquot she gave catriona and isabella a last look before leaving quotcome onquot he said in the elevator back down to the lobby quoti know you something8217s bugging youquot quotdeja vuquot quotwhatquot quoti8217ve seen this crime scene beforequot quotme too every time the guardians shotgun the unisphere the boss sends us out to have a look aroundquot quotyeah so you should have recognized it too remember minilyaquot tarlo frowned as the doors opened they walked out into the lobby quotvaguely it was four years ago but that was a bunch of guys sharing an apartmentquot quotoh so what you8217re going sexist on me it8217s different because it8217s girlsquot quotheyquot quotit was exactly the same setup tarlo and we8217ve seen the allgirls group before as wellquot quoton nzega april gallar halgarth she was part of a holiday groupquot quotbuwangwa too don8217t forgetquot quotokay so what8217s your pointquot quoti don8217t like repetition and the guardians know we8217ll catch them a whole lot easier if they stick to the same patternquot quoti don8217t see a patternquot quotit8217s not a pattern exactlyquot quotwhat thenquot quoti8217m not sure they8217re repeating their procedure that8217s not like themquot tarlo led the way out through the lobby8217s revolving doors and used his ebutler to call a city taxi over quotthe guardians don8217t have a lot of choice in this admittedly the number of dumb young halgarths in the galaxy is pretty huge but their living and social arrangements only have a finite number of permutations it8217s not the guardians who are repeating it8217s the halgarthsquot renne frowned as the taxi pulled up in front of them he was right though that wasn8217t the line she8217d been thinking along quotdo you think the halgarth security is running an entrapment operation they could have hung trisha out as baitquot quotnoquot he said heatedly quotthat8217s wrong if it was an entrapment they would have caught liang the first night he met trisha his identity history data might have stood up to a review by ridgeon financial but a specific entrapment operation run by the halgarths no wayquot quotthey must be running entrapment operations if i were the senior halgarths i8217d be goddamn furious the family was constantly targeted by the guardiansquot tarlo settled back into the taxi8217s leather seat quotthey do tend to put a fair amount of pressure on the bossquot quoti don8217t think that8217s right either if they were running an entrapment they8217d tell usquot quotwould theyquot quotall right maybe notquot she said quotbut as this wasn8217t an entrapment it8217s irrelevant anywayquot quotwe don8217t know it wasn8217t an entrapmentquot quotthey didn8217t catch liang and they haven8217t told us which they would do at this stagequot quotalternatively they8217re busy tracking liang and don8217t want to spook him by telling usquot quotthat8217s not itquot she was having trouble even looking at tarlo quotsomething is just wrong it was too neatquot quottoo neatquot the tone of disbelief in his voice made her wince quotyeah i know i know but something bothers me that loft apartment those girls it all shouted out 8216here are dumb rich kids come and rip them off8217 quot quoti don8217t get this who8217s in the wrong here the guardians or the halgarthsquot quotwell okay i don8217t suppose it could have been the halgarths unless that really was an entrapment operationquot he grinned at her quotyou8217re getting as bad as the boss when it comes to conspiracies you8217ll be blaming the starflyer nextquot quotcould doquot she gave him a weak smile quotbut i8217m still going to tell her i think something8217s odd about this onequot quotcareer suicidequot quotcome on what kind of a detective are you we8217re supposed to act on intuitive hunches don8217t you watch any cop soapsquot quotunisphere shows are for people without lives me i8217m busy in the eveningsquot quotyeahquot she said snidely quotstill putting on your navy uniform when you go around the clubsquot quoti8217m a naval officer why shouldn8217t iquot renne laughed quotgod does that really workquot quotit does if you can find girls like those threequot she sighed quotlistenquot he said quoti8217m serious what can you tell myo you had a feeling she8217ll just bawl you out big time and don8217t look to me to back you up there was nothing wrong with itquot quotthe boss appreciates the way we consider cases you know she8217s always saying we have to take a more holistic approach to crimequot quotholistic yeah not psychicquot they were still arguing about it forty minutes later when they arrived back at the paris office five uniformed navy officers were standing in a group outside paula myo8217s office quotwhat8217s happeningquot tarlo asked alic hogan quotcolumbia8217s in there with herquot the commander said he looked very uncomfortable quotchristquot renne muttered quotit8217ll be the la fiasco i was supposed to be chasing the leads from that operation this morningquot quotwe all werequot hogan said he forced his gaze away from the closed door quotdid you find anything in darocaquot renne was trying to think what to say hogan was very bythebook quotit was a standard guardians operationquot tarlo said quickly he was staring hard at renne quotwe left forensics working through the scenequot quotgood keep me updatedquot quotyes sirquot quotstandard operationquot renne said scathingly as they walked back to their desks quoti just saved your ass back therequot tarlo said quotyou can say all that kind of intuition stuff to the boss but not hogan all that little prick is interested in is checkmarks in the boxquot quotokay okayquot she grumbled paula myo walked out of her office carrying her shoulder bag and the little rabbakas plant she kept on the windowsill a redfaced rafael columbia was standing behind her dressed in his full admiral8217s uniform renne had never seen myo look so shocked it sent a cold shiver down her own spine nothing ever ruffled the boss quotgoodbyequot myo told the office at large quotand thank you for all the hard work you did for mequot quotpaulaquot tarlo gasped she gave him a small shake of her head and he fell silent renne watched paula myo walk out it was like seeing a funeral procession quotcommander hoganquot columbia said quota word pleasequot he vanished back into myo8217s office alic hogan almost ran in after him the door closed renne sat down hard quotthat didn8217t happenquot she mumbled incredulously quotthey can8217t get rid of her she is the goddamn directoratequot quotbut we8217re not the directoratequot tarlo said quietly quotnot anymorequot
