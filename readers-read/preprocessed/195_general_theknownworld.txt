 chapter one liaison the warmth of family stormy weather the evening his master died he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults his own wife among them and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins the young ones his son among them had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults to prepare the late supper and if there was time enough to play in the few minutes of sun that were left when he moses finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned all that was left of the sun was a fiveinchlong memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right he had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours he paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him the mule quivered wanting home and rest moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread he worked the dirt around in his mouth and swallowed leaning his head back and opening his eyes in time to see the strip of sun fade to dark blue and then to nothing he was the only man in the realm slave or free who ate dirt but while the bondage women particularly the pregnant ones ate it for some incomprehensible need for that something that ash cakes and apples and fatback did not give their bodies he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life this was july and july dirt tasted even more like sweetened metal than the dirt of june or may something in the growing crops unleashed a metallic life that only began to dissipate in midaugust and by harvest time that life would be gone altogether replaced by a sour moldiness he associated with the coming of fall and winter the end of a relationship he had begun with the first taste of dirt back in march before the first hard spring rain now with the sun gone and no moon and the darkness having taken a nice hold of him he walked to the end of the row holding the mule by the tail in the clearing he dropped the tail and moved around the mule toward the barn the mule followed him and after he had prepared the animal for the night and came out moses smelled the coming of rain he breathed deeply feeling it surge through him believing he was alone he smiled he knelt down to be closer to the earth and breathed deeply some more finally when the effect began to dwindle he stood and turned away for the third time that week from the path that led to the narrow lane of the quarters with its people and his own cabin his woman and his boy his wife knew enough now not to wait for him to come and eat with them on a night with the moon he could see some of the smoke rising from the world that was the lane home and food and rest and what passed in many cabins for the life of family he turned his head slightly to the right and made out what he thought was the sound of playing children but when he turned his head back he could hear far more clearly the last bird of the day as it eveningchirped in the small forest far off to the left he went straight ahead to the farthest edge of the cornfields to a patch of woods that had yielded nothing of value since the day his master bought it from a white man who had gone broke and returned to ireland i did well over there that man lied to his people back in ireland his dying wife standing hunched over beside him but i longed for all of you and for the wealth of my homeland the patch of woods of no more than three acres did yield some soft blue grass that no animal would touch and many trees that no one could identify just before moses stepped into the woods the rain began and as he walked on the rain became heavier well into the forest the rain came in torrents through the trees and the mighty summer leaves and after a bit moses stopped and held out his hands and collected water that he washed over his face then he undressed down to his nakedness and lay down to keep the rain out of his nose he rolled up his shirt and placed it under his head so that it tilted just enough for the rain to flow down about his face when he was an old man and rheumatism chained up his body he would look back and blame the chains on evenings such as these and on nights when he lost himself completely and fell asleep and didnt come to until morning covered with dew the ground was almost soaked the leaves seemed to soften the hard rain as it fell and it hit his body and face with no more power than the gentle tapping of fingers he opened his mouth it was rare for him and the rain to meet up like this his eyes had remained open and after taking in all that he could without turning his head he took up his thing and did it when he was done after a few strokes he closed his eyes turned on his side and dozed after a half hour or so the rain stopped abruptly
