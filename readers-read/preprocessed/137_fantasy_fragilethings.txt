fresh from their stupendous european tour where they performed before several of the crowned heads of europe garnering their plaudits and praise with magnificent dramatic performances combining both comedy and tragedy the strand players wish to make it known that they shall be appearing at the royal court theatre drury lane for a limited engagement in april at which they will present my look alike brother tom the littlest violet seller and the great old ones come this last an historical epic of pageantry and delight each an entire play in one act tickets are available now from the box office it is the immensity i believe the hugeness of things below the darkness of dreams but i am woolgathering forgive me i am not a literary man i had been in need of lodgings that was how i met him i wanted someone to share the cost of rooms with me we were introduced by a mutual acquaintance in the chemical laboratories of st bart146s you have been in afghanistan i perceive that was what he said to me and my mouth fell open and my eyes opened very wide astonishing i said not really said the stranger in the white lab coat who was to become my friend from the way you hold your arm i see you have been wounded and in a particular way you have a deep tan you also have a military bearing and there are few enough places in the empire that a military man can be both tanned and given the nature of the injury to your shoulder and the traditions of the afghan cave folk tortured put like that of course it was absurdly simple but then it always was i had been tanned nut brown and i had indeed as he had observed been tortured the gods and men of afghanistan were savages unwilling to be ruled from whitehall or from berlin or even from moscow and unprepared to see reason i had been sent into those hills attached to the8212th regiment as long as the fighting remained in the hills and mountains we fought on an equal footing when the skirmishes descended into the caves and the darkness then we found ourselves as it were out of our depth and in over our heads i shall not forget the mirrored surface of the underground lake nor the thing that emerged from the lake its eyes opening and closing and the singing whispers that accompanied it as it rose wreathing their way about it like the buzzing of flies bigger than worlds that i survived was a miracle but survive i did and i returned to england with my nerves in shreds and tatters the place that leech like mouth had touched me was tattooed forever frog white into the skin of my now withered shoulder i had once been a crack shot now i had nothing save a fear of the world beneath the world akin to panic which meant that i would gladly pay sixpence of my army pension for a hansom cab rather than a penny to travel underground still the fogs and darknesses of london comforted me took me in i had lost my first lodgings because i screamed in the night i had been in afghanistan i was there no longer i scream in the night i told him i have been told that i snore he said also i keep irregular hours and i often use the mantelpiece for target practice i will need the sitting room to meet clients i am selfish private and easily bored will this be a problem i smiled and i shook my head and extended my hand we shook on it the rooms he had found for us in baker street were more than adequate for two bachelors i bore in mind all my friend had said about his desire for privacy and i forbore from asking what it was he did for a living still there was much to pique my curiosity visitors would arrive at all hours and when they did i would leave the sitting room and repair to my bedroom pondering what they could have in common with my friend the pale woman with one eye bone white the small man who looked like a commercial traveler the portly dandy in his velvet jacket and the rest some were frequent visitors many others came only once spoke to him and left looking troubled or looking satisfied he was a mystery to me we were partaking of one of our landlady146s magnificent breakfasts one morning when my friend rang the bell to summon that good lady there will be a gentleman joining us in about four minutes he said we will need another place at table very good she said i146ll put more sausages under the grill my friend returned to perusing his morning paper i waited for an explanation with growing impatience finally i could stand it no longer i don146t understand how could you know that in four minutes we would be receiving a visitor there was no telegram no message of any kind he smiled thinly you did not hear the clatter of a brougham several minutes ago it slowed as it passed us8212obviously as the driver identified our door then it sped up and went past up into the marylebone road there is a crush of carriages and taxicabs letting off passengers at the railway station and at the waxworks and it is in that crush that anyone wishing to alight without being observed will go the walk from there to here is but four minutes he glanced at his pocket watch and as he did so i heard a tread on the stairs outside come in lestrade he called the door is ajar and your sausages are just coming out from under the grill
