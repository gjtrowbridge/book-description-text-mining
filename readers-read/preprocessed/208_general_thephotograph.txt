 kath kath steps from the landing cupboard where she should not be the landing cupboard is stacked high with what glyn calls lowuse material conference papers and student references and offprints including he hopes an offprint that he needs right now for the article on which he is working the strata in here go back to his postgraduate days in no convenient sequential order but all jumbled up and juxtaposed a crisp column of past and present is wedged against a heap of tattered files spewing forth their contents forgotten students drift to his feet as he rummages and lie reproachful on the floor susan cochranes contributions to my seminar have been perfunctory labelled boxes of photographs aerial bishops munby 1979 leeds 1985 are squeezed against a further row of files to remove one will bring the lot crashing down like an illjudged move in that game involving a tower of balanced blocks but he has glimpsed behind them a further cache which may well include offprints on the shelf above he spots the goldlettered spine of his own doctoral thesis its green cloth blotched brown with age on top of it sits a 1980s run of the yorkshire archaeological journal come to think of it the contents of the landing cupboard are a nice reflection of his own trade it is a landscape in which everything coexists requiring expert deconstruction but he does not dwell on that intent instead upon this increasingly irritating search he tugs at a file to improve his view of what lies beyond and sure enough there is a landslide exasperated he gets down on hands and knees to shovel up this mess and suddenly there is kath a brown foolscapsize wallet file with her loopy scrawl across the flap keep she smiles at him he sees her skimpy dark fringe her eyes that smile what is she doing here in the middle of all this stuff that has nothing to do with her he picks up the file stares he cannot think how it got here everything of hers was cleared out back then when she when hang on though here underneath it are a couple of folders also with her handwriting recipes since when did kath go in for serious cooking for heavens sake he opens the folder flicks through the contents indeed yes cuttings from newspapers and magazines in the late 1980s but petering out fairly rapidly which signifies he investigates the second folder which contains receipted bills many of them redflagged second demands which signifies also and an incomplete series of bank statements indicating a mounting overdraft it would seem that this assortment of her things got pushed in with his papers by mistake during the big clearingout operation the hurried distracted clearingout operation elaine had volunteered to sort out and dispose of kaths possessions she missed this lot and here they have lain ever since festering well no not exactly festering but turning a little brown at the edges doggedly degrading away as is everything else in here doing what inanimate objects do as time passes preparing to give pause for thought to those whose business is the interpretation of vanished landscapes the wallet file is brown anyway so degradation is not much apparent he dumps the folders on the floor and goes to sit on the top step of the stairs holding the file he opens it not much inside various documents and a sealed brown envelope containing something stiff glyn sets this aside and goes through the rest a jewellers valuation for a twostrand pearl necklace and a pair of drop pearl earrings originally her mothers he seems to remember kath wore the earrings a lot her medical card and her birth certificate aha so this is where that was the absence of which caused considerable nuisance back then necessitating a visit to somerset house no marriage certificate one notes that too had gone missing making difficulties and is still lost it would seem not that that is now a problem her 0level certificate seven subjects a grades in all but one glyn scans this with some surprise well well whod have thought it the injunction on the files flap was presumably to herself this was the repository for items she knew that she must hang on to but knowing herself that she knew she was only too likely to lose he experiences a stir of fondness which disconcerts him and he has been entirely diverted from the hunt for that offprint which is a matter of some urgency fondness is overtaken by annoyance kath is getting in the way of his work which was not allowed as she well understood there is also a national savings certificate for 5 bearing a date in the mid 1950s when she was about eight for heavens sake and some chequebook stubs and a post office savings book showing a balance of 1458 and a clutch of letters at which he glances the letters are from kaths mother the mother who died when she was sixteen glyn sees no reason to be interested in these and pushes them back into the file unread he is left with a semiopaque folder which turns out to hold a sequence of studio portraits of kath she is looking at him in glossy black and white now made entirely manifest young kath a backlit kath with bare shoulders head turned this way or that eyes to camera or demurely lowered provocative smile contemplative sideways gaze these would date from the aspiring actress days long before he knew her very young kath glyn studies these photos for quite a while kath he returns everything to the file there is now just this brown envelope he notices for the first time that something is written on it in her hand lightly pencilled dont opendestroy and for whom is this second instruction intended he opens the envelope within are a photograph and a folded sheet of paper he looks first at the photograph a group of five people grass beneath their feet a backdrop of trees two members of the group a man and a woman have their backs to the photographer of the other three elaine can be identified at once visible between the two whose faces cannot be seen near to her stand another man and woman whom glyn does not recognize one of the backturned pair is kath he would know that outline anywhere that stance the someone else the man is at first a bit of a teaser familiar surely the rather long dark hair the height a good head taller than kath a slightly hunched way of standing glyn brings the photo closer to his face for more minute inspection and then he sees he sees the hands he sees that kath and this someone this man have their hands closely entwined locked together pushed behind them so that as they stand side by side in this moment of private intimacy this interlocking of hands would be invisible to the rest of the group except to the photographer who may or may not have been aware of what had been immortalized the freezeframe revelation and now glyn recognizes the someone the man it is nick he turns to the folded piece of paper that accompanied the photograph he feels as though gripped by the onset of some incapacitating disease but this paper requires attention handwriting a brief message i cant resist sending you this negative destroyed im told blessings my love no signature none needed neither for kath then nor now for glyn though confirmation is needed somewhere he will have an instance of nicks handwriting a signature a letter from way back when he was a consultant or some such nonsense on that landscape history series nick published and of which he endlessly and ignorantly enthused as nick always did the disease now has him by the throat the throat the gut the balls what he feels is well what he experiences is the most appalling stomachchurning headspinning cauldron of emotion rage is the topnote beneath that a seethe of jealousy and humiliation the whole primed with some kind of furious drive and energy where when who who took this photograph who presumably passed it on to nick and destroyed the negative the telephone rings down in his study such is glyns powered state his consuming purpose that he is at once on his feet and halfway down the stairs to pick it up and snap i am not available sorry i cannot be doing with you right now because i have just learned that the woman who was once my wife had an affair with her sisters husband apparently at some time yet to be identified i am evidently a dupe a cuckold my understanding of the past has been savagely undermined you will appreciate that for the foreseeable future this requires all my attention the phone stops of course the answerphone is on
