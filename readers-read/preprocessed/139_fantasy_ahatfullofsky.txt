it came crackling over the hills like an invisible fog movement without a body tired it and it drifted very slowly it wasnt thinking now it had been months since it had last thought because the brain that was doing the thinking for it had died they always died so now it was naked again and frightened it could hide in one of the blobby white creatures that baad nervously as it crawled over the turf but they had useless brains capable of thinking only about grass and making other things that went baa no they would not do it needed needed something better a strong mind a mind with power a mind that could keep it safe it searched the new boots were all wrong they were stiff and shiny shiny boots that was disgraceful clean boots that was different there was nothing wrong with putting a bit of a polish on boots to keep the wet out but boots had to work for a living they shouldnt shine tiffany aching standing on the rug in her bedroom shook her head shed have to scuff the things as soon as possible then there was the new straw hat with a ribbon on it she had some doubts about that too she tried to look at herself in the mirror which wasnt easy because the mirror was not much bigger than her hand and cracked and blotchy she had to move it around to try and see as much of herself as possible and remember how the bits fitted together but today well she didnt usually do this sort of thing in the house but it was important to look smart today and since no one was around she put the mirror down on the rickety table by the bed stood in the middle of the threadbare rug shut her eyes and said see me and away on the hills something a thing with no body and no mind but a terrible hunger and a bottomless fear felt the power it would have sniffed the air if it had a nose it searched it found such a strange mind like a lot of minds inside one another getting smaller and smaller so strong so close it changed direction slightly and went a little faster as it moved it made a noise like a swarm of flies the sheep nervous for a moment about something they couldnt see or smell baad and went back to chewing grass tiffany opened her eyes there she was a few feet away from herself she could see the back of her own head carefully she moved around the room not looking down at the her that was moving because she found that if she did that then the trick was over it was quite difficult moving like that but at last she was in front of herself and looking herself up and down brown hair to match brown eyes well there was nothing she could do about that at least her hair was clean and shed washed her face she had a new dress on which improved things a bit it was so unusual to buy new clothes in the aching family that of course it was bought big so that shed grow into it but at least it was pale green and it didnt actually touch the floor with the shiny new boots and the straw hat she looked like a farmers daughter quite respectable going off to her first job itd have to do from here she could see the pointy hat on her head but she had to look hard for it it was like a glint in the air gone as soon as you saw it thats why shed been worried about the new straw hat but it had simply gone through the pointy hat as if it wasnt there this was because in a way it wasnt it was invisible except in the rain sun and wind went straight through but rain and snow somehow saw it and treated it as if it was real shed been given it by the greatest witch in the world a real witch with a black dress and a black hat and eyes that could go through you like turpentine goes through a sick sheep it had been a kind of reward tiffany had done magic serious magic before she had done it she hadnt known that she could when she had been doing it she hadnt known that she was and after she had done it she hadnt known how she had now she had to learn how see me not she said the vision of her or whatever it was because she was not exactly sure about this trick vanished it had been a shock the first time shed done this but shed always found it easy to see herself at least in her head all her memories were like little pictures of herself doing things or watching things rather than the view from the two holes in the front of her head there was a part of her that was always watching her miss tick another witch but one who was easier to talk to than the witch whod given tiffany the hat had said that a witch had to know how to stand apart and that shed find out more when her talent grew so tiffany supposed the see me was part of this sometimes tiffany thought she ought to talk to miss tick about see me it felt as if she was stepping out of her body but still had a sort of ghost body that could walk around it all worked as long as her ghost eyes didnt look down and see that she was just a ghost body if that happened some part of her panicked and she found herself back in her solid body immediately tiffany had in the end decided to keep this to herself you didnt have to tell a teacher everything anyway it was a good trick for when you didnt have a mirror
