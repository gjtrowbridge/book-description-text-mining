 the fbis killing machine the white knights of the ku klux klan who ruled neshoba county mississippi had a nickname for michael mickey schwerner the new york white boy who came down to meridian that freedom summer to register black voters goatee they called him andrew goodman another young white man and james chaney a black civil rights worker were referred to more prosaically as outside agitators on june 21 1964 the three young men members of the congress of racial equality core had come to nearby philadelphia mississippi to investigate the klan burning of mt zion an african american church according to evidence presented at a federal trial years later edgar ray killen a local preacher and kkk kleagle conspired with at least twenty other klansmen to lie in wait for the three men arrested by cecil price the town deputy for speeding goodman schwerner and chaney had been jailed for five hours presiding over a klan meeting that night at the long horn drivein killen purportedly described what should happen to the young men as elimination but one of the klansmen would later testify that killens death warrant was less delicate he said those civil rights workers were locked up and they needed their rear ends tore up released after midnight so that two cars full of klansman could follow their progress undetected goodman schwerner and chaney left the neshoba county sheriffs office heading north from philadelphia in a ford station wagon they were never seen alive again hiding behind an old warehouse the twocar klan convoy followed by deputy price in his patrol car hung back until goodman schwerner and chaney cleared the outskirts of town at that point they gave chase with one vehicle a red chevy roaring up beside the ford wagon and attempting to force it off the road after a pursuit on highway 19 that topped speeds of one hundred miles an hour deputy price flashed his red light pulled the ford over and ordered the civil rights workers to get out the three young men complained holding their hands up when flashlights were pointed in their eyes they were then driven thirtyfour miles away when the convoy turned off onto a graded clay road goodman and the others were ordered out of their cars again and shot to death where they stood their bodies were thrown into the back of their own station wagon and driven to the farm of a wealthy philadelphia businessman there they were dumped at the base of an earthen dam while a bulldozer entombed them beneath fifteen feet of red clay their disappearance touched off a firestorm at the justice department dozens of darksuited fbi agents were dispatched to neshoba county in what the bureau dubbed the missburn case as recreated in the 1988 film mississippi burning the agents located the ford which had been taken to a local swamp area and burned but soon the investigation stopped dead terrified blacks and protective whites hid that fact that the murders had been the work of twentyone local men from the klan klavern in 1964 the fbi may have been hated in mississippi but the klan was feared at that point the selfdescribed white knights were waging a war of domestic terror throughout the state perpetrating church bombings arsons and the beating of black citizens nobody and i mean nobody was gonna give up those boys recalls w o chet dillard a neshoba county judge who had served as district attorney several years later5 old j edgar figured that if he was gonna break that thing and he was hurtin to break it he was gonna have to go to some extreme measures and he did j edgar hoover the notorious fbi director who for years had denied even the existence of organized crime in america decided to call on a man who had already earned a position in an elite group inside the bureau known as te for top echelon since 1962 gregory scarpa sr had been living two lives6 a young bensonhurst brooklyn cock of the walk scarpa was a soldier in the columbo crime family but he was also working as a mole an informant for the fbi years later scarpas boss joe colombo would tear up the mafia rule book which demanded anonymity and found the italian american civil rights league it was a very public italoamerican advocacy group that regularly picketed fbi offices and staged rallies to denouce the bureau for forever bothering italians in time greg scarpa would become one of colombos flashiest spokesmen he was also a lucrative earner bringing in tens of thousands of dollars a month from bookmaking loansharking credit card fraud and other racketeering operations but he had a violent side bragging that he loved the smell of gunpowder and punching a satanic 666 into the beepers of fellow wiseguys each time he made a kill and yet on the flip side of his double life he would sit down at least once a week with anthony villano his bureau control agent spilling a host of secrets on the inner workers of what hoover later dubbed the lcn la cosa nostra soon scarpa married and had a son whom he named after himself but he didnt draw greg jr into the family business until he was a teenager dubbed the grim reaper and the mad hatter by his colleagues greg scarpa sr became known as a capo who could take a fellow wiseguy to lunch joke with him over a plate of ziti and shoot him between the eyes before the check was paid he had one of his victims hit while he was stringing christmas lights in front of his wife and ordered a grave dug for another victim in advance of the whack later when joe columbo was killed in a columbus circle rally in 1971 scarpa became the principal shooter in a war of succession between rival factions of the columbo family at first the family was taken over by carmine the snake persico but when persico went to prison leadership passed to his son alphonse aka allie boy who was widely perceived as weak the war that followed was bloody the result was a series of driveby shootings and gun battles that played out across brooklyn and staten island between 1991 and 1992 in the end twelve were dead including two innocent bystanders and a third of the victims were murdered by greg scarpa sr himself interrogation by razor blade back in 1964 however when the call came from hoover greg scarpa sr was still just a ruthless young soldati with ice water in his veins the latterday historical perception of the case has been shaped by the film mississippi burning in which the kidnapping and triple murder is broken by an african american fbi agent who is flown down to question the towns mayor but through previously unpublished documents from declassified fbi files interviews with neshoba county residents and other research for the first time the real story has finally come to light in truth it was greg scarpa sr using his talents as an enforcer who broke the goodman schwernerchaney case having been authorized by hoover for what the fbi called the special greg flew with his seventeenyearold girlfriend linda diana to mobile alabama where he was met by fbi agents who gave him a gun according to biographer sandra harmon who spent months interviewing linda for a book scarpa told her im going out with these men if im not back theres a return ticket and heres some money passing her a folded stack of bills declassified fbi documents and the files of judge dillard who was then neshoba county da show that scarpa was then driven to philadelphia mississippi where with the help of fbi agents he kidnapped a local politician they took him to an undisclosed location said judge dillard and while the agents waited outside scarpa started working on the guy
