 1945 may 4 622 am fortress city of breslau poland the body floated in the sludge that sluiced through the dank sewers the corpse of a boy bloated and rat gnawed had been stripped of boots pants and shirt nothing went to waste in the besieged city ss obergruppenf252hrer jakob sporrenberg nudged past the corpse stirring the filth offal and excrement blood and bile the wet scarf tied around his nose and mouth did little to ward off the stench this was what the great war had come to the mighty reduced to crawling through sewers to escape but he had his orders overhead the double crumpwump of russian artillery pummeled the city each explosion bruised his gut with its concussive shock the russians had broken down the gates bombed the airport and even now tanks ground down the cobbled streets while transport carriers landed on kaiserstrasse the main thoroughfare had been converted into a landing strip by parallel rows of flaming oil barrels adding their smoke to the already choked early morning skies keeping dawn at bay fighting waged in every street in every home from attic to basement every house a fortress that had been gauleiter hankes final command to the populace the city had to hold out as long as possible the future of the third reich depended on it and on jakob sporrenberg mach schnell he urged the others behind him his unit of the sicherheitsdienst designation special evacuation kommando trailed him kneedeep in filthy water fourteen men all armed all dressed in black all burdened with heavy packs in the middle four of the largest men former nordsee dockmen bore poles on their shoulders bearing aloft massive crates there was a reason the russians were striking this lone city deep in the sudeten mountains between germany and poland the fortifications of breslau guarded the gateway to the highlands beyond for the past two years forced labor from the concentration camp of grossrosen had hollowed out a neighboring mountain peak a hundred kilometers of tunnels clawed and blasted all to service one secret project one kept buried away from prying allied eyes die riese the giant but word had still spread perhaps one of the villagers outside the wenceslas mine had whispered of the illness the sudden malaise that had afflicted even those well outside the complex if only theyd had more time to complete the research still a part of jakob sporrenberg balked he didnt know all that was involved with the secret project mostly just the code name chronos still he knew enough he had seen the bodies used in the experiments he had heard the screams abomination that was the one word that had come to mind and iced his blood hed had no trouble executing the scientists the sixtytwo men and women had been taken outside and shot twice in the head no one must know what had transpired in the depths of the wenceslas mine or what was found only one researcher was allowed to live doktor tola hirszfeld jakob heard her sloshing behind him half dragged by one of his men wrists secured behind her back she was tall for a woman late twenties small breasted but of ample waist and shapely legs her hair flowed smooth and black her skin as pale as milk from the months spent underground she was to have been killed with the others but her father oberarbeitsleiter hugo hirszfeld overseer of the project had finally shown his corrupted blood his halfjewish heritage he had attempted to destroy his research files but he had been shot by one of the guards and killed before he could firebomb his subterranean office fortunately for his daughter someone with full knowledge of die glocke had to survive to carry on the work she a genius like her father knew his research better than any of the other scientists but she would need coaxing from here fire burned in her eyes whenever jakob glanced her way he could feel her hatred like the heat of an open furnace but she would cooperate like her father had before her jakob knew how to deal with juden especially those of mixed blood mischlinge they were the worst partial jews there were some hundred thousand mischlinge in military service to the reich jewish soldiers rare exemptions to nazi law had allowed such mixed blood to still serve sparing their lives it required special dispensation such mischlinge usually proved to be the fiercest soldiers needing to show their loyalty to reich over race still jakob had never trusted them tolas father proved the validity of his suspicions the doctors attempted sabotage had not surprised jakob juden were never to be trusted only exterminated but hugo hirszfelds exemption papers had been signed by the f252hrer himself sparing not only the father and daughter but also a pair of elderly parents somewhere in the middle of germany so while jakob had no trust of the mischlinge he placed his full faith in his f252hrer his orders had been letter specific evacuate the mine of the necessary resources to continue the work and destroy the rest that meant sparing the daughter and the baby the newborn boy was swaddled and bundled into a pack a jewish infant no more than a month old the child had been given a light sedative to keep him silent as they made their escape within the child burned the heart of the abomination the true source of jakobs revulsion all of the hopes for the third reich lay in his tiny hands the hands of a jewish infant bile rose at such a thought better to impale the child on a bayonet but he had his orders he also saw how tola watched the boy her eyes glowed with a mix of fire and grief besides aiding in her fathers research tola had served as the boys foster mother rocking him asleep feeding him the child was the only reason the woman was cooperating at all it had been a threat on the boys life that had finally made tola acquiesce to jakobs demands
