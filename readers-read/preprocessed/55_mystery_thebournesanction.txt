 who is david webbquot moira trevor standing in front of his desk at georgetown university asked the question so seriously that jason bourne felt obliged to answer quotstrangequot he said quotno ones ever asked me that before david webb is a linguistics expert a man with two children who are living happily with their grandparentsquot maries parents quoton a ranch in canadaquot moira frowned quotdont you miss themquot quoti miss them terriblyquot bourne said quotbut the truth is theyre far better off where they are what kind of life could i offer them and then theres the constant danger from my bourne identity marie was kidnapped and threatened in order to force me to do something i had no intention of doing i wont make that mistake againquot quotbut surely you see them from time to timequot quotas often as i can but its difficult i cant afford to have anyone following me back to themquot quotmy heart goes out to youquot moira said meaning it she smiled quoti must say its odd seeing you here on a university campus behind a deskquot she laughed quotshall i buy you a pipe and a jacket with elbow patchesquot bourne smiled quotim content here moira really i amquot quotim happy for you martins death was difficult for both of us my anodyne is going back to work fullbore yours is obviously here in a new lifequot quotan old life reallyquot bourne looked around the office quotmarie was happiest when i was teaching when she could count on me being home every night in time to have dinner with her and the kidsquot quotwhat about youquot moira asked quotwere you happiest herequot a cloud passed across bournes face quoti was happy being with mariequot he turned to her quoti cant imagine being able to say that to anyone else but youquot quota rare compliment from you jasonquot quotare my compliments so rarequot quotlike martin youre a master at keeping secretsquot she said quotbut i have doubts about how healthy that isquot quotim sure its not healthy at allquot bourne said quotbut its the life we chose quotspeaking of whichquot she sat down on a chair opposite him quoti came early for our dinner date to talk to you about a work situation but now seeing how content you are here i dont know whether to continuequot bourne recalled the first time he had seen her a slim shapely figure in the mist dark hair swirling about her face she was standing at the parapet in the cloisters overlooking the hudson river the two of them had come there to say goodbye to their mutual friend martin lindros whom bourne had valiantly tried to save only to fail today moira was dressed in a wool suit a silk blouse open at the throat her face was strong with a prominent nose deep brown eyes wide apart intelligent curved slightly at their outer corners her hair fell to her shoulders in luxuriant waves there was an uncommon serenity about her a woman who knew what she was about who wouldnt be intimidated or bullied by anyone woman or man perhaps this last was what bourne liked best about her in that though in no other way she was like marie he had never pried into her relationship with martin but he assumed it had been romantic since martin had given bourne standing orders to send her a dozen red roses should he ever die this bourne had done with a sadness whose depth surprised even him settled in her chair one long shapely leg crossed over her knee she looked the model of a european businesswoman she had told him that she was half french half english but her genes still carried the imprint of ancient venetian and turkish ancestors she was proud of the fire in her mixed blood the result of wars invasions fierce love quotgo onquot he leaned forward elbows on his desk quoti want to hear what you have to sayquot she nodded quotall right as ive told you nextgen energy solutions has completed our new liquid natural gas terminal in long beach our first shipment is due in two weeks i had this idea which now seems utterly crazy but here goes id like you to head up the security procedures my bosses are worried the terminal would make an awfully tempting target for any terrorist group and i agree frankly i cant think of anyone whod make it more secure than youquot quotim flattered moira but i have obligations here as you know professor specter has installed me as the head of the comparative linguistics department i dont want to disappoint himquot quoti like dominic specter jason really i do youve made it clear that hes your mentor actually hes david webbs mentor right but its jason bourne i first met it feels like its jason bourne ive been coming to know these last few months who is jason bournes mentorquot bournes face darkened as it had at the mention of marie quotalex conklins deadquot moira shifted in her chair quotif you come work with me theres no baggage attached to it think about it its a chance to leave your past lives behind both david webbs and jason bournes im flying to munich shortly because a key element of the terminal is being manufactured there i need an expert opinion on it when i check the specsquot quotmoira there are any number of experts you can usequot quotbut none whose opinion i trust as much as yours this is crucial stuff jason more than half the goods shipped into the united states come through the port at long beach so our security measures have to be something special the us government has already shown it has neither the time nor the inclination to secure commercial traffic so were forced to police it ourselves the danger to this terminal is real and its serious i know how expert you are at bypassing even the most arcane security systems youre the perfect candidate to put nonconventional measures into placequot bourne stood quotmoira listen to me marie was david webbs biggest cheerleader since her death ive let go of him completely but hes not dead hes not an invalid he lives on inside me when i fall asleep i dream of his life as if it was someone elses and i wake up in a sweat i feel as if a part of me has been sliced off i dont want to feel that way anymore its time to give david webb his duequot veronica harts step was light and virtually carefree as she was admitted past checkpoint after checkpoint on her way into the bunker that was the west wing of the white house the job she was about to be handed director of central intelligence was a formidable one especially in the aftermath of last years twin debacles of murder and gross breach of security nevertheless she had never been happier having a sense of purpose was vital to her being singled out for daunting responsibility was the ultimate validation of all the arduous work setbacks and threats shed had to endure because of her gender there was also the matter of her age at fortysix she was the youngest dci in recent memory being the youngest at something was nothing new to her her astonishing intelligence combined with her fierce determination to ensure that she was the youngest to graduate from her college youngest to be appointed to military intelligence to central army command to a highly lucrative black river private intelligence position in afghanistan and the horn of africa where to this day not even the heads of the seven directorates within ci knew precisely where she had been posted whom she commanded or what her mission had been now at last she was steps away from the apex the top of the intelligence heap shed successfully leapt all the hurdles sidestepped every trap negotiated every maze learned who to befriend and who to show her back to she had endured relentless sexual innuendo rumors of conduct unbecoming stories of her reliance on her male inferiors who supposedly did her thinking for her in each case she had triumphed emphatically putting a stake through the heart of the lies and in some instances taking down their instigators she was at this stage of her life a force to be reckoned with a fact in which she justifiably reveled so it was with a light heart that she approached her meeting with the president in her briefcase was a thick file detailing the changes she proposed to make in ci to clean up the unholy mess left behind by karim aljamil and the subsequent murder of her predecessor not surprisingly ci was in total disarray morale had never been lower and of course there was resentment across the board from the allmale directorate heads each of whom felt he should have been elevated to dci the chaos and low morale were about to change and she had a raft of initiatives to ensure it she was absolutely certain that the president would be delighted not only with her plans but also with the speed with which she would implement them an intelligence organization as important and vital as ci could not long endure the despair into which it had sunk only the antiterrorist black ops typhon brainchild of martin lindros was running normally and for that she had its new director soraya moore to thank sorayas assumption of command had been seamless her operatives loved her would follow her into the fires of hades should she ask it of them as for the rest of ci it was for herself to heal energize and give a refocused sense of purpose she was surprised perhaps shocked wasnt too strong a word to find the oval office occupied not only by the president but also by luther lavalle the pentagons intelligence czar and his deputy general richard p kendall ignoring the others she walked across the plush american blue carpet to shake the presidents hand she was tall longnecked and slender her ashblond hair was cut in a stylish fashion that fell short of being masculine but lent her a businesslike air she wore a midnightblue suit lowheeled pumps small gold earrings and a minimum of makeup her nails were cut square across quotplease have a seat veronicaquot the president said quotyou know luther lavalle and general kendallquot quotyesquot veronica inclined her head fractionally quotgentlemen a pleasure to see youquot though nothing could be farther from the truth she hated lavalle in many ways he was the most dangerous man in american intelligence not the least because he was backed by the immensely powerful e r quotbudquot halliday the secretary of defense lavalle was a powerhungry egotist who believed that he and his people should be running american intelligence period he fed on war the way other people fed on meat and potatoes and though she had never been able to prove it she suspected that he was behind several of the more lurid rumors that had circulated about her he enjoyed ruining other peoples reputations savored standing impudently on the skulls of his enemies ever since afghanistan and subsequently iraq lavalle had seized the initiative under the typically wideranging and murky pentagon rubric of quotpreparing the battlefieldquot for the troops to come to expand the purview of the pentagons intelligencegathering initiatives until now they encroached uncomfortably on those of ci it was an open secret within american intelligence circles that he coveted cis operatives and its longestablished international networks now with the old man and his anointed successor dead it would fit lavalles mo to try to make a land grab in the most aggressive manner possible this was why his presence and that of his lapdog set off the most serious warning bells inside veronicas mind there were three chairs ranged in a rough semicircle in front of the presidents desk two of them were of course filled veronica took the third chair acutely aware that she was flanked by the two men doubtless by design she laughed inwardly if these two thought to intimidate her by making her feel surrounded they were sorely mistaken but then as the president began to talk she hoped to god her laugh wouldnt echo hollowly in her mind an hour from now dominic specter hurried around the corner as bourne was locking the door to his office the deep frown that creased his high forehead vanished the moment he saw bourne quotdavid im so glad i caught you before you leftquot he said with great enthusiasm then turning his charm on bournes companion he added quotand with the magnificent moira no lessquot as always the perfect gentleman he bowed to her in the old world european fashion he returned his attention to bourne he was a short man full of unbridled energy despite his seventyodd years his head seemed perfectly round surmounted by a halo of hair that wound from ear to ear his eyes were dark and inquisitive his skin a deep bronze his generous mouth made him look vaguely and amusingly like a frog about to spring from one lily pad to another quota matter of some concern has come up and i need your opinionquot he smiled quoti see that this evening is out of the question would dinner tomorrow be inconvenientquot bourne discerned something behind specters smile that gave him pause something was troubling his old mentor quotwhy dont we meet for breakfastquot quotare you certain im not putting you out davidquot but he couldnt hide the relief that flooded his face quotactually breakfast is better for mequot bourne lied to make things easier for specter quoteight oclockquot quotsplendid i look forward to itquot with a nod in moiras direction he was off quota firecrackerquot moira said quotif only id had professors like himquot bourne looked at her quotyour college years mustve been hellquot she laughed quotnot quite as bad as all that but then i only had two years of it before i fled to berlinquot quotif youd had professors like dominic specter your experience would have been far different believe mequot they sidestepped several knots of students gathered to gossip or to trade questions about their last classes they strode along the corridor out the doors descended the steps to the quad he and moira walked briskly across campus in the direction of the restaurant where they would have dinner students streamed past them hurrying down the paths between trees and lawns somewhere a band was playing in the stolid almost plodding rhythm endemic to colleges and universities the sky was steeped in clouds scudding overhead like clipper ships on the high seas a dank winter wind came streaming in off the potomac quotthere was a time when i was plunged deep in depression i knew it but i wouldnt accept it you know what i mean professor specter was the one who connected with me who was able to crack the shell i was using to protect myself to this day i have no idea how he did it or even why he persevered he said he saw something of himself in me in any event he wanted to helpquot they passed the ivycovered building where specter who was now the president of the school of international studies at georgetown had his office men in tweed coats and corduroy jackets passed in and out of the doors frowns of deep concentration on their faces quotprofessor specter gave me a job teaching linguistics it was like a life preserver to a drowning man what i needed most then was a sense of order and stability i honestly dont know what would have happened to me if not for him he alone understood that immersing myself in language makes me happy no matter who ive been the one constant is my proficiency with languages learning languages is like learning history from the inside out it encompasses the battles of ethnicity religion compromise politics so much can be learned from language because its been shaped by historyquot by this time they had left campus and were walking down 36th street nw toward 1789 a favorite restaurant of moiras which was housed in a federal town house when they arrived they were shown to a window table on the second floor in a dim paneled oldfashioned room with candles burning brightly on tables set with fine china and sparkling stemware they sat down facing each other and ordered drinks bourne leaned across the table said in a low voicequotlisten to me moira because im going to tell you something very few people know the bourne identity continues to haunt me marie used to worry that the decisions i was forced to make the actions i had to take as jason bourne would eventually drain me of all feeling that one day id come back to her and david webb would be gone for good i cant let that happenquot quotjason you and i have spent quite a bit of time with each other since we met to scatter martins ashes ive never seen a hint that youve lost any part of your humanityquot both sat back silent as the waiter set the drinks in front of them handed them menus as soon as he left bourne said quotthats reassuring believe me in the short time ive known you ive come to value your opinions youre not like anyone else ive ever metquot moira took a sip of her drink set it down all without taking her eyes from his quotthank you coming from you thats quite a compliment particularly because i know how special marie was to youquot bourne stared down at his drink moira reached across the starched white linen for his hand quotim sorry now youre drifting awayquot he glanced at her hand over his but didnt pull away when he looked up he said quoti relied on her for many things but i find now that those things are slipping away from mequot quotis that a bad thing or a good thingquot quotthats just itquot he said quoti dont knowquot moira saw the anguish in his face and her heart went out to him it was only months ago that shed seen him standing by the parapet in the cloisters he was clutching the bronze urn holding martins ashes as if he never wanted to let it go shed known then even if martin hadnt told her what theyd meant to each other quotmartin was your friendquot she said now quotyou put yourself in terrible jeopardy to save him dont tell me you didnt feel anything for him besides by your own admission youre not jason bourne now youre david webbquot he smiled quotyou have me therequot her face clouded over quoti want to ask you a question but i dont know whether i have the rightquot at once he responded to the seriousness of her expression quotof course you can ask moira go onquot she took a deep breath let it go quotjason i know youve said that youre content at the university and if thats so fine but i also know you blame yourself for not being able to save martin you must understand though if you couldnt save him no one could you did your best he knew that im sure and now i find myself wondering if you believe you failed him that youre not up to being jason bourne anymore i wonder if youve ever considered the idea that you accepted professor specters offer at the university in order to turn away from jason bournes lifequot quotof course ive considered itquot after martins death hed once again decided to turn his back on jason bournes life on the running the deaths a river that seemed to have as many bodies as the ganges always for him memories lurked the sad ones he remembered the others the shadowed ones that filled the halls of his mind seemed to have shape until he neared them when they flowed away like a tide at ebb and what was left behind were the bleached bones of all those hed killed or had been killed because of who he was but he knew just as surely that as long as he drew breath the bourne identity wouldnt die there was a tormented look in his eyes quotyou have to understand how difficult it is having two personalities always at war with each other i wish with every fiber of my being that i could cut one of them out of mequot moira said quotwhich one would it bequot quotthats the damnable partquot bourne said quotevery time i think i know i realize that i dontquot
