 it was 7 minutes after midnight the dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of mrs shears8217 house its eyes were closed it looked as if it was running on its side the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream but the dog was not running or asleep the dog was dead there was a garden fork sticking out of the dog the points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over i decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because i could not see any other wounds in the dog and i do not think you would stick a garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other reason like cancer for example or a road accident but i could not be certain about this i went through mrs shears8217 gate closing it behind me i walked onto her lawn and knelt beside the dog i put my hand on the muzzle of the dog it was still warm the dog was called wellington it belonged to mrs shears who was our friend she lived on the opposite side of the road two houses to the left wellington was a poodle not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles but a big poodle it had curly black fur but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow like chicken i stroked wellington and wondered who had killed him and why 3 my name is christopher john francis boone i know all the countries of the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7057 eight years ago when i first met siobhan she showed me this picture sad face and i knew that it meant 8216sad8217 which is what i felt when i found the dead dog then she showed me this picture smiley face and i knew that it meant 8216happy8217 like when i8217m reading about the apollo space missions or when i am still awake at 3 am or 4 am in the morning and i can walk up and down the street and pretend that i am the only person in the whole world then she drew some other pictures various happy sad confused surprised faces but i was unable to say what these meant i got siobhan to draw lots of these faces and then write down next to them exactly what they meant i kept the piece the piece of paper in my pocket and took it out when i didn8217t understand what someone was saying but it was very difficult to decide which of the diagrams was most like the face they were making because people8217s faces move very quickly when i told siobhan that i was doing this she got out a pencil and another piece of paper and said it probably made people feel very confused face and then she laughed so i tore the original piece of paper up and threw it away and siobhan apologised and now if i don8217t know what someone is saying i ask them what they mean or i walk away 5 i pulled the fork out of the dog and lifted him into my arms and hugged him he was leaking blood from the forkholes i like dogs you always know what a dog is thinking it has four moods happy sad cross and concentrating also dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk i had been hugging the dog for 4 minutes when i heard screaming i looked up and saw mrs shears running towards me from the patio she was wearing pyjamas and a housecoat her toenails were painted bright pink and she had no shoes on she was shouting 8216what in fuck8217s name have you done to my dog8217 i do not like people shouting at me it makes me scared that they are going to hit me or touch me and i do not know what is going to happen 8216let go of the dog8217 she shouted 8216let go of the fucking dog for christ8217s sake8217 i put the dog down on the lawn and moved back 2 metres she bent down i thought she was going to pick the dog up herself but she didn8217t perhaps she noticed how much blood there was and didn8217t want to get dirty instead she started screaming again i put my hands over my ears and closed my eyes and rolled forward till i was hunched up with my forehead pressed onto the grass the grass was wet and cold it was nice 7 this is a murder mystery novel siobhan said that i should write something i would want to read myself mostly i read books about science and maths i do not like proper novels in proper novels people say things like 8216i am veined with iron with silver and with streaks of common mud i cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus8217 what does this mean i do not know nor does father nor do siobhan or mr jeavons i have asked them siobhan has long blonde hair and wears glasses which are made of green plastic and mr jeavons smells of soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them but i do like murder mystery novels so i am writing a murder mystery novel in a murder mystery novel someone has to work out who the murderer is and then catch them it is a puzzle if it is a good puzzle you can sometimes work out the answer before the end of the book siobhan said that the book should begin with something to grab people8217s attention that is why i started with the dog i also started with the dog because it happened to me and i find it hard to imagine things which did not happen to me siobhan read the first page and said that it was different she put this word into inverted commas by making the wiggly quotation sign with her first and second fingers she said that it was usually people who were killed in murder mystery novels i said that two dogs were killed in the hound of the baskervilles the hound itself and james mortimer8217s spaniel but siobhan said they weren8217t the victims of the murder sir charles baskerville was she said that this was because readers cared more about people than dogs so if a person was killed in the book readers would want to carry on reading i said that i wanted to write about something real and i knew people who had died but i did not know any people who had been killed except edward8217s father from school mr paulson and that was a gliding accident not murder and i didn8217t really know him i also said that i cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people steve for example who comes to centre on thursdays needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a stick siobhan asked me not to say this to steve8217s mother 11 then the police arrived i like the police they have uniforms and numbers and you know what they are meant to be doing there was a policewoman and a policeman the policewoman had a little hole in her tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the hole the policeman had a big orange leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from one side the policewoman put her arms round mrs shears and led her back towards the house i lifted my head off the grass the policeman squatted down beside me and said 8216would you like to tell me what8217s going on here young man8217 i sat up and said 8216the dog is dead8217 8216i8217d got that far8217 he said i said 8216i think someone killed the dog8217 8216how old are you8217 he asked i replied 8216i am 15 years and 3 months and 2 days8217 8216and what precisely were you doing in the garden8217 he asked 8216i was holding the dog8217 i replied 8216and why were you holding the dog8217 he asked this was a difficult question it was something i wanted to do i like dogs it made me sad to see that the dog was dead i like policemen too and i wanted to answer the question properly but the policeman did not give me enough time to work out the correct answer 8216why were you holding the dog8217 he asked again 8216i like dogs8217 i said 8216did you kill the dog8217 he asked i said 8216i did not kill the dog8217 8216is this your fork8217 he asked i said 8216no8217 8216you seem very upset about this8217 he said he was asking too many questions and he was asking them too quickly they were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where uncle terry works the factory is a bakery and he operates the slicing machines and sometimes the slicer is not working fast enough but the bread keeps coming and there is a blockage i sometimes think of my mind as a machine but not always as a breadslicing machine it makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it the policeman said 8216i am going to ask you once again82308217 i rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead to the ground again and made the noise that father calls groaning i make this noise when there is too much information coming into my head from the outside world it is like when you are upset and you hold the radio against your ear and you tune it halfway between two stations so that all you get is white noise and then you turn the volume right up so that this is all you can hear and then you know you are safe because you cannot hear anything else the policeman took hold of my arm and lifted me onto my feet i didn8217t like him touching me like this and this is when i hit him 13 this will not be a funny book i cannot tell jokes because i do not understand them here is a joke as an example it is one of father8217s his face was drawn but the curtains were real i know why this is meant to be funny i asked it is because drawn has three meanings and they are 1 drawn with a pencil 2 exhausted and 3 pulled across a window and meaning 1 refers to both the face and the curtains meaning 2 refers only to the face and meaning 3 refers only to the curtains if i try to say the joke to myself making the word mean the three different things at the same time it is like hearing three different pieces of music at the same time which is uncomfortable and confusing and not nice like white noise it is like three people trying to talk to you at the same time about different things and that is why there are no jokes in this book 17 the policeman looked at me for a while without speaking then he said 8216i am arresting you for assaulting a police officer8217 this made me feel a lot calmer because it is what policeman say on television and in films then he said 8216i strongly advise you to get into the back of the police car because if you try any of that monkeybusiness again you little shit i will seriously lose my rag is that understood8217 i walked over to the police car which was parked just outside the gate he opened the back door and i got inside he climbed into the driver8217s seat and made a call on his radio to the policewoman who was still inside the house he said 8216the little bugger just had a pop at me kate can you hang on with mrs s while i drop him off at the station i8217ll get tony to swing by and pick you up8217 and she said 8216sure i8217ll catch you later8217 the policeman said 8216okeydoke8217 and we drove off the police car smelt of hot plastic and aftershave and takeaway chips i watched the sky as we drove towards the town centre it was a clear night and you could see the milky way some people think the milky way is a long line of stars but it isn8217t our galaxy is a huge disc of stars millions of light years across and the solar system is somewhere near the outside edge of the disc when you look in direction a at 90186 to the disc you don8217t see many stars but when you look in direction b you see lots more stars because you are looking into the main body of the galaxy and because the galaxy is a disc you see a stripe of stars and then i thought about how for a long time scientists were puzzled by the fact that the sky is dark at night even though there are billions of stars in the universe and there must be stars in every direction you look so that the sky should be full of starlight because there is very little in the way to stop the light reaching earth then they worked out that the universe was expanding that the stars were all rushing away from one another after the big bang and the further the stars were away from us the faster they were moving some of them nearly as fast as the speed of light which was why their light never reached us i like this fact it is something you can work out in your own mind just by looking at the sky above your head at night and thinking without having to ask anyone and when the universe has finished exploding all the stars will slow down like a ball that has been thrown into the air and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall towards the centre of the universe again and then there will be nothing to stop us seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving towards us gradually faster and faster and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars all falling except that no one will see this because there will be no people left on the earth to see it they will probably have become extinct by then and even if there are people still in existence they will not see it because the light will be so bright and hot that everyone will be burnt to death even if they live in tunnels 19 chapters in books are usually given the cardinal numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on but i have decided to give my chapters prime numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13 and so on because i like prime numbers this is how you work out what prime numbers are first you write down all the positive whole numbers in the world 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11121314151617181920 21222324252627282930 31323334353637383940 414243444546474849 etc then you take away all the numbers that are multiples of 2 then you take away all the numbers that are multiples of 3 then you take away all the numbers that are multiples of 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and so on the numbers that are left are the prime numbers 2357 11131719 2329 3137 414347 etc the rule for working out prime numbers is really simple but no one has ever worked out a simple formula for telling you whether a very big number is a prime number or what the next one will be if a number is really really big it can take a computer years to work out whether it is a prime number prime numbers are useful for writing codes and in america they are classed as military material and if you find one over 100 digits long you have to tell the cia and they buy it off you for 10000 but it would not be a very good way of making a living prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away i think prime numbers are like life they are very logical but you could never work out the rules even if you spent all your time thinking about them 23 when i got to the police station they made me take the laces out of my shoes and empty my pockets at the front desk in case i had anything in them that i could use to kill myself or escape or attack a policeman with the sergeant behind the desk had very hairy hands and he had bitten his nails so much that they had bled this is what i had in my pockets 1 a swiss army knife with 13 attachments including a wirestripper and a saw and a toothpick and tweezers 2 a piece of string 3 a piece of a wooden puzzle which looked like this 4 3 pellets of rat food for toby my rat 5 163147 this was made up of a 1631 coin a 20p coin two 10p coins a 5p coin and a 2p coin 6 a red paperclip 7 a key for the front door i was also wearing my watch and they wanted me to leave this at the desk as well but i said that i needed to keep my watch on because i needed to know exactly what time it was and when they tried to take it off me i screamed so they let me keep it on they asked me if i had any family i said i did they asked me who my family was i said it was father but mother was dead and i said it was also uncle terry but he was in sunderland and he was father8217s brother and it was my grandparents too but three of them were dead and grandma burton was in a home because she had senile dementia and thought that i was someone on television then they asked me for father8217s phone number i told them that he had two numbers one for at home and one which was a mobile phone and i said both of them it was nice in the police cell it was almost a perfect cube 2 metres long by 2 metres wide by 2 metres high it contained approximately 8 cubic metres of air it had a small window with bars and on the opposite side a metal door with a long thin hatch near the floor for sliding trays of food into the cell and a sliding hatch higher up so that policemen could look in and check that prisoners hadn8217t escaped or committed suicide there was also a padded bench i wondered how i would escape if i was in a story it would be difficult because the only things i had were my clothes and my shoes which had no laces in them i decided that my best plan would be to wait for a really sunny day and then use my glasses to focus the sunlight on a piece of my clothing and start a fire i would then make my escape when they saw the smoke and took me out of the cell and if they didn8217t notice i would be able to wee on the clothes and put them out i wondered whether mrs shears had told the police that i had killed wellington and whether when the police found out that she had lied she would go to prison because telling lies about people is called slander 29 i find people confusing this is for two main reasons the first main reason is that people do a lot of talking without using any words siobhan says that if you raise one eyebrow it can mean lots of different things it can mean 8216i want to do sex with you8217 and it can also mean 8216i think that what you just said was very stupid8217 siobhan also says that if you close your mouth and breath out loudly through your nose it can mean that you are relaxed or that you are bored or that you are angry and it all depends on how much air comes out of your nose and how fast and what shape your mouth is when you do it and how you are sitting and what you said just before and hundreds of other things which are too complicated to work out in a few seconds the second main reason is that people often talk using metaphors these are examples of metaphors i laughed my socks off he was the apple of her eye they had a skeleton in the cupboard we had a real pig of a day the dog was stone dead the word metaphor means carrying something from one place to another and it comes from the greek words meta which means from one place to another and ferein which means to carry and it is when you describe something by using a word for something that it isn8217t this means that the word metaphor is a metaphor i think it should be called a lie because a pig is not like a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards and when i try and make a picture of the phrase in my head it just confuses me because imagining an apple in someone8217s eye doesn8217t have anything to do with liking someone a lot and it makes you forget what the person was talking about my name is a metaphor it means carrying christ and it comes from the greek words cristov which means jesus christ and ferein and it was the name given to st christopher because he carried jesus christ across a river this makes you wonder what he was called before he carried christ across the river but he wasn8217t called anything because this is an apocryphal story which means that it is a lie too mother used to say that it meant christopher was a nice name because it was a story about being kind and helpful but i do not want my name to mean a story about being kind and helpful i want my name to mean me 31 it was 112 am when father arrived at the police station i did not see him until 128 am but i knew he was there because i could hear him he was shouting 8216i want to see my son8217 and 8216why the hell is he locked up8217 and 8216of course i8217m bloody angry8217 then i heard a policeman telling him to calm down then i heard nothing for a long while at 128 am a policeman opened the door of the cell and told me that there was someone to see me i stepped outside father was standing in the corridor he held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan i held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other we do this because sometimes father wants to give me a hug but i do not like hugging people so we do this instead and it means that he loves me then the policeman told us to follow him down the corridor to another room in the room was a table and three chairs he told us to sit down on the far side of the table and he sat down on the other side there was a tape recorder on the table and i asked whether i was going to be interviewed and he was going to record the interview he said 8216i don8217t think there will be any need for that8217 he was an inspector i could tell because he wasn8217t wearing a uniform he also had a very hairy nose it looked as if there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils he said 8216i have spoken to your father and he says that you didn8217t mean to hit the policeman8217 i didn8217t say anything because this wasn8217t a question he said 8216did you mean to hit the policeman8217 i said 8216yes8217 he squeezed his face and said 8216but you didn8217t meant to hurt the policeman8217 i thought about this and said 8216no i didn8217t meant to hurt the policeman i just wanted him to stop touching me8217 then he said 8216you know that it is wrong to hit a policeman don8217t you8217 i said 8216i do8217 he was quiet for a few seconds then he asked 8216did you kill the dog christopher8217 i said 8216i didn8217t kill the dog8217 he said 8216do you know that it is wrong to lie to a policeman and that you can get into a very great deal of trouble if you do8217 i said 8216yes8217 he said 8216so do you know who killed the dog8217 i said 8216no8217 he said 8216are you telling the truth8217 i said 8216yes i always tell the truth8217 and he said 8216right i am going to give you a caution8217 i asked 8216is that going to be on a piece of paper like a certificate i can keep8217 he replied 8216no a caution means that we are going to keep a record of what you did that you hit a policeman but that it was an accident and that you didn8217t mean to hurt the policeman8217 i said 8216but it wasn8217t an accident8217 and father said 8216christopher please8217 the policeman closed his mouth and breathed out loudly through his nose and said 8216if you get into any more trouble we will take out this record and see that you have been given a caution and we will take things much more seriously do you understand what i8217m saying8217 i said that i understood then he said that we could go and he stood up and opened the door and we walked out into the corridor and back to the front desk where i picked up my swiss army knife and my piece of string and the piece of the wooden puzzle and the 3 pellets of rat food for toby and my 163147 and the paperclip and my front door key which were all in a little plastic bag and we went out to father8217s car which was parked outside and we drove home 37 i do not tell lies mother used to say that this was because i was a good person but it is not because i am a good person it is because i can8217t tell lies mother was a small person who smelt nice and she sometimes wore a fleece with a zip down the front which was pink and it had a tiny label which said berghaus on the left bosom a lie is when you say something happened which didn8217t happen but there is only ever one thing which happened at a particular time and a particular place and there are an infinite number of things which didn8217t happen at that time and that place and if i think about something which didn8217t happen i start thinking about all the other things which didn8217t happen for example this morning for breakfast i had ready brek and some hot raspberry milkshake but if i say that i actually had shreddies and a mug of tea i start thinking about cocopops and lemonade and porridge and dr pepper and how i wasn8217t eating my breakfast in egypt and there wasn8217t a rhinoceros in the room and father wasn8217t wearing a diving suit and so on and even writing this makes me feel shaky and scared like i do when i8217m standing on the top of a very tall building and there are thousands of houses and cars and people below me and my head is so full of all these things that i8217m afraid that i8217m going to forget to stand up straight and hang onto the rail and i8217m going to fall over and be killed this is another reason why i don8217t like proper novels because they are lies about things which didn8217t happen and they make me feel shaky and scared and this is why everything i have written here is true
