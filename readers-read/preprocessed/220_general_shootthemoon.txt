 chapter one his early morning flight from los angeles had been delayed for nearly two hours because of fog plenty of time for him to back out just let it all go once he even grabbed his bag and left the terminal but he changed his mind again after boarding he found himself seated next to an elderly woman who was weeping quietly she was still crying when twenty minutes later she offered a whispered apology but he pretended sleep whatever her problem was he didn8217t want to hear it he had no interest in hearing people whine when she left her seat to go to the lavatory he slipped from the firstclass cabin and found an empty row near the back of the plane for a while he tried to read but gave it up when he felt a headache coming on he hadn8217t slept at all the night before hadn8217t even gone to bed instead he8217d spent the hours sitting on his balcony trying to persuade himself not to make this trip then just before five that morning he8217d phoned to make his flight reservation left a vague message on his receptionist8217s answering machine and pulled a suitcase from his closet now with his stomach churning from too much airport coffee his knees wedged against the seat in front of him his body heavy with fatigue he decided that when the plane landed he8217d give this up take the next available flight back to la but he didn8217t after he picked up his rental a mitsubishi eclipse and a map at tulsa international airport he headed east the avis bluechip car the only convertible available wouldn8217t have been his first choice he drove a jaguar xk8 in la but even before he drove out of the city he realized he8217d underestimated the oklahoma heat well over a hundred with humidity so high that his shirt was plastered to his back despite the hot wind the twohour drive took him through mostly empty country the highway skirting towns called coweta tullahassee oktaha8212names that conjured scenes of gene autry movies he arrived in declare before dark then checked into the riverfront motel which looked just a little more inviting than the white buffalo inn at the edge of town or a decrepit hotel called the saddletree a few blocks away his room was about what he expected drab and cramped smaller even than the dorm room he8217d lived in at tufts for five years behind the drapes he found sliding glass doors leading to a balcony that overlooked a river backed by woods of towering pines he didn8217t bother to unpack but he hadn8217t brought much anyway he wasn8217t planning to stick around long the motel restaurant was crowded according to his waitress because it was thursday 8220catfish night8221 she explained managing to turn 8220night8221 into a threesyllable word 8220all you can eat for six ninetyfive8221 8220is it baked8221 he asked a question she thought was hilarious 8220you8217re not an okie are you only one way to fix catfish and that8217s to fry it you want baked fish be here for the sunday buffet we have baked cod then but come before noon 8217cause when the churches let out this place is packed8221 8220i8217ll be gone before sunday8221 8220not staying long huh8221 though he8217d already framed the lie he hesitated another chance to back out 8220i8217m here to look up some old friends of my parents8221 8220who8217s that8221 he felt his heart quicken his breath come short but he was in it now 8220a family named harjo8221 8220which one we got harjos scattered all over this part of the country they8217re all related one way or another ben was the oldest i think8221 8220where can i find him8221 8220he8217s dead but his wife enid lives way the hell out in the boonies can8217t tell you how to get there your best bet is teeve she was married to a harjo he took off years ago but she8217s still close to the family she runs the pool hall on main street8221 after his dinner and with enough fat in his system to grease axle rods he walked to the center of town four depressing blocks scarred by struggle and failure buildings of crumbling native stone many of them empty a boardedup movie theater its marquee advertising a citywide garage sale a bank wearing a new facade the centerpiece a massive clock running an hour late business owners battling the walmart east of town had tried to lure customers back by installing canvas awnings camouflaging peeling paint with cheap brick veneer placing wroughtiron benches on the corner of every block but the awnings were tattered and fading the veneer was flaking paint and the benches were covered with pigeon droppings the pool hall closed by the time he got there didn8217t look as if it were faring any better than other businesses he8217d passed along the way the sign reading teeve8217s place hung crookedly over the door and the plate glass window fronting the building bore a footlong crack patched with caulk and masking tape inside a fluorescent bulb blinked in a tin ceiling pitted with rust the long narrow room was crowded with a makeshift counter pool tables from another era video games vending machines and a game table with four mismatched chairs as he turned and started back toward the motel a mudsplattered pickup drove by a rifle mounted in the back window a confederate flag strapped across the grille two pit bull pups chained in the truck bed if he8217d been back home just then he might have been cussing the traffic clogging the 405 or complaining of the heavy brown air dimming the sun or fighting the panic he felt when a tremor hit but at that moment los angeles seemed like paradise
