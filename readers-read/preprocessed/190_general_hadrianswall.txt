 chapter one no one knows better than i just how big our empire is my bones ache from its immensity i draco am frontiersman and bureaucrat inspector and scribe men fear me for what i represent the long reach of rome i have the ear of emperors i make and break careers i wear this power like armor because its the only protection i have when making my unloved appearances and blunt reports i carry no weapon but authority the cost of this power is exhaustion when i was young traveling romes borders to recommend a strengthened garrison here a tax office there my job seemed glamorous it showed me the world but ive walked ridden barged and sailed for twenty thousand miles and now i am old and weary sent finally to this farthest place my joints sore from its chill i have been ordered to northern britannia to answer a mystery a report on revolt and invasion yes but that is not all of it i read again the dispatch ordering my mission sensing the bafflement behind it a senators daughter lost to the wilderness valeria her name is beautiful by all accounts willful adventuresome discontented the spark that ignited blood and fire why the northern skies outside my window in the grim legionary fortress of eburacum are gray and blank offering nothing i snap at my slave to add more charcoal to the brazier how i miss the sun the tone of the plea ive received from the patrician valens has more of the petulance and selfpity of the endangered politician than it does the heartbreak and guilt of the bereaved father he is one of the two thousand senators who burden todays rome clinging to an office that provides more opportunities for greed than power still a senator cannot be ignored i read again i wish for a public report on the recent barbarian invasion and a confidential addendum on the disappearance of my daughter rumors of her choice have strained relations with my flavian inlaws and interrupted the financial partnership necessary to sustain my office its important that valerias reputation be restored so that her family can make claim to rightful estate i trust you understand the delicacy of your mission and the need for discretion retirement should have come long ago but i am a useful kind of man loyal not to a ruler so much as the idea of rule loyal to stability longevity that means i persist through each change of emperor each switch of state religion each reorganization of the provinces im also kept as far away as possible out on the borders an idealist can be usefully employed but never completely trusted i am here to interrogate survivors which means i try to find some truth in the web of lies selfdeception and wishful thinking that makes up human memory many of the best witnesses are dead and the rest are divided and confused by what happened they carry in their mood the stink of hadrians wall the smell of burned timbers unburied flesh and abandoned food pots that churn with squirming maggots the flies come by day and the wild dogs by night driven off by the desultory crew of sullen slaves crippled soldiers and pressed briton laborers working to repair the damage it is the stink of victory that in truth is a kind of defeat of stability replaced by uncertainty how soon before the barbarians come back again perhaps for good that too the emperor and senate want to know i have made a list of informants to interview the handmaiden the cook the villa owner the captured druid but i start with a soldier direct and blunt the centurion on the field litter before me is named longinus a good record his foot crushed by a battleax in the desperate fighting his eyes dark with sleepless pain and the knowledge he will never walk again still he has glory i can only envy i question him quotdo you know who i amquot quotan imperial inspectorquot quotyou understand my purposequot quotto do the bidding of emperor and senatequot quotyes and yoursquot quotim a man of duty its all ive ever beenquot quotso you will answer any questionquot quotwhen theres an answer i can givequot crisp unhesitating to the point a roman quotgood now you knew the senior tribune galba brassidiasquot quotof coursequot quotwhen he was promotedquot quoti brought the news to himquot quotand when was thatquot quotthe autumn of two years agoquot quotyou were a courierquot longinus is no simple soldier he understands im surprised that a ranking centurion had been assigned the mission of riding the post quotthe news was delicate duke fullofaudes the commander of northern britannia sent me because id campaigned with galba and knew him as well as any man could know him a hard man but a good soldier galba i meanquot quotwhat do you mean a hard manquot quotcavalry not the kind to have at banquet not a conversationalist he was a provincial from thrace who lacked refinement a superb horseman but never schooled solid but grim the best kind to have on your right side in battlequot quotof coursequot as if i truly know quotand he took the news wellquot longinus gave a pained smile remembering quotpoorlyquot quotnone of this will make sense to you unless youve served on the wallquot it is a careful insult an attempt to pretend at a vast difference between civilian and soldier as if a breastplate changes the human heart quoti have spent my whole life on the wallquot i growl giving him a sense of the power behind me quotromes wall from arabia petraea to your dunghill here i have traded insults with the arrogant warriors of sarmatia and sifted rumors of the distant hun i have smelled the stink of berber camels and eaten with sentries on the cold palisades of the rhine counting the fires of the germans across the river do not think you have to tell me about the wallquot quotits just that it wascomplicatedquot quotyou said you would answer any questionquot he shifts grimacing quotill answer it to be honest isnt simple howeverquot quotexplain yourselfquot quotlife at the border is complex sometimes youre a sentry sometimes an ambassador sometimes a wall sometimes a gate sometimes we fight the barbarians sometimes we enlist them for outsiders like the woman to come inquot quotnow you are getting ahead of my questions i asked for galbas reaction to his superiors appointment not his justificationquot longinus hesitates appraising me he doesnt seek to know if i can be trusted how can you ever be sure of that rather whether i can understand the hardest thing in life after all is to be understood quotyouve been to the breach where the barbarians broke throughquot quotit is the first place i went toquot quotwhat did you see therequot the interrogation has been turned around longinus wants proof i can comprehend what he tells me i think before i speak quota thin garrison sulking craftsmen a cold pyre nothing but bonesquot he nods waiting quotthe wall is being repairedquot i go on betraying some of what will be in my report quotbut not with the same care as before i measured the lime and the mix is weak the contractor is corrupt and the imperial foreman untrained his superior died in the fighting the mortar will dry to little better than hard sand and will have to be redonequot quotwill itquot i know what he means the general theodosius has restored rough order but the treasury has been drained and authority is dissipating the best builders are moving south quotit should be redone how well depends on good romans such as yourselfquot he nods quotyoure observant inspector draco realistic smart perhaps smart to have gone to so many places and lived as long as you havequot the centurion has approved of me i realize and im secretly flattered by his approval a man of action seeing value in me a man of words quotmaybe even honest which is rare anymore so ill tell you about galba and the lady valeria and the last good days of the petriana cavalry the patricians will blame him but i dont do youquot i think again quotloyalty is the first virtuequot quotwhich rome did not repay in kindquot that is the question isnt it everyone knows what soldiers owe the state death if necessary but what does the state owe its soldiers quotgalba dedicated his life to rome and then the influence of this woman took his command awayquot longinus goes on quotshe pretended to innocence butquot quotyou do not concede thatquot quotmy experience is that no one is innocent not in rome not here eitherquot innocence is what ive come to decide of course treason jealousy incompetence heroism i pass judgment like a god certainly longinus is right about having to understand hadrians wall in all the empire no place is more remote than this one none farther north none farther west nowhere are the barbarians more intractable the weather gloomier the hills more windswept the poverty more abject i listen my questions sharp but infrequent letting him not just answer but explain i absorb imagine and clarify summarizing in my own mind his story it must have been like this
