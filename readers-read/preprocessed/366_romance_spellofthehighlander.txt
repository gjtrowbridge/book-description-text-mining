 1 friday october 6th the call that changed the entire course of jessi st james8217s life came on an utterly unremarkable dateless friday night that differed in no particularly significant way from any other unremarkable dateless friday night in her alltoopredictable life which8212she was in no hurry to discuss8212were a lot of friday nights she was sitting in the dark on the fire escape outside the kitchen window of her thirdfloor apartment at 222 elizabeth street enjoying an unseasonably warm autumn evening she was being a shameless voyeur peeping around the corner of the brownstone to watch a crowd of people that unlike her had time to have a life and were talking and laughing out on the sidewalk in front of the nightclub across the street for the past few minutes she8217d been riveted by a leggy redhead and her boyfriend8212a darkhaired sunbronzed muscled hottie in jeans and a white tshirt he kept backing his girlfriend up against the wall stretching her hands above her head and kissing her like there was no tomorrow getting into it with his whole gorgeous rippling body and would you just look at that hip action the way he was grinding against her8212they might as well be doing it right there in the street jessi sucked in a sharp breath god had she ever been kissed like that like the man couldn8217t wait to get inside her like he wanted to devour her maybe crawl right inside her skin the redhead8217s hands slipped free down to the hottie8217s ass fingers curving into his muscled butt and jessi8217s hands curled into fists when the hottie8217s hands skimmed up the redhead8217s breasts his thumbs braising her nipples jessi8217s own went hard as little pearls she could almost imagine she was the one he was kissing that she was the one he was about to have hot animalistic8212 why can8217t i have a life like that she thought you can an inner voice reminded8212after your phd the reminder wasn8217t nearly as effective as it had been years ago as an undergrad she was sick of being in school sick of being broke sick of constantly racing from her classes to her fulltime job as professor keene8217s assistant then home to study or if she was really lucky snatching a whopping four or five hours of sleep before getting up to do it all over again her demanding tightly organized schedule left no time for a social life and lately she8217d been feeling downright sulky about it everywhere she turned lately there were couples and they were busy coupling and having a wonderfully couplelicious time of it but not her there was no time for coupling in her life she wasn8217t one of the lucky ones that had a free ride through school she had to scrimp and save and make every moment and penny count in addition to working fulltime and taking a full load of classes she taught classes too it barely left her time to eat shower and sleep on the infrequent occasions she8217d tried to date the guys had gotten so fed up with how seldom she could see them and how low on her list of priorities they seemed to be and how unwilling she was to fall right in bed with them most college guys seemed to think if they didn8217t score by the third date there was something wrong with the woman8212puhleeze that they8217d soon sought greener pastures still it would all be worth it soon although some people didn8217t seem to think being an archaeologist and playing with old dusty or frequently dead things for the rest of one8217s life was a particularly exciting thing to do like her mom who hated jessi8217s choice of major and couldn8217t understand why she wasn8217t married and blissfully popping out babies like her sisters jessi couldn8217t imagine a more thrilling career it might not top other people8217s lists of dreams but it was hers dr jessica st james she was so close she could taste it another year and a half and she8217d be done with her course work for her phd then she might date like the energizer bunny making up for lost time but right now she8217d not worked so hard and gone into so much debt to go screwing everything up just because she seemed to be stuck in some kind of hormonal overdrive in a few years she consoled herself staring down at the busy street the people hanging out at that club would probably still be hanging out at that club their lives completely unchanged while she would be traveling to faroff places digging up remnants of the past and having grand adventures and who knew maybe mr right would be waiting for her out there at some future dig site maybe her life just wasn8217t scheduled to take off as fast as everyone else8217s maybe she was just a late bloomer holy cow8212the hottie was slipping his hand inside the redhead8217s jeans and her hand was on his8212oh right there in front of god and everybody behind her somewhere in the cramped and crowded apartment that desperately needed to be cleaned and have the trash taken out the phone began to ring jessi rolled her eyes the mundaneness of her existence always chose the most inconvenient moments to intrude ring ring she gulped another fascinated look at the unabashed display of sexonthesidewalk then reluctantly boosted herself inside the kitchen window she shook her head in a vain attempt to clear it then pulled down the shade what she couldn8217t see couldn8217t torture her at least not much anyway riiiiing where was that blasted phone she finally spied it on the sofa nearly buried beneath pillows candy wrappers and a pizza box that contained8212eew8212something fuzzy and phosphorescent green as she gingerly pushed aside the box she hesitated hand suspended in midair above the phone for a moment8212the briefest most peculiar of interludes8212she suffered the inexplicable intense feeling that she shouldn8217t pick it up that she should just let it ring and ring maybe let it ring all weekend later jessi would recall that feeling time itself seemed to stand still for that odd pregnant slice of time and she had the weirdest sensation that the universe itself had stopped breathing and was waiting to see what she would do next she wrinkled her nose at the ridiculous egocentric thought as if the universe ever even noticed jessi st james she picked up the phone lucan myrddin trevayne paced before the fire when employing a sorcerer8217s spell to conceal his true appearance8212which he did whenever he wasn8217t completely alone8212he was tall in his early forties handsome powerfully built his thick black hair dashed at the temples with silver he was a man who turned women8217s heads and made men take an instinctive step back when he walked by his mien said one thing power8212i have it you don8217t and if you think you do8212try me his features were old world his eyes cold gray as a loch beneath a stormy sky his true appearance was far less appealing he8217d amassed tremendous wealth and power in his lifetime which had been considerably longer than most he held controlling interest in many and varied enterprises from banks to media to oil he kept residences in a dozen cities he retained a select group of uniquely trained men and the occasional woman to handle his most private affairs to his left seated in a deep armchair one of those men waited tensely 8220this is absurd roman8221 lucan growled 8220what the hell8217s taking so long8221 roman shifted defensively in his chair he was aptly named his features as classically handsome as those on an ancient coin his hair long and blond 8220i8217ve got men on it mr trevayne8221 he said with the trace of a russian accent 8220the best men we8217ve got the problem is they went in a dozen different directions they were sold on the black market no one has names it8217s going to take time82128221 8220time is the one thing i don8217t have8221 lucan cut him off sharply 8220every hour every moment that passes makes it less likely they8217ll be recovered those damned things must be found8221 8220those damned things8221 were the dark or 8220unseelie8221 hallows of the tuatha d233 danaan8212artifacts of immense power created by an ancient civilization that had passed centuries ago and quite erroneously into man8217s history books as a mythical race the daoine sidhe or the fae lucan had believed there was no better place to safekeep his prized treasures than in his wellwarded private residence in london he8217d been wrong critically wrong he wasn8217t certain what had happened a few months ago while he8217d been out of the country pursuing a lead on the dark book the final and most powerful of the four unseelie hallows but something had transpired somewhere in london8212its epicenter in the east side he could feel the lingering traces of power8212that had reverberated through all of england an immense and ancient power had risen for a brief time so strong that it had neutralized all other magic in britain which he wouldn8217t have cared about since whatever it was had departed as swiftly as it had come except for the fact that its rising had shattered formidable allegedly unbreakable wards that protected his most prized possessions protected them so well that he8217d found the notion of a modernday security system laughable not so laughable now he8217d had a stateoftheart system installed with cameras in every room sweeping every angle because while he8217d been away a thief had broken into his museum of a home and stolen artifacts that had belonged to him for centuries8212including his irreplaceable hallows the box amulet and mirror fortunately the thief had been spotted by neighbors while hauling away his loot unfortunately by the time lucan8217s select staff had managed to identify and track the bastard he8217d already sold the artifacts to the first in a series of elusive middlemen artifacts such as his fabulous and utterly lacking provenance inevitably ended up in one of two places with the legal authorities of one country or another after being intercepted in transit or sold for a fraction of their worth on the black market before disappearing sometimes for hundreds of years before so much as a whispered rumor was heard of them again they8217d gotten few names8212and those obvious aliases8212from the thief before he8217d died for months now lucan8217s men had been chasing a deliberately and cunningly muddied trail and time was growing critical 8220 though we8217ve recovered three of the manuscripts and one of the swords we8217ve learned nothing about the box or amulet but it looks like we might have a solid lead on the mirror8221 roman was saying lucan stiffened the mirror the dark glass was the one hallow he needed urgently of all the years it might have been stolen it8217d had to be this one when the tithe was due the other dark hallows could wait a bit longer though not long they were far too dangerous to have loose in the world each of the hallows conferred a gift upon its possessor for a price if the possessor had the knowledge and the power to use it the mirror8217s dark gift was immortality so long as he met its conditions he8217d been meeting its conditions for over a thousand years now he intended to continue 8220a shipment rumored to fit the bill left england for the states via ireland a few days ago we believe it8217s headed for some university in chicago to a82128221 8220then why the fuck are you still sitting here8221 lucan said coldly 8220if you have a lead any lead at all on the glass i want you on it personally now8221 it was imperative he recover the mirror before samhain or else that 8220or else8221 was a thing he refused to contemplate the mirror would be found the tithe paid a small quantity of pure gold passed through the glass every one hundred years8212in the old ones way of marking time which was more than a century by modern standards at precisely midnight on samhain or halloween as the current century called it twentysix days from today the century8217s tithe was due twentysix days from today the mirror must be in his possession8212or the compact binding his captive to it would be broken as the blond man gathered his coat and gloves lucan reiterated his position where the dark hallows were concerned 8220no witnesses roman anyone who8217s caught so much as even a glimpse of one of the hallows 8221 roman inclined his head in silent concurrence lucan said no more there was no need roman knew how he liked things handled as did all who worked for him and continued to live some time later shortly after midnight jessi was back on campus for the third time that day in the south wing of the archaeology department unlocking professor keene8217s office she wondered wryly why she even bothered leaving given the hours she kept she8217d be better off tucking a cot into that stuffy forgotten janitor8217s closet down the hall amid mops and brooms and pails that hadn8217t been used in years she8217d not only get more sleep she8217d save on gas money too when the professor had called her from the hospital to tell her that he8217d been in a 8220bit of a fender bender8221 on his way back to campus82128220a few inconvenient fractures and contusions not to worry8221 he8217d assured her swiftly8212she8217d been expecting him to ask her to pick up his classes for the next few days meaning her sleep window would dwindle from four or five hours to a great big fat nil but he8217d informed her he8217d already called mark troudeau and arranged for him to take his classes until he returned i8217ve a wee favor to ask of you though jessica i8217ve a package coming i was to accept a delivery at my office this evening he8217d told her in his deep voice that even after twentyfive years away from county louth ireland had never lost its lilt she loved that lilt couldn8217t wait to one day hear a whole pub speaking it while she washed down a hearty serving of soda bread and irish stew with a perfectly poured guinness after of course having spent an entire day in the national museum of ireland delightedly poring over such fabulous treasures as the tara brooch the ardagh chalice and the broighter gold collection hugging the phone between ear and shoulder she8217d glanced at her watch the luminous dial indicating ten minutes past ten what kind of package gets delivered so late at night she8217d wondered aloud you needn8217t concern yourself with that just sign for it lock it up and go home that8217s all i need of course professor but what8212 just sign lock it up and forget about it jessica a pause a weighty silence then i see no reason to mention this to anyone it8217s personal not university business she8217d blinked startled she8217d never heard such a tone in the professor8217s voice before words sharply clipped he8217d sounded defensive almost well paranoid i understand i8217ll take care of it you just rest professor don8217t you worry about a thing she8217d soothed hastily deciding that whatever pain meds he was getting were making him funny the poor dear she8217d once had tylenol with codeine that had made her feel itchy all over shorttempered and irritable with multiple fractures it was a sure bet he8217d been given something stronger than tylenol 3 now standing beneath the faintly buzzing fluorescent lights in the university hallway she rubbed her eyes and yawned hugely she was exhausted she8217d gotten up at sixfifteen for a seventwenty class and by the time she got home tonight8212er this morning8212and managed to fall back into bed she would have put in another twentyhour day again tuning the key in the lock she pushed open the office door fumbled for the light switch and flipped it on she inhaled as she stepped into the professor8217s office savoring the scholarly blend of books and leather fine wood polish and the pungent aroma of his favorite pipe tobacco she planned to one day have an office of her own very much like it the spacious room had builtin floortoceiling bookcases and tall windows that during the day spilled sun across an intricately woven antique rug of wine russet and amber the teakandmahogany furniture was formally masculine a stately clawfoot desk a sumptuous leather chesterfield sofa in a deep burnished coffeebean hue companion wing chairs there were numerous glasspaned curio cabinets and occasional tables displaying his most prized replica pieces a reproduction tiffany lamp graced his desk only his computer with its twentyoneinch flat screen belied the century remove it and she might have been standing in the library of a nineteenthcentury english manor house 8220in here8221 she called over her shoulder to the deliverymen the package hadn8217t turned out to be quite what she8217d expected from the way the professor had spoken of it she8217d imagined a bulky envelope perhaps a small parcel but the 8220package8221 was actually a crate and a huge one at that it was tall wide about the size of a well a sarcophagus or something and proving no easy matter to navigate through the university corridors 8220careful man tilt it tilt it ow you8217re smashing my finger back it up and angle it8221 a muttered 8220sorry8221 more grunting 8220damn thing8217s awkward hall8217s too frigging narrow8221 8220you8217re almost here8221 jessi offered helpfully 8220just a bit farther8221 indeed moments later they were carefully lowering the oblong box from their shoulders depositing it on the rug 8220the professor said i needed to sign something8221 she encouraged them to hurry she had a full day of working and studying tomorrow er today 8220lady we need more than that this here package don8217t get left 8217til it8217s verified8221 8220 8216verified82178221 she echoed 8220what does that mean8221 8220means it8217s worth bookoo bucks and the shipper8217s insurer8217s got to have visual verification and release see says so right here8221 the beefier of the two thrust a clipboard at her 8220don8217t care who does it lady so long as somebody8217s john hancock8217s on my paperwork8221 sure enough visual verification and release required was stamped in red across the bill of lading followed by two pages of terms and definitions detailing shipper8217s and buyer8217s rights in pedantic inflated legal jargon she pushed a hand through her short dark curls sighing the professor wasn8217t going to like this he8217d said it was personal 8220and if i don8217t let you open it up and inspect it8221 8220goes back lady and let me tell you the shipper8217s gonna be plenty pissed8221 8220yeah8221 said the other man 8220thing cost an arm and a leg to insure goes back your professor8217s gonna have to pay the second time around i bet he8217s gonna be plenty pissed too8221 they stared at her with flat challenging gazes clearly disinclined to wrestle the awkward crate back up on their shoulders squeeze it back down the hall reload it and return it only to end up delivering it again they weren8217t even talking to her breasts a thing men often did especially the first time they met her which told her how deadly earnest they were about dumping their load and getting on with their lives she glanced at the phone she glanced at her watch she hadn8217t gotten the professor8217s room number and suspected that if she called the main desk they8217d never put her through at this hour though he8217d insisted he wasn8217t badly hurt she knew the doctors wouldn8217t have kept him if he hadn8217t been seriously injured hospitals these days spit people out as fast as they took them in would the professor be more upset if she opened it8212or if she refused the delivery and it cost him a fortune to have it reshipped she sighed again feeling damned if she did and damned if she didn8217t in the end it was the constantlybroke college student in her who flipped the coin and made the call 8220fine let8217s do this open it up8221 twenty minutes later the deliverymen had secured her wearily scribbled signature and were gone taking the remains of the crating with them and now she stood eyeing the thing curiously it wasn8217t a sarcophagus after all in fact most of the packaging had been padding from deep within layers and layers of cushioned wrapping they8217d unearthed a mirror and at her direction propped it carefully against the east wall of bookshelves taller than she by more than a foot the mirror8217s ornate frame was a shimmery gold shapes and symbols of such uniformity and cohesion to imply a system of writing were carved into every inch of the wide border she narrowed her eyes pondering the etchings but linguistics was not her specialty and the symbols were nothing that without searching through books or notes she could identify as a letter word or glyph inside the gaudy gilt frame the outer edges of the silvery glass were marred with a cloudy uneven black stain of some sort but aside from that the glass itself was startlingly clear she suspected it had been broken and replaced at some point and would ultimately prove centuries younger than the frame no mirror of yore had achieved such clarity though the earliest artificial mirrors discovered by archaeologists dated back to 6200 bce they had been fashioned of polished obsidian not glass the first glass mirrors of significant size8212roughly threebyfivefoot panels8212hadn8217t been manufactured until the 16808217s by italian glassmaker bernard perroto for the hall of mirrors at versailles commissioned by the extravagant sun king louis the xiv exceptional glass mirrors of the size of the one before her8212an impressive six and a half feet tall8212generally proved to be a few hundred years old at most considering this one8217s pristine silvering it was likely less than a century in age and no one had gone mad or died from slow mercury poisoning making it hatmakers or 8220hatters8221 hadn8217t been the only ones to suffer from the toxic fumes of their trade though for some reason jessi8217d never been able to figure the idiom 8220madasamirrormaker8221 had never quite caught on eyes narrowed thoughtfully she scrutinized it the archaeologist in her itched to know the piece8217s provenance wondered if the frame had been accurately dated she frowned what did the professor want with a mirror anyway such an item wasn8217t at all in keeping with his usual tastes which ran toward replica weapons and reproductions of ancient timepieces such as the sixteenthcentury german astrolabe adorning his desk and how could the professor possibly afford something worth 8220bookoo bucks8221 on his teaching salary anyway fishing the key from the pocket of her jeans she turned to leave she8217d done as he8217d asked her work here was finished she flipped off the light and was just stepping through the doorway when she felt a chill all the fine hair at the nape of her neck lifted tingling as if electrified her heart was abruptly pounding against the wall of her chest and she felt the sudden terrifying certainty that she was being watched in the manner that prey was watched flinching she turned back toward the mirror dimly illumed by the pale blue glow of the computer8217s screen saver the artifact looked positively eerie the gold appeared silvery the silver glass smoky dark and deep with shadows and in those shadows something moved she sucked in a breath so fast she choked on it sputtering she groped for the light switch overhead light blazed down flooding the room she stared into the oblong glass a hand pressed to her throat swallowing convulsively her reflection stared back after a moment she closed her eyes snapped them open stared into the glass again just her the hair at her nape continued to bristle icy chills rippled up her spine the pulse at the hollow of her neck fluttered frantically beneath her palm eyes wide she glanced uneasily around the room the professor8217s office precisely as it should be after a long moment she tried for a laugh but it came out shaky uncertain and seemed to echo unpleasantly in the office8212as if the room8217s square footage and actual occupyable space didn8217t quite coincide 8220jessi you8217re losing it8221 she whispered there was nothing no one with her in the professor8217s office but her overactive imagination with a dismissive toss of her head she turned flipped off the light again and this time pulled the door shut behind her hard and fast and without a backward glance hurrying down the corridor she dashed out into the back parking lot kicking up a swirl of red and gold leaves as she hastened to her car the more distance she put between herself and the building the more ridiculous she felt8212really getting all spooked alone on campus at night one day she would be working on excavations in the middle of nowhere quite likely late at night and sometimes alone she couldn8217t afford to be fanciful at times though it was hard not to be especially when holding a twentyfivehundredyearold druid brooch or examining a fabulously detailed la t232ne period sword certain relics seemed to carry lingering traces of energy the residue of the passionate lives of those who8217d touched them though not anything like what she thought she8217d just seen 8220how weird was that8217 she muttered shaking off a lingering shiver 8220god i really must have sex on the brain8221 watching the hottie and his girlfriend earlier had apparently done quite a number on her that coupled with exhaustion and the low lighting she decided firmly as she unlocked her car and slipped behind the wheel must have pushed her over the edge into a brief eyeswideopen kind of hallucinationfantasy because for a moment she actually thought she8217d seen a halfnaked man8212an absolute sexgod of a man no less8212standing in keene8217s office looking back at her a trick of the light strange shadows falling nothing more a towering muscleripped darkly beautiful man dripping power and hunger and sex the kind of sex nice girls didn8217t have oh honey you so need to get a boyfriend looking at her like she was little red riding hood and the big bad wolf hadn8217t been fed in a long long time definitely a trick of the light looking at her from inside the mirror in a place that was not a place yet was place enough to serve as an inescapable fortress prison a place to terrify to drive the common man stark raving mad six feet five inches of caged ninthcentury highlander stirred a hungry animal sound rumbled deep in his throat just as he8217d thought he smelled woman
