 chapter 1 eyeworth manor near fritham in the new forest hampshire late june 1825 wife wife wife wife michael anstrutherwetherby swore beneath his breath that refrain had plagued him for the last twentyfour hours when hed driven away from amelia cynsters wedding breakfast it had run to the rhythm of his curricles wheels now it was playing to the steady clop of his bay geldings hooves lips setting he wheeled atlas out of the stableyard and set out along the drive circling his home if he hadnt gone to cambridgeshire to attend amelias wedding hed already be one step closer to being an affianced man but the wedding had been one event he hadnt even thought of missing aside from the fact his sister honoria duchess of st ives had been the hostess the wedding had been a family gathering and he valued family ties familial links had helped him immeasurably in recent years first in gaining his position as member of parliament for this district and subsequently in forging his path upward through the ranks yet that wasnt the wellspring of his appreciation family had always meant a great deal to him rounding his house a sturdy threestoried manor house built of grey stone his gaze went as it always did when he passed this way to the monument that stood on the verge halfway between the house and the gates set against the darkleaved shrubs filling the gaps beneath the tall trees the simple stone had stood for fourteen years it marked the spot where his family his parents and younger brother and sister racing home in a curricle in the teeth of a storm had been killed by a falling tree he and honoria had witnessed the accident from the schoolroom windows high above perhaps it was simply human nature to value highly something one had lost left shocked grieving and adrift he and honoria had still had each other but with him barely nineteen and her sixteen theyd had to part theyd never lost touch they were even now close but honoria had since met devil cynster she now had a family of her own slowing atlas as he approached the stone michael was acutely aware he did not his life was full to bursting his schedule perennially crammed it was only in moments like this that the lack shone so clearly and loneliness jabbed he paused studying the stone then jaw setting faced forward and flicked the reins atlas picked up his pace passing through the gates michael held him to a steady canter along the narrow lane the nightmarish sound of horses screaming slowly faded today he was determined to take the first step toward establishing a family of his own wife wife wife wife the countryside closed around him embraced him in its lush green arms welcomed him into the woods and forests that to him were the essence of home sunlight flickered glimmered through shifting leaves birds called and twittered beyond the rustle of the canopies there was no other sound to punctuate the clop of atlass hooves narrow and winding the lane led nowhere but to the manor joining a wider road that led south to lyndhurst not far from that junction another lane wended east to the village of bramshaw and bramshaw house his destination hed decided on his course some months ago but once again government concerns had demanded his attention and hed let matters slidewhen hed realized hed pulled himself up short sat down and laid out a schedule despite the distraction of amelias wedding hed stuck rigidly to his selfimposed timetable and left the wedding breakfast in good time to drive down here to his necessary destiny leaving somersham in midafternoon hed stopped with a friend at basingstoke overnight he hadnt mentioned his reason for heading home yet it had weighed preyed on his mind hed set out early and arrived home midmorning it was now two oclock and he was determined to delay no longer the die would be cast the matter if not finished with then at least begun halfway arranged a constituency matter you might say that amelias question his answer perfectly true in its way to a sitting member one whod reached the age of thirtythree unwed and been informed he was being considered for advancement into the ministry marriage was definitely a quotconstituency matterquot he accepted he had to marry indeed hed always assumed he would someday how else was he to establish the family he craved yet the years had rolled by and hed become caught up in his developing career and through that and his close links with the cynsters and the haut ton increasingly cognizant of the breadth of experience the state of marriage encompassed hed become less and less inclined to pursue it now however his time had come when parliament had risen for the summer hed been left in no doubt that the prime minister expected him to return in autumn with a wife on his arm thereby enabling his name to be considered in the cabinet reshuffle widely tipped to occur at that time since april hed been actively seeking his ideal bride the peace of the countryside wrapped him about the wife wife wife refrain remained but its tone grew less compulsive the closer he got to his goal it had been easy to define the qualities and attributes he required in his bride passable beauty loyalty supportive abilities such as hostessly talents and some degree of intelligence lightened with a touch of humor finding such a paragon proved another matter after spending hours in the ballrooms hed concluded hed be wiser to seek a bride with some understanding of a politicians life even better a successful politicians life then hed met elizabeth mollison or rather remet her for strictly speaking hed known her all her life her father geoffrey mollison owned bramshaw house and had been the previous member for the district brought low by his wifes unexpected death geoffrey had resigned the seat just as michael had approached the party with his grandfather magnus anstrutherwetherbys and the cynsters backing it had seemed a stroke of fate geoffrey a conscientious man had been relieved to be able to hand the reins to someone he knew even though he and geoffrey were from different generations and markedly different in character namely in ambition hed always found geoffrey encouraging always ready to help he hoped hed help now and support his notion of marrying elizabeth she was in his estimation remarkably close to his ideal true she was young nineteen but she was also wellbred wellgroomed and unquestionably wellbroughtup and so he judged capable of learning all she needed to know she was a very english beauty with pale blond hair and blue eyes a fine complexion and a slender figure wellsuited to the current fashions most importantly however she had grown up in a political house even after her mother had died and geoffrey had retired from the fray elizabeth had been placed in the care of her aunt augusta lady cunningham who was married to a senior diplomat even more her younger aunt caroline had been married to the british ambassador to portugal elizabeth had spent time at the embassy in lisbon under her aunt caros wing elizabeth had lived all her life in political and diplomatic households he was perfectly certain shed know how to manage his and of course marrying her would strengthen his admittedly already strong position locally that wasnt something to sneeze at given that by all accounts in future hed be spending much of his time on international affairs a wife who could be relied on to keep the home fires stoked would be a godsend mentally he rehearsed what he would say to geoffrey he did not yet wish to make a formal offer for elizabeths hand he needed to get to know her better and allow her to get to know him but given the connection between himself and the mollisons he deemed it wise to sound geoffrey out no sense in proceeding if he was set against it michael doubted that would be the case but it wouldnt hurt to ask to keep geoffrey firmly in his camp if over two or three meetings elizabeth proved as pleasant and amenable as shed appeared in town they could progress to an offer and thence to the altar all in good time for autumn coldblooded perhaps yet in his opinion a marriage based on mutual affection rather than passion would suit him best despite his links with the cynsters he did not consider himself as one with them when it came to marriage he was a different sort of man they were passionate determined highhandedly arrogant he would admit to being determined but hed long ago learned to disguise his arrogance and he was a politician ergo not a man given to the wilder passions not a man to allow his heart to rule his head a straightforward marriage to a lady close to his ideal that was what he needed hed discussed the prospect and specifically elizabeth mollison with his grandfather and also with his aunt mrs harriet jennet a political hostess of note both had supported his stance in both cases with typical anstrutherwetherby ascerbity harriet had snorted quotglad to see honoria and that lot havent turned your head the position of your wife is too important to be decided by the color of a ladys eyesquot he doubted that the color of a ladys eyes had ever featured highly in any male cynsters mind as a deciding factor in marriage other physical attributes perhapsof course hed held his tongue magnus had made various stringent comments about the unwisdom of allowing passion to rule ones life strangely however although almost daily prodding him to get on with the business of securing elizabeths hand at amelias wedding at somersham magnus had ignored the perfect opportunity to pressthen again history had it that all weddings celebrated at somersham place were lovematches perhaps it was that that the marriage he was set on indeed needed to be set on would not be one such that had persuaded his grandfather to cling to wisdom and in that company hold his tongue the lane wended on a strange impatience rose within him but he held atlas to his steady pace ahead the trees thinned beyond glimpsed through their trunks and the thick undergrowth he could see the rippling fields lining the lyndhurst lane a feeling of certainty gripped him it was the right time for him to go forward and marry to build another family here the next generation to put down deeper roots and grow into the next phase of his life the lane was a succession of curves the trees and undergrowth thick enough to screen sounds at any distance by the time the rattle of the fast approaching carriage the thud of flying hooves reached him the carriage was almost upon him he just had time to draw atlas to the side of the lane before a gig out of control and careening wildly exploded around the bend it flashed past heading toward the manor grimfaced pale as death a slim woman wrestled with the reins desperately trying to control the horse michael cursed and wheeled atlas he was thundering in the gigs wake before hed even thought then he did and cursed again carriage accidents were his worst nightmare the threat of witnessing another sank like a spur into his side he urged atlas on the gig was rocketing almost flying the horse would soon tire but the lane led only to the manor and that would be reached too soon hed been born at the manor had lived his first nineteen years there he knew every foot of the lane atlas was fresh dropping the reins he rode with hands and knees they were gaining but not enough soon the lane would become the drive which ended in a sharp turn into the forecourt before the manor steps the horse would take the curve the gig wouldnt it would overturn the lady would be thrownonto the rocks edging the front beds inwardly cursing he pushed atlas on the big gelding responded stretching out legs flashing as they gained inch by inch on the wildly rocking gig they were almost alongside the gates flashed up then were behind no more time gathering himself michael sprang from the saddle to the gig he caught the seat dragged himself half over it lunging across the lady he grabbed the reins and yanked hard the lady screamed so did the horse michael hung on with all his strength hauled back there was no time no drive left to worry about anything but halting the horse hooves skidded the horse screamed again swung sideways and halted michael grabbed the brake too late momentum whipped the gig around pure luck kept it upright the lady was flung out of the gig onto the grassy verge he was thrown after her she landed face down he sprawled half atop her for an instant he couldnt move couldnt draw breath couldnt think reactions dozens poured through him the slender fragile body trapped beneath his delicate yet elementally womanly sent protectiveness flaring only to trigger horror and nascent fury over what had so nearly transpired over what had been risked then fear welled black roiling irrational and old dark and deep it swelled gripped hard strangled all else hooves shifted on the gravel he looked around the horse blowing hard tried to walk but the gig dragged the horse stopped atlas had halted on the other side of the lawn and stood watching ears pricked quotooofquot beneath him the lady struggled his shoulder lay across her back his hips anchoring her thighs she couldnt move until he did he rolled back sat up his gaze fell on the stone monument two yards away the terror of screaming horses filled his mind jaw setting he drew in a tight breath and got to his feet watched grimfaced as the lady pushed back then swung around to sit he reached down grabbed her hands hauled her unceremoniously to her feet quotof all the stupid witlessquot he broke off fought to shackle his temper soaring on the wings of that roiling irrational fear lost the battle hands rising to his hips he glared at its cause quotif you cant handle the reins you shouldnt be drivingquot he snapped the words out didnt care if they cut quotyou came within yards of serious injury if not deathquot for an instant he wondered if she was deaf she gave no indication shed heard him caroline sutcliffe dusted her gloved hands and thanked her stars shed worn gloves ignoring the solid lump of male reverberating with aggravation before her she had no idea who he was she hadnt yet seen his face she shook out her skirts inwardly grimaced at the grass stains then straightened the bodice the sleeves her gauzy scarf and finally consented to look up and up he was taller than shed thought wider of shoulder toothe physical shock when hed appeared beside her in the gig compounded when hed landed atop her on the grass flashed back into her mind she thrust it out again quotthank you sir whoever you are for your rescue however ungraciousquot her tone would have done a duchess credit cool confident assured and haughty precisely the right tone to use on a presumptuous male quothoweverquot her rising gaze reached his face she blinked the sun was behind him she stood in full light but his face was shadowed lifting her hand she shaded her eyes and unabashedly peered at a strongfeatured face with a square jaw and the harsh angular planes of her own class a patrician face with a wide brow delimited by straight dark brows over eyes memory painted a soft blue his hair was thick dark brown the silver tracery at his temples only made him more distinguished it was a face that held a great deal of character it was the face shed come there to find she tilted her head quotmichael it is michael anstrutherwetherby isnt itquot michael stared at a heart shaped face surrounded by a nimbus of fine sheening brown hair so light it was flyaway puffed soft as a dandelion crown about her head at eyes silverblue slightly tiptilted quotcaroquot the name came to his lips without real thought she smiled up at him clearly delighted for one instant he all of him stilled the screaming horses abruptly fell silent quotyes its been years since weve spokenquot her gaze grew vague as she cast her mind back quotat camdens funeralquot he reminded her her late husband camden sutcliffe a legend in diplomatic circles had been his majestys ambassador to portugal caro had been sutcliffes third wife she refocused on his face quotyoure right two years agoquot quoti havent seen you about townquot he had however heard of her the diplomatic corps had dubbed her the merry widow quothow are you faringquot quotvery well thank you camden was a good man and i miss him butquot she shrugged lightly quotthere were more than forty years between us so it was always going to be this wayquot the horse shifted ineffectually dragging the braked gig recalled to the present they both went forward caro held the horses head while he untangled the reins then checked the harness he frowned quotwhat happenedquot quoti have no ideaquot frowning too caro stroked the horses nose quoti was coming from a ladies association meeting at fordinghamquot the crisp clop of hooves had them both glancing toward the gates a gig came trotting smartly through the large lady driving saw them waved then briskly steered the gig toward them quotmuriel insisted i attend the meeting you know how she isquot caro spoke quickly beneath the rattle of the gigs approach quotshe offered to drive me but i decided if i was traveling all that way i would use the trip to call on lady kirkwright so i drove over early then attended the meeting and muriel and i drove back in tandemquot michael understood all she was telling him muriel was camdens niece caros niecebymarriage although muriel was seven years the elder she too had grown up in bramshaw unlike the pair of them muriel had never left born and raised at sutcliffe hall at the far end of the village she now lived in the village center in hedderwick house her husbands residence a stones throw from the drive of bramshaw house caros family home more to the point muriel had elected herself the organizer of the parish a role shed filled for years although her manner was often overbearing everyone themselves included bore with her managing disposition for the simple reason that she did a necessary job well with a stylish flourish muriel brought her gig to a halt in the forecourt she was handsome in a mannish way undeniably striking with her upright carriage and dark hair she stared at caro quotgreat heavens caro were you thrown youve grass stains on your gown are you all rightquot her tone was faint as if she couldnt quite credit her eyes quotthe way you took off i never would have believed youd succeed in reining henry inquot quoti didntquot caro waved at michael quotluckily michael was riding out he bravely leapt into the gig and performed the necessary featquot michael met her eyes saw the lurking gracefully grateful smile managed not to smile in return quotthank goodness for thatquot muriel turned to him nodding in greeting quotmichael i didnt know youd returnedquot quoti arrived this morning have you any idea why henry bolted ive checked reins and harness there doesnt seem to be any obvious causequot muriel frowned at henry quotno caro and i were driving home together then caro turned into your lane and waved she was just a little way along when henry started thenquot muriel gestured quotoff he wentquot she looked at caro who nodded quotyes it happened just like thatquot she stroked henrys nose quotwhich is strange hes normally a placid beast i drive him whenever im homequot quotwell next time we meet at fordingham ill take you up with me you may be surequot muriel widened her eyes quoti nearly had palpitations i expected to come upon you bloody and brokenquot caro made no direct answer frowning she studied henry quotsomething must have startled himquot quotpossibly a stagquot muriel gathered her reins quotthe bushes are so thick along that stretch its impossible to see what may be lurkingquot quottruequot caro nodded quotbut henry would have knownquot quotindeed but now youre safe i must get onquot muriel glanced at michael quotwe were discussing arrangements for the church fete and i must make a start i assume youll be attendingquot he smiled easily quotof coursequot he made a mental note to learn when the fete was quotmy regards to hedderwick and george if you see himquot muriel inclined her head quotill pass your wishes onquot she exchanged a gracious nod with caro then eyed caros gig presently blocking the exit from the forecourt michael glanced at caro quotlets take henry to the stables ill have hardacre examine him see if he can suggest anything to account for his startquot quotan excellent notionquot caro waited while he reached over and released the gigs brake then she waved to muriel and led henry forward michael checked that the gig was undamaged and the wheels rolling freely once it cleared the forecourt he saluted muriel with a regal nod she trotted her horse past and around toward the gates he turned to follow caro atlas was still standing patiently he clicked his fingers and the bay ambled up catching the reins he wound them about one hand then lengthened his stride coming up on henrys other side he looked across at caro at the section of her face he could see over the horses head her hair glimmered and shimmered in the sunshine totally unfashionable yet it appeared so soft it simply begged to be touched quotare you fixed at bramshaw house for the summerquot she glanced at him quotfor the momentquot she patted henry quoti move around between geoffrey here and augusta in derby and angela in berkshire i have the house in london but i havent yet reopened itquot he nodded geoffrey was her brother augusta and angela her sisters but caro was the baby the youngest by many years he glanced at her again she was murmuring soothingly to henry a peculiar disorientation still gripped him as if he were slightly offbalance and it had to do with her he knew her yet didnt when theyd briefly met two years ago shed been recently bereaved draped in widows weeds and heavily veiled theyd exchanged a few murmured words but he hadnt truly seen or spoken with her prior to that shed spent the previous decade or so in lisbon hed occasionally glimpsed her across ballrooms or crossed her path when she and camden were in london but had never shared more than the usual social pleasantries there were only five years between them yet although theyd known each other since childhood and had spent their formative years growing up in this restricted area of the new forest he didnt truly know her at all he certainly didnt know the elegant and assured lady shed become she looked at him caught him looking at her and smiled easily as if acknowledging a mutual curiosity the temptation to assuage it grew she looked forward he followed her gaze summoned by the crunch of the gigs wheels hardacre his stableman had come out of the stable michael beckoned hardacre came over bobbing a deferential greeting to caro who returned it with his name and one of her serene smiles while they walked the gig into the stableyard he and she explained what had happened frowning hardacre ran knowledgable eyes over both horse and gig then scratched his balding pate quotbest leave him with me for an hour or so ill unharness and check him over see if theres some problemquot michael looked at caro quotare you in a hurry i could lend you a gig and horse if you arequot quotno noquot she waved aside the offer with a smile quotan hour of peace would be welcomequot he recalled reached solicitously for her arm quotwould you care for teaquot quotthat would be delightfulquot caro smiled more definitely as he settled her hand on his sleeve with a nod for hardacre she let michael steer her toward the house her nerves were still flickering twitching hardly surprising yet the panic of being in a runaway gig was already fading who could have predicted that near disaster would turn out so well quotis mrs entwhistle still your housekeeperquot quotyes none of the staff have changed not for yearsquot she looked ahead at the solid stone house with its gabled roof and dormer windows they were walking through an orchard the dappled shade sweet with the scent of swelling fruit between that and the back door lay a rambling herb garden bisected by a flagged path to the left beyond a low wall lay the kitchen garden quotbut thats what draws us back isnt itquot she glanced at him caught his eye quotthat things stay comfortingly the samequot he held her gaze for a moment quoti hadnt really thoughtbut youre rightquot he stopped to let her precede him up the narrow path quotwill you be remaining at bramshaw for longquot she grinned knowing he now behind her couldnt see quotive only just arrivedquot in response to a panicked summons from elizabeth her niece she glanced back at him quoti expect to be here for some weeksquot they reached the back door michael leaned past her to open it conscious as he did of her just her as he followed her into the dim corridor directing her to the drawing room he registered how not simply feminine but female she was how much as a woman she impinged on his senses with her slender yet curvaceous figure gowned in filmy muslin there was nothing the least unusual about the gown it was caro herself who was unusual and that in more ways than one following her into the drawing room he tugged the bell pull when gladys the maid appeared he ordered tea caro had strolled to the long windows at the end of the room she smiled at gladys who bobbed and left then she looked at him quotits such a lovely afternoon shall we sit out on the terrace and enjoy the sunshinequot quotwhy notquot joining her he set the french doors wide he followed her onto the flagged terrace to where a wrought iron table and two chairs stood perfectly placed to capture the sunshine and the vista over the front lawns he held one chair for her then circling the table took the other there was a frown in her eyes when she lifted them to his quoti cant remember have you a butlerquot quotno we did years ago but the house was closed up for some time and he moved onquot he grimaced quoti suppose i should look around for onequot her brows rose quotindeedquot her expression stated that a local member should certainly have a butler quotbut if youre quick you wont need to look farquot he looked his question she smiled quotremember jeb carter he left fritham village to train as a butler under his uncle in london he apparently did well but was seeking to return to the district so he could better watch over his mother muriel was searching for a butler again and she hired him unfortunately carter as so many before him failed to meet muriels exacting standards so she let him go that was only yesterday hes currently staying at his mothers cottagequot quoti seequot he studied her eyes hoping he was reading the messages in the silvery blue accurately quotso you think i should hire himquot she smiled one of her quick approving warming smiles quoti think you should see if he would suit you know him and his family hes honest as the day is long and the carters were always good workersquot he nodded quotill send a messagequot quotnoquot the reproof was gentle but definite quotgo and see him drop by while passingquot he met her eyes then inclined his head there were few he would take direct guidance from but caros edicts in such matters he judged to be beyond question she was indeed the perfect person the unquestionably best qualified person to sound out regarding his direction with elizabeth her niece the tea arrived brought by mrs entwhistle who had clearly come to see caro she took her celebrity in stride he watched as she said all the right things asking after mrs entwhistles son complimenting her on the delicate cream puffs arranged in a dish mrs entwhistle glowed and retreated thoroughly pleased while caro poured michael wondered if she even registered her performance if it was calculated or simply came naturally then she handed him his cup and smiled and he decided that while her responses might once have been learned they were now ingrained essentially spontaneous simply the way she was while they sipped and consumed she nibbled he ate they exchanged news of mutual acquaintances they moved in the same circles were both extremely wellconnected on both diplomatic and political fronts it was supremely easy to fill the time the knack of making polite conversation came readily fluidly to them both a skill attesting to their experience in substance however he would bow to her her comments displayed an insight into people and their reactions that surpassed his own that struck deeper and truer illuminating motives it was pleasant in the sunshine he studied her while they traded information to his eyes she glowed with confidence not the sort that sparkled and gleamed but a quiet steady assurance that shone through that seemed bonedeep infinitely sure almost serene shed grown to be a remarkably calm female one who effortlessly cast an aura of peace it occured to him that time was passing oh so easily he set down his cup quotso what are your plansquot she met his gaze then opened her eyes wide quotto be honest im not surequot there was a hint of selfdeprecatory humor in her tone quoti traveled for some months while in mourning so ive satisfied that urge i did the season this year it was lovely to meet friends again pick up the threads butquot she grimaced lightly quotthats not enough to fill a life i stayed with angela this time im not sure yet what i want to do with the house if i want to open it again and live there hold court like some literary hostess or perhaps immerse myself in good worksquot her lips lifted her eyes teased quotcan you see me doing any of those thingsquot the silver blue of her gaze seemed layered open honest yet with intriguing depths quotnoquot he considered her sitting so relaxed on his terrace he couldnt see her as anything other than shed been an ambassadors lady quoti think you should leave the good works to muriel and a court would be too restricted a stagequot she laughed a golden sound that merged with the gilded afternoon quotyou have a politicians tonguequot she said it approvingly quotbut enough of mewhat of you were you in london this seasonquot it was the opening hed been angling for he let his lips twist wrily quoti was but various committees and bills proved more distracting than anticipatedquot he elaborated content to let her draw him out to form for herself a picture of his life and his need of a wife she was too knowledgable for him to need to spell it out she would seeand be there to explain and assure elizabeth when the time came there was a subtle attraction in speaking with someone who knew his world and understood its nuances watching caros face was a pleasure seeing the expressions flit over her features watching her gestures so elegant and graceful glimpsing the intelligence and humor in her eyes caro too was content yet as he watched her so she too from behind her polished facade watched him and waited eventually he met her gaze simply asked quotwhy were you heading this wayquot the lane led here and only here they both knew it she let her eyes light beamed a brilliant smile his way quotthank you for reminding me what with all this catching up id quite forgotten yet its all very aptquot leaning her forearms on the table she fixed him with her most beguiling look quotas i said im staying with geoffrey but old habits die hard i know quite a few from the ministries and embassies who are spending their summer in the neighborhood ive organized a dinner for tonight butquot she let her smile turn rueful quotim one gentleman short i came to prevail on you to help me balance my table you at least will appreciate how necessary to my peace of mind that isquot he was charmed had to laugh quotnowquot she continued ruthlessly gilding the lily quotwe have a small party from the portuguese embassy and three from the austrian and quot she proceed to outline her guest list no politician worth his salt would refuse the opportunity to bump such elbows he made no pretence of doing so but smiled easily quotill be delighted to obligequot quotthank youquot she gave him her very best smile she might be a trifle out of practice but it still seemed to work a rattle and clop on the graveled drive reached them they both looked then rose as hardacre walked henry once more harnessed to her gig around hardacre saw them and ducked his head quotseems right as rain now you shouldnt have any trouble with himquot caro gathered her reticule and rounded the table michael took her elbow and steadied her down the terrace steps she thanked hardacre then allowed michael to help her up to the gigs seat taking the reins she smiled at him quotat eight oclock then i promise you wont be boredquot quotim sure i wont bequot michael saluted her and stepped back she flicked the reins and henry obliged in perfect style she trotted out along the drive michael watched her go and wondered how shed known hed be here to ask it was the first day in months hed been home yetjust luck or given it was caro was it good management beside him hardacre cleared his throat quotdidnt want to say anything to mrs sutcliffe no point but that horsequot michael looked at him quotwhat about itquot quoti reckon the reason he bolted was because hed been stung with pellets found three tender spots on his left hindquarter like marks left by stones from a slingshotquot he frowned quotboys for a larkquot quotdangerous lark if that be so and i have to say i cant think of any lad hereabouts silly enough to do such a thingquot hardacre was right all the locals lived on horses theyd know the likely outcome of such foolishness quotperhaps there are visitors from london in the vicinity lads who wouldnt knowquot quotaye thats possiblequot hardacre admitted quotanyways cant see any likelihood of it happening again least not to mrs sutcliffequot quotno indeed that would be like lightning striking twicequot hardacre headed back to the stable michael stood for a full minute staring down the drive then he turned and climbed the terrace steps it was too late now to call on geoffrey mollison especially not if his household was at sixes and sevens preparing for caros dinner party doubly so as he himself would be attending and thus would meet geoffrey later yet his impatience had eased he was inclined to view caros dinner as an opportunity rather than a distraction such an event would be the perfect setting in which to refresh his memory and further his acquaintance with elizabeth his ideal bride feeling indebted to caro he strolled inside he needed to unpack his evening gear quotthe enemy is engaged our campaign is underwayquot a triumphant smile wreathing her face caro dropped into a chintzcovered armchair in the family parlor at bramshaw house quotyes but will it workquot perched on the chaise picture pretty in a ruffled gown of sprigged muslin with her long fair hair coiled at her nape elizabeth eyed her hope and trepidation in her big blue eyes quotof course it will workquot caro turned her triumph on the only other occupant of the parlor her secretary edward campbell seated beside elizabeth on the chaise a sober earnest and reliable gentleman of twentythree summers edward did not look at all the sort of gentleman to have swept elizabeth off her feet appearances as caro well knew could be deceptive letting her smile fade she met edwards eyes quoti assure you that when a gentleman like michael anstrutherwetherby makes up his mind you are the ideal candidate for the position of his wife the only way to avoid having to say the word quotnoquot and cling limpetlike to it in the teeth of the considerable pressure that will make no doubt be brought to bear is to convince him before he makes his offer that hes made a mistakequot although her words were for elizabeth she continued to watch edward if the pair were less than rocksolid in their resolve she wanted to see it know it now until five days ago shed been happily ensconced in derbyshire with augusta and had expected to spend the summer months there two urgent summonses from elizabeth one to her one to edward had brought them hotfoot to hampshire via london elizabeth had written panicked at the prospect of finding herself facing an offer from michael anstrutherwetherby caro had thought it a sham she knew michaels age and his circle but elizabeth had related a conversation with her father in which geoffrey having ascertained that elizabeth had formed no tendre for any gentleman shed met while in town during the season had proceeded to sing michaels praises that caro had had to admit sounded suspicious not because michael wasnt perfectly praiseworthy but because geoffrey had sought to point that out edward too had had doubts over elizabeths conjecture but stopping in london on their way down hed dropped in on certain friends like him aides and secretaries to the politically powerful what hed learned had brought him home pale and tense the whispers had it that michael anstrutherwetherby had been put on notice for a cabinet position part of that notice concerned his marital status and the suggestion he alter it by autumn caro had delayed another day in town long enough to pay a morning call on michaels formidable aunt harriet jennet theyd spoken political hostess to diplomatic hostess caro hadnt even had to broach the subject harriet had seized the opportunity to drop a word in her ear regarding michaels interest in elizabeth that had been more than confirmation enough matters were indeed as serious as elizabeth had supposed caro shifted her gaze to her niece she herself had been a diplomatic bride a young and innocent seventeenyearold swept off her feet by the supremely polished attentions of an older in her case much older man she admittedly had had no other love in her life but not for the world would she wish such a marriage on any other young girl although shed never known love herself she had every sympathy for elizabeth and edward it was in her household in lisbon theyd first met shed never encouraged them but to her mind that also meant not opposing them if love was to be it would be and in their case it had indeed grown theyd remained steadfast for over three years and neither showed any sign of wavering in their affection shed already been thinking of what she might do to further edwards career at least to the point he could offer for elizabeths hand that however was not a matter for today michaels prospective offer had to be dealt with first now immediately quotyou have to understandquot she explained quotthat once michael makes an offer it will be much harder to get him to withdraw it and harder still for you placed as you are your fathers daughter to refuse it our wisest course therefore is to ensure the offer is never made and that means changing michaels mindquot his brown eyes serious edward looked at elizabeth quoti agree its by far the best way the tack most likely to succeed with least damage to allquot elizabeth met his gaze then glanced at caro then sighed quotvery well i concede youre right so what must i doquot caro smiled encouragingly quotfor tonight we must concentrate on raising the question of your suitability in his mind we dont need to repulse him all at once but simply make him pause and consider however whatever we do can be neither overt nor obviousquot imagining the possibilities she narrowed her eyes quotthe key to manipulating the opinions of a gentleman like michael anstrutherwetherby is always to be subtle and circumspect
