 mac mccullum scanned the petra perimeter with highpowered field glasses rayford should have reached him by now macs watch showed 1300 hoursone in the afternoon carpathia time it had to be more than a hundred degrees fahrenheit sweat ran down his neck from the grayish red hair peeking out from under his cap soaking his shirt mac detected not even a wisp of wind and wondered what his freckled leathery face would look like in a few days without taking his eyes from the lenses mac unholstered his phone and punched in the connection to chang wong in the computer center wheres ray i was about to ask you chang said he left here fortyfive minutes ago and no one else has seen him either what do we hear from buck mac noticed the hesitation nothing new since when uh rayford heard from him late this morning and another beat nothing to speak of whatre you sayin chang nothing i gathered whats wrong nothing that wont be cured in a little i dont need doubletalk buddy mac continued surveying the rocky slopes feeling his pulse quicken despite his years and experience if you wont tell me ill call him myself buck well who else ive tried my sensor shows his phone inoperable turned off unlikely mr mccullum well i should guess so malfunctioning damaged im hoping the former sir global positioning system active at least no sir chaim rosenzweig had not slept and after only two light meals of manna he expected to feel the fatigue but no the best he could calculate this was the day he felt the swelling anticipation in both his head and his chest it was as if his mind raced as his heart ached for the greatest event in the history of the cosmos the old mans senior advisers a halfdozen elders sat with him deep in the stone compound of petra eleazar tiberias a broad globe of a man offered that the millionplus pilgrims under their charge are clearly as restless as we is there nothing we can tell them i have an activity in mind chaim said but what would you have me say i am newer to this than you rabbi but please chaim said raising a hand reserve such a title for dr benjudah i am merely a student thrust into this nonetheless eleazar continued i sense the populace is as eager as i to know the exact moment of messiahs return i mean if it is as you and dr benjudah have for so long taught seven years from the signing of the covenant between antichrist and israel does that mean it will be to the minute i recall the signing being at around four in the afternoon israel time seven years ago today chaim smiled i have no idea i do know this god has his own economy of time do i believe messiah will return today yes will it trouble me if he does not appear until tomorrow no my faith will not be shaken but i expect him soon and this activity you mentioned yes something to occupy the minds of the people while we wait i came across a videodisc of a dramatic sermon from before the turn of the century by an africanamerican preacher long since in heaven of course i propose calling the people together and showing it the lord may come while it is playing an elder said so much the better there remain unbelievers among us eleazar said chaim shook his head i confess that puzzles and disturbs me but it also fulfills prophecy there are those who enjoy the safety of petra even many who believe jesus was the most influential person who ever lived who have not yet put their faith in him they do not recognize him as the longawaited messiah and they have not acknowledged him as their savior this sermon is also evangelistic perhaps many of the undecided will take their stand before messiah appears better than waiting until the event itself someone said gather the people for a twooclock showing chaim said rising and lets close in prayer begging your pardon eleazar said but do you feel the absence of dr benjudah as keenly as i do more than you know eleazar lets pray for him right now and i will call him in a few minutes i would love to share his greeting with the people and hear what has been happening in jerusalem macs magnified vision fell upon colorful metallic pieces glinting in the sun perhaps a mile from his position oh no a red fuel tank and a tire looked very much like parts from rayfords allterrain vehicle mac tried to steady his hands as he panned in a wide arc looking for signs of his friend it appeared the atv could have been hit by a heatseeking missile or smashed to bits by tumbling perhaps he thought no sign of rayford nearby was good news mac raised chang again sorry to be a nuisance he said but what does your sensor say about rays phone i was afraid youd ask its inoperable too but its gps is still pulsing my screen shows it deep in a narrow crevasse a little over fortyfive hundred feet below you im heading down there wait mr mccullum what ive got a lens pointed that way and theres no room in the opening for a person you can see the phone no but i know its there it can be the only thing there the opening is too narrow for anything else so have you seen his atv too im looking well i have if that phone is due south of me look about twenty degrees east hang on i see it but no sign of ray chang im going to look sir could you send someone else why im twiddling my thumbs here big dog one has the troops under control frankly id rather you go to jerusalem you gonna tell me whats goin on come see me mr mccullum i was honoring the confidence of captain steele but i think youand dr rosenzweigshould know mac arrived at the tech center deep in the bowels of petra a few minutes after onethirty in the afternoon chaim rose to meet him while chang acknowledged him with a look but kept turning back to his numerous screens finally chang pulled away and the three sat far from the ears of others mac noticed however that many techies and others frequently stole glances in their direction theres no delicate way to say this chang began captain steele told naomi and me this morning that mr williams had told him that dr benjudah was killed in the fighting at jerusalem mac stiffened chaim buried his face in his hands i hope he did not suffer terribly the old man said with captain steele missing now and what him too chaim said and i am unable to raise cameron on the phone i felt you both should know i mean i know this may all be moot by this time tomorrow perhaps even by four this afternoon chaim said the question now is what to say what to do nothin we can do mac said ive got abdullah smith looking for ray chang here thinks i ought to go to jerusalem chaim looked up in apparent surprise i do chang said from the looks of whats left of his vehicle and his phone odds are all mr smith is going to find are captain steeles remains im sorry to be so blunt but a flight to jerusalem now chaim said just to see whether cameron its what i would want if it was me mac said i know he may be dead and either way jesus is comin but with tsion gone id just as soon get buck outa there and back here with us even for as little as an hour chaim said more a statement than a question like i say thats what id want and what do we tell the people chaim said minutes later mac was in gus zuckermandels quarters he filled in the young man on his plans and heres the hard part zeke i want to leave in ten minutes can you give me twenty fifteen deal whatve you got z mac said as the forger yanked open a file drawer riffled through several folders and slapped one open on his desk your new identity zeke said moving to a closet which he opened with a flourish there were two dozen blackonblack global community unity army uniforms from tinted eyeshield helmets to calflength boots find one that fits while im working on your documents dont forget the gloves nobodys checking for marks of loyalty anymore anyway but just to be safe how do you do this z mac said approaching garments that looked his size with lots of help sebastians boys have killed a few of em and i got me a little crew that runs out and gathers up their stuffpapers clothes and all weapons course when mac emerged with the uniform a perfect fit he found zeke mixing some sort of a brew you look good mac he said problem is you got to be black and you can manage that in a few minutes if youre game whatever it takes mac whipped off his helmet jacket shirt and gloves zeke used the mix to paint him dark brown from the shoulders to the hairline keep the helmet on cause i havent got time to make the hair authentic check and lets do your hands just in case zeke dyed macs skin from midforearm to fingertips this should dry in two and a half minutes then an instant photo and youre on your way give my best to buck and tsion mac hesitated you betcha zeke youre a genius the younger man snorted just here to serve mac was sprinting to a chopper when he reached abdullah smith by phone nothing yet mac i will let you know as soon as i discover anything as mac lifted off he saw multitudes streaming from all corners of petra and gathering at the central meeting place chaim was alarmed at the mood of the throng it was the biggest crowd he had ever drawn at petra and it was noisy clearly preoccupied antsy he heard nervous laughter saw lots of embracing when one or two would look to the skies hundredssometimes thousandswould do likewise my beloved brothers and sisters in messiah he began as well as the seekers and undecided among us please try to quiet yourselves and settle for a moment please i know we all expect the imminent return of our lord and savior and i can think of no greater privilege than to have him appear as we speak but he was interrupted by thunderous applause and cheering chaim gestured that they should be seated i share your enthusiasm and while i know that there will be nothing else on your minds until he comes i thought there might be value in focusing specifically on him this afternoon i know there remain among us many who are withholding their decisions about him until he appears consider this my last effort to persuade you not to wait we do not know what may befall us at that moment whether god will allow scoffers and mockers and rejecters to change their minds pray he will not harden your heart due to your rebellion or unbelief surely there has been more than enough evidence than anyone could need to reveal the truth of gods plan while we watch and wait consider the thoughts of a great preacher from decades past his name was dr shadrach meshach lockridge and his message is entitled my king is chaim signaled for the disc to play and it was projected off two white walls of smooth stone each several stories high where all could see it the sound system carried it to the ends of the seated masses lockridge proved to be animated and thunderous interrupting his own cadence of shouts and growls with whispers and huge smiles the disc caught him near the end of his sermon and he was picking up steam the bible says my king is a sevenway king hes the king of the jews thats a racial king hes the king of israel thats a national king hes the king of righteousness hes the king of the ages hes the king of heaven hes the king of glory hes the king of kings besides being a sevenway king hes the lord of lords thats my king well i wonder do you know him hundreds of thousands applauded and many stood only to sit again as lockridge continued david said the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament showeth his handiwork my king is a sovereign king no means of measure can define his limitless love no farseeing telescope can bring into visibility the coastline of his shoreless supply no barrier can hinder him from pouring out his blessings hes enduringly strong hes entirely sincere hes eternally steadfast hes immortally graceful hes infinitely powerful hes impartially merciful do you know him many shouted their agreement hes the greatest phenomenon that has ever crossed the horizon of this world hes gods son hes the sinners savior hes the centerpiece of civilization he stands in the solitude of himself hes honest and hes unique hes unparalleled hes unprecedented he is the loftiest idea in literature hes the highest personality in philosophy he is the supreme problem in higher criticism hes the fundamental doctrine of true theology hes the core the necessity for spiritual religion hes the miracle of the ages yes he is hes the superlative of everything good that you choose to call him hes the only one qualified to be our allsufficiency i wonder if you know him today as the preacher continued more and more listeners stood some raising their hands others shouting agreement others nodding he supplies strength for the weak hes available for the tempted and tried he sympathizes and he saves he strengthens and sustains he guards and he guides he heals the sick he cleanses the leper he forgives the sinner he discharges debtors he delivers the captive he defends the feeble he blesses the young he serves the unfortunate he regards the aged he rewards the diligent and he beautifies the meek i wonder if you know him well this is my king hes the key to knowledge hes the wellspring of wisdom hes the doorway of deliverance hes the pathway of peace hes the roadway of righteousness hes the highway of holiness hes the gateway of glory do you know him well his office is manifold his promise is sure his life is matchless his goodness is limitless his mercy is everlasting his love never changes his word is enough his grace is sufficient his reign is righteous his yoke is easy and his burden is light i wish i could describe him to you that elicited an ocean of laughter and more applause the same had happened with his original audience and lockridge had paused allowing it to fade before he continued hes indescribable hes incomprehensible hes invincible hes irresistible well you cant get him out of your mind you cant get him off of your hand you cant outlive him and you cant live without him the pharisees couldnt stand him but they found they couldnt stop him pilate couldnt find any fault in him herod couldnt kill him death couldnt handle him and the grave couldnt hold him thats my king everyone was standing now hands raised many applauding shouting some dancing and thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever and ever and ever how long is that and ever and ever and when you get through with all the forevers then amen good god almighty amen by the time mac found himself within sight of the rocky judean hills where jerusalem lay smoking in the early afternoon sun he had begun to despair of finding buck if he was all right would he not have borrowed a phone to check in the latest intelligence from chang was that buck had reported tsions death to rayford from inside the old city though the colossal armies of the worldnow amalgamated into carpathias global community unity armystretched by the multimillions from north of jerusalem to edom it was clear from the air that the current major offensive focused on the old city mac looked for a place to land he had to look like a gc officer on assignment and head on foot to the old city as if he knew what he was doing in fact he didnt have a clue the old city was only a third of a mile square and if he found buck alive what was he to do arrest him and muscle him to the chopper finding buck dead or alive mac decided would be like discovering a patch of dry ground in the louisiana bayou macs phone chirped and he saw it was chang give me some good news such as such as bucks dead phone all of a sudden started showin his position no such luck but i do have something carpathias on the rampage about the destruction of new babylon and hes taking heat from all over the world heat everybody who depended on new babylon is crying over the loss im picking up televised reports from everywhere of leaders diplomats businessmenyou name itliterally weeping decrying whats become of new babylon and their own interests some are committing suicide right on camera no way the gc is puttin that stuff on the air no they arent but yours truly still has his ways attaboy chang but how does that help me find buck youre not going to find buck mr mccullum what you know that for sure im just stating the obvious ye of little faith sorry but i figured as long as youre there and undercover you might want to know where carpathia is i dont care where he is im here to find buck all right then but just for smiles where is he last i heard he was on a bullhorn outside herods gate moved there from his bunker near the sea of galilee unless they were just broadcasting his voice no it was him all right hes moved his entire command post inside the old city impossible im lookin down on it right now and the place is crawling with i thought so too until i heard where underground you dont mean solomons stables how do i get in there follow somebody carpathias got an entire regiment there and i got your new name on the list that might not have been prudent chang why what if i choose not to go am discovered missing and someone sees me elsewhere well there is that possibility yes tell em youre on your way what if im not i mean id love to be your eyes and ears here chang but my priority is buck and nothin we know about carpathia now is going to amount to a hill of beans anyway whats gonna happen is gonna happen can you get me off that list not without looking suspicious sorry mr mccullum i thought i was doing the right dont worry about it none of it will matter tomorrow will it mac saw gc activity and other choppers putting down at the tombs of the prophets south of the mount of olives east of the old city caravans of jeeps quickly loaded the disgorged personnel and raced them toward the conflict as soon as mac stepped out of his copter at 245 pm an officer directing traffic pointed him to an armored personnel carrier mac saluted and jogged that way he joined a dozen other likeuniformed soldiers who merely nodded at each other tightlipped and rode in stony silence the cavalcade headed north on jericho road and turned west in front of the rockefeller museum onto suleiman street we headed to herods gate someone said is it open someone else said damascus gate the driver announced as they passed herods gate mac joined the others in pressing against the windows on the south side of the vehicle somehow the resistance continued to hold the gate if youre assigned to the potentate the driver said follow me to the entrance to the stables everybody else head for the staging area at the church of the flagellation when we have enough personnel well attack the insurgents from behind and blow em out herods gate mac felt himself swelling with pride over what tsion and buck had apparently accomplished before the rabbi was killed if they had been at herods gate they were responsible for helping hold that position against overwhelming odds and neither of them battle trained mac assumed buck would agree that tsion would not want his body removed from the old city he only hoped buck had found an appropriate spot for the rabbi bodies fallen in an active battle had a way of getting trampled beyond recognition that wouldnt matter tomorrow either but mac knew he and buck would be on the same page mac found himself fighting anguish no way buck would let them worry and wonder for this long surely he could have found a way to check in if he was alive when the vehicle stopped and the driver gave the order mac and the soldiers got out and moved as directed mac dropped several paces behind his group and phoned chang speaking quietly anything nothing im not going to succeed am i what do you want to hear sir you know im past pretending mr mccullum i appreciate that maybe i should just proceed to my assignment to the compound yeah i know i should have my head examined but id love to be with ol nick when jesus gets here chang felt naomis strong fingers on either side of his neck youre tense she said arent you he said relax love messiah is coming chang couldnt turn from the screens id like to lose no one else before that no matter how much i tell myself theyll be dead only a short while it all seems so pointless now i dont want anyone hurt let alone suffering then dying mr mccullums going was my idea but he sure jumped on it didnt he i knew he would i wish i could have gone you know this place cant function without your dont start naomi you know its true regardless i sent him for my own vicarious thrill no way hes going to find buck and if he does buck will be dead then whats mac supposed to do if he gets found out hes history and for what he could be here watching for the return with everyone else naomi pulled a chair next to chang and sat what do you hear from mr smith chang sighed thats turned out to be a waste of time and manpower too so far he hasnt found a thing either captain steele was obliterated by a missile or he was buried in the sand could he have crawled to safety theres no safety in that sun naomi thats what i mean maybe he found shelter or built himself some shield against the heat chang shrugged bestcase scenario i guess but wouldnt he think to leave some sign for us maybe he was hurt too badly or simply had no resources he could arrange sticks or rocks even a piece of clothing if he was able naomi said changs phone made them both jump yes mr smith im on his trail he was on the move for a while at least what did you find blood im afraid
