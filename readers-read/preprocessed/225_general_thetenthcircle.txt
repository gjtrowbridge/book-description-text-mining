 prologue december 23 2005 this is how it feels when you realize your child is missing the pit of your stomach freezes fast while your legs go to jelly theres one single bluebass thud of your heart the shape of her name sharp as metal filings gets caught between your teeth even as you try to force it out in a shout fear breathes like a monster into your ear where did i see her last would she have wandered away who could have taken her and then finally your throat seals shut as you swallow the fact that youve made a mistake you will never be able to fix the first time it happened to daniel stone a decade ago he had been visiting boston his wife was at a colloquium at harvard that was a good enough reason to take a family vacation while laura sat on her panel daniel pushed trixies stroller the cobbled length of the freedom trail they fed the ducks in the public garden they watched the sloeeyed sea turtles doing water ballet at the aquarium after that when trixie announced that she was hungry daniel headed toward faneuil hall and its endless food court that particular april day was the first one warm enough for new englanders to unzip their jackets to remember that there was any season other than winter in addition to the centipedes of school groups and the shutterhappy tourists it seemed that the whole of the financial district had bled out men daniels age in suits and ties who smelled of aftershave and envy they sat with their gyros and chowder and corned beef on rye on the benches near the statue of red auerbach they sneaked sideways glances at daniel he was used to this it was unusual for a father to be the primary caretaker of his fouryearold daughter women who saw him with trixie assumed that his wife had died or that he was newly divorced men who saw him quickly looked the other way embarrassed on his behalf and yet daniel would not have traded his setup for the world he enjoyed molding his job around trixies schedule he liked her questions did dogs know they were naked is adult supervision a power grownups use to fight bad guys he loved the fact that when trixie was spacing out in her car seat and wanted attention she always started with dad even if laura happened to be driving the car what do you want for lunch daniel asked trixie that day in boston pizza soup a burger she stared up at him from her stroller a miniature of her mother with the same blue eyes and strawberry hair and nodded yes to all three daniel had hefted the stroller up the steps to the central food court the scent of the salted ocean air giving way to grease and onions and stirfry he would get trixie a burger and fries he decided and for himself hed buy a fishermans platter at another kiosk he stood in line at the grill the stroller jutting out like a stone that altered the flow of human traffic a cheeseburger daniel yelled out to a cook he hoped was listening when he was handed the paper plate he juggled his wallet free so that he could pay and then decided that it wasnt worth a second tour of duty just to get himself lunch too he and trixie could share daniel maneuvered the stroller into the stream of people again waiting to be spit out into the cupola after a few minutes an elderly man sitting at a long table shuffled his trash together and left daniel set down the burger and turned the stroller so that he could feed trixie but the child inside was a darkhaired darkskinned infant who burst into tears when he saw the stranger in front of him daniels first thought why was this baby in trixies stroller his second was this trixies stroller yes it was yellow and blue with a tiny repeating bear print yes there was a carrying basket underneath but graco must have sold millions of these thousands alone in the northeast now at closer inspection daniel realized that this particular stroller had a plastic activity bar attached on the front trixies ratty security blanket was not folded up in the bottom just in case of crisis such as now daniel looked down at the baby again the baby that was not his and immediately grabbed the stroller and starting running to the grill standing there with a cabbagecheeked boston cop was a hysterical mother whose sights homed in on the stroller daniel was using to part the crowd like the red sea she ran the last ten feet and yanked her baby out of the safety restraint and into her arms while daniel tried to explain but all that came out of his mouth was where is she he thought hysterical of the fact that this was an openair market that there was no way to seal the entrance or even make a general public announcement that by now five minutes had passed and his daughter could be with the psychopath who stole her on the t heading to the farthest outskirts of the boston suburbs then he noticed the stroller his stroller kicked over onto its side the safety belt undone trixie had gotten proficient at this just last week it had gotten comical they would be out walking and suddenly she was standing up in the fabric hammock facing daniel grinning at her own clever expertise had she freed herself to come looking for him or had someone seeing a golden opportunity for abduction done it for her in the moments afterward there were tracts of time that daniel couldnt remember even to this day for example how long it took the swarm of police that converged on faneuil hall to do a search or the way other mothers pulled their own children close to their side as he passed certain bad luck was contagious the detectives hammered questions a quiz of good parenting how tall is trixie what does she weigh what was she wearing have you ever talked to her about strangers this last one daniel couldnt answer had he or had he just been planning to would trixie know to scream to run away would she be loud enough fast enough the police wanted him to sit down so that theyd know where to find him if necessary daniel nodded and promised and then was on his feet the moment their backs were turned he searched behind each of the food kiosks in the central court he looked under the tables in the cupola he burst into the womens bathroom crying trixies name he checked beneath the ruffled skirts of the pushcarts that sold rhinestone earrings moose socks your name written on a grain of rice then he ran outside the courtyard was full of people who didnt know that just twenty feet away from them the world had been overturned oblivious they shopped and milled and laughed as daniel stumbled past them the corporate lunch hour had ended and many of the businessmen were gone pigeons pecked at the crumbs theyd left behind caught between the cobblestones and huddled beside the seated bronze of red auerbach sucking her thumb was trixie until daniel saw her he didnt truly realize how much of himself had been carved away by her absence he felt ironically the same symptoms that had come the moment he knew she was missing the shaking legs the loss of speech the utter immobility trixie he said finally then she was in his arms thirty pounds of sweet relief now ten years later daniel had again mistaken his daughter for someone she wasnt except this time she was no longer a fouryearold in a stroller this time she had been gone much longer than twentyfour minutes and she had left him instead of the other way around forcing his mind back to the present daniel cut the throttle of the snow machine as he came to a fork in the path immediately the storm whipped into a funnel he couldnt see two feet in front of himself and when he took the time to look behind his tracks had already been filled a seamless stretch the yupik eskimos had a word for this kind of snow the kind that bit at the back of your eyes and landed like a hail of arrows on your bare skin pirrelvag the term rose in daniels throat as startling as a second moon proof that he had been here before no matter how good a job hed done of convincing himself otherwise he squinted it was nine oclock in the morning but in december in alaska there wasnt much sunlight his breath hung before him like lace for a moment through the curtain of snow he thought he could see the bright flash of her hair a foxs tail peeking from a snug woolen cap but as quickly as he saw it it was gone the yupiit also had a word for the moments when it was so cold that a mug of water thrown into the air would harden like glass before it ever hit the frozen ground cikuqerluni one wrong move daniel thought and everything will go to pieces around me so he closed his eyes gunned the machine and let instinct take over almost immediately the voices of elders he used to know came back to him spruce needles stick out sharper on the north side of trees shallow sandbars make the ice buckle hints about how to find yourself when the world changed around you he suddenly thought back to the way at faneuil hall trixie had melted against him when they were reunited her chin had notched just behind his shoulder her body went boneless with faith in spite of what hed done shed still trusted him to keep her safe to bring her home in hindsight daniel could see that the real mistake hed made that day hadnt been turning his back momentarily it had been believing that you could lose someone you loved in an instant when in reality it was a process that took months years her lifetime it was the kind of cold that made your eyelashes freeze the minute you walked outside and the insides of your nostrils feel like shattered glass it was the kind of cold that went through you as if you were no more than a mesh screen trixie stone shivered on the frozen riverbank beneath the school building that was checkpoint headquarters in tuluksak sixty miles from the spot where her fathers borrowed snow machine was carving a signature across the tundra and tried to think up reasons to stay right where she was unfortunately there were more reasons better reasons to leave first and foremost it was a mistake to stay in one place too long second sooner or later people were going to figure out that she wasnt who they thought she was especially if she kept screwing up every task they gave her but then again how was she supposed to know that all the mushers were entitled to complimentary straw for their sled dogs at several points during the k300 racecourse including here in tuluksak or that you could take a musher to the spot where food and water was stored but you werent allowed to help feed the dogs after those two fiascos trixie was demoted to babysitting the dogs that were dropped from a team until the bush pilots arrived to transport them back to bethel so far the only dropped dog was a husky named juno frostbite that was the official reason given by the musher the dog had one brown eye and one blue eye and he stared at trixie with an expression that spoke of being misunderstood in the past hour trixie had managed to sneak juno an extra handful of kibble and a couple of biscuits stolen from the vets supply she wondered if she could buy juno from the musher with some of the money left over in the stolen wallet she thought maybe it would be easier to keep running if she had someone else to confide in someone who couldnt possibly tell on her she wondered what zephyr and moss and anyone else back home in the other bethel bethel maine would say if they saw her sitting in a snowbank and eating salmon jerky and listening for the crazy fugue of barking that preceded the arrival of a dog team probably they would think she had lost her mind theyd say who are you and what have you done with trixie stone the thing is she wanted to ask the same question she wanted to crawl into her favorite flannel pajamas the ones that had been washed so often they were as soft as the skin of a rose she wanted to open up the refrigerator and not be able to find anything on its stocked shelves worth eating she wanted to get sick of a song on the radio and smell her fathers shampoo and trip over the curly edge of the rug in the hallway she wanted to go back not just to maine but to early september trixie could feel tears rising in her throat like the watermarks on the portland dock and she was afraid someone would notice so she lay down on the matted straw her nose nearly touching junos you know she whispered i got left behind once too her father didnt think she remembered what had happened that day in faneuil hall but she did bits and pieces cropped up at the strangest times like when they went to the beach in the summer and she smelled the ocean it suddenly got harder to breathe or how at hockey games and movie theaters and other places where she got mixed up in a crowd she sometimes felt sick to her stomach trixie remembered too that they had abandoned the stroller at faneuil hall her father simply carried her back in his arms even after they returned from vacation and bought a new stroller trixie had refused to ride in it heres what she didnt remember about that day the gettinglost part trixie could not recall unbuckling the safety harness or pushing through the shifting sea of legs to the doors that led outside then she saw the man who looked like he might be her father but who actually turned out to be a statue sitting down trixie had walked to the bench and climbed up beside him only to realize that his metal skin was warm because the sun had been beating down on it all day shed curled up against the statue wishing with every shaky breath that she would be found this time around thats what scared her most
