 he waited shivering the boy huddled close to the dying embers of his meager fire his pale blue eyes sunken and dark from lack of sleep his mouth moved slowly as he repeated the chant he had learned from his father his dry lips cracking painfully and his throat sore from intoning the holy words his nearly black hair was matted with dust from sleeping in the dirt despite his resolve to remain alert while awaiting his vision exhaustion had overcome him on three occasions his normally slender frame and high cheekbones were accentuated by his rapid weight loss rendering him gaunt and pale he wore only a vision seekers loincloth after the first night he had sorely missed his leather tunic and trousers his sturdy boots and his dark green cloak above the night sky surrendered to a predawn grey and the stars began to fade from view the very air seemed to pause as if waiting for a first intake of breath the first stirring of a new day the stillness was uncommon both unnerving and fascinating and the boy held his breath for a moment in concert with the world around him then a tiny gust the softest breath of night sighing touched him and he let his own breathing resume as the sky to the east lightened he reached over and picked up a gourd he sipped at the water within savoring it as much as possible for it was all he was permitted until he experienced his vision and reached the creek which intersected with the trail a mile below as he made his way home for two days he had sat below the peak of shatana higo in the place of manhood waiting for his vision prior to that he had fasted drinking only herb teas and water then he had eaten the traditional meal of the warrior dried meat hard bread and water with bitter herbs before spending half a day climbing the dusty path up the eastern face of the holy mountain to the tiny depression a dozen yards below the summit the clearing would scarcely accommodate half a dozen men but it seemed vast and empty to the boy as he entered the third day of the ceremony a childhood spent in a large house with many relatives had ill prepared him for such isolation for this was the first time in his existence he had been without companionship for more than a few hours as was customary among the orosini the boy had started the manhood ritual on the third day before the midsummer celebration which the lowlanders call banapis the boy would greet the new year the end of his life as a child in contemplating the lore of his family and clan his tribe and nation and seeking the wisdom of his ancestors it was a time of deep introspection and meditation as the boy sought to understand his place in the order of the universe the role laid before him by the gods and on this day he was expected to gain his manhood name if events went as they should he would rejoin his family and clan in time for the evening midsummer festival as a child he had been called kieli a diminution of kielianapuna the red squirrel the clever and nimble dweller in the forests of home never seen but always present they were considered lucky when glimpsed by the orosini and kieli was considered to be a lucky child the boy shivered almost uncontrollably for his paltry stores of body fat hardly insulated him from the nights chill even in the middle of the summer the peaks of the mountains of the orosini were cold after the sun fled kieli waited for the vision he saw the sky lighten a slow progressive shift from grey to pale greyblue then to a rose hue as the sun approached he saw the brilliance of the sun crest the distant mountain a whitish golden orb that brought him another day of loneliness he averted his eyes when the disk of the sun cleared the mountains lest his vision flee from him the trembling in his body lessened as the sun finally rose sufficiently to begin to relieve the chill he waited at first expectantly then with a deep fatiguegenerated hopelessness each orosini boy endured this ritual upon the midsummer day close to the time of his birth anniversary in one of the many such holy places scattered throughout the region for years beyond numbering boys had climbed to these vantage points and men had returned he experienced a brief moment of envy as he recalled that the girls of his age in the village would be in the round house with the women at the moment chatting and eating singing and praying somehow the girls found their womens names without the privation and hardship endured by the boys kieli let the moment pass dwelling on what you cant control was futile as his grandfather would say he thought of his grandfather laughter in his eyes who had been the last to speak to him as he climbed the lonely trail from the valley where his people dwelt the old man had smiled as he always had he could hardly remember a time when he hadnt seen a smile on the old mans face grandfathers face was like brown leather from nearly eighty years of living in the mountains his clan tattoos upon his left cheek still black despite years in the sun the old mans keen eyes and strong features were always framed by steelgrey hair down to his shoulders kieli resembled his grandfather more than his father for they both shared the olive skin which turned nutbrown in the summer and never burned and in his youth grandfather had also had hair the color of a ravens wing others remarked that an outlander must have joined their family generations ago for the orosini were a fair race and even brown hair was unusual kielis grandfather had whispered when the gourd is empty on midsummers day remember this if the gods havent already provided you with a name that means youre allowed to choose one you like and then the old chieftain had smothered him in a playful but still strong hug that sent him stumbling along the path the other men in the village of kulaam looked on smiling or laughing for the festival would soon be upon them and the time of the naming vision was a joyous time kieli remembered his grandfathers words and wondered if any boy actually had his name bestowed upon him by the gods examining the gourd he judged he would be out of water by midday he knew he would find water at a brook halfway down the path to the village but he also knew that meant he had to leave the ledge when the sun was at its zenith he sat silently for a while thoughts of his village dancing through his mind like the splashing foam of the brook behind the long hall perhaps if he set his mind free he thought if he didnt try too hard to find his vision it would come to him he wanted to return soon for he missed his family his father elks call at dawn was everything the boy hoped to be strong friendly kind resolute fearless in battle and gentle with his children he missed his mother whisper of the night wind and his younger sister miliana and most of all he missed his older brother hand of the sun who had returned from his own vision but two years earlier his skin burned red by the sun except for a pale print of his own hand where it had rested all day upon his chest their grandfather had joked that hand was not the first boy to have come to his vision while asleep hand had always been kind to his younger brother and sister taking care to watch over them when their mother was out gleaning the field or showing them the best places to find ripening berries memories of those berries crushed with honey and served on hot bread made kielis mouth water the celebration would be joyous and the thought of the food that waited below gave kieli cramps of hunger he would be permitted to sit in the long house with the men rather than in the round house with his mother and the other women and children he felt a pang of loss at that thought for the singing of the women as they oversaw the domestic chores of the day their laughter and chatter the gossip and the jokes had been a part of his daily life for as long as he could remember but he also looked forward with pride to being allowed to sit with the men of the clan his body shivered uncontrollably for a moment then he sighed and relaxed as the sun warmed him further he let his stiff muscles loosen then moved to his knees and attended to the fire he placed a few fresh twigs upon the glowing coals then blew upon them and in a few minutes it was done he would let the flames die down after the mountain air warmed up but for now he was thankful for the nearby heat he sat back against the rocks which were warming with the sunlight despite the lingering chill in the air and took another drink letting out a long sigh he glanced at the sky why no vision he wondered why had he received no message from the gods granting him his mans name his name would be the key to his nahatah the secret nature of his being that thing which only he and the gods would know other people would know his name for he would proclaim it with pride but no one would know the nature of his vision and what his name said to him about his place in the universe his mission from the gods or his destiny his grandfather had once told him that few men truly understood their nahatah even if they thought they did the vision was only the first hint from the gods as to their plans for a man sometimes his grandfather had said the plan was a simple one to be a good husband and father a provider for the wellbeing of the village and the nation an example for others to emulate for it might be that his role was to be a father to someone chosen a special one a narif and that plan would unfold long after a mans death kieli knew what his grandfather would say at this moment that he worried too much and that he should simply put aside worry and let the gods bring to him their will kieli knew his father would say the same adding that to hunt or give counsel in the long house or to be a good husband first one must learn to be patient and to listen he closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of the breeze in the mountains it spoke to him as leaves rustled in the cedars and pines at times the wind could be a cruel companion cutting through the heaviest of furs with a bitter freezing edge at other times it was blessed relief cooling the hottest days of summer his father had taught him of its voices and taught him that to learn the language of the wind was to be one with it as were the hawks and eagles who built their nests among the craggy peaks a screech split the morning air and kielis head turned with a snap as a silver hawk struck at a rabbit less than a dozen yards from where he rested the silver hawk was the rarest of the hawks of the high mountains its feathers were actually grey with a mottling of near black around the head and shoulders but an oily sheen upon the wings caused the bird to glisten with silver highlights when it sped through the clear sky with a single beat of its wings the hawk gripped the struggling rabbit tightly and launched itself into the air like a kitten carried by its mother the rabbit hung limply from the birds talons as if resigned to its fate kieli knew the animal had gone into shock natures kindness as pain and thought were dulled he had once seen a stag lying motionless on the ground awaiting the hunters final mercy with a knife felled by an arrow that hadnt killed it in the distance he saw other birds wheeling lazily in the morning air catching thermals off the rapidly heating rocks so that they could glide in search of a meal turkey buzzards he knew their large wingspan allowed them to drift on the rising hot air while they scanned below for the dead and dying ungainly and ugly on the ground as they hopped to the carcass of a fallen animal on the wing they were majestic to the south he saw a blacktailed kite balanced in midair tail pointed downward while its wings beat quickly for two or three strokes then halted to allow it to fall slightly then beat again to hold the kite in place above its intended kill then with stunning swiftness it stooped talons extended downward and with precision bordering on the supernatural struck the ground in a tight arc lifting off without even a moments hesitation a squealing vole clutched in its claws from the distance forest sounds reached him the rhythms of the day and night were different and now the diurnal residents of the forests below were making their presence felt as their nocturnal neighbors sought out shelters in which to sleep a woodpecker industriously sought out insects in the bark of a nearby tree from the pattern of the sound kieli knew it was the large redtopped who was digging out his meal his tapping was slow thunderous and persistent unlike the more dainty staccato of his smaller bluewinged cousin the sun rose higher in the morning sky and soon the fire died unneeded as the heat of day returned to the rocks kieli resisted the temptation to finish drinking the last of his water for he knew that he must harbor it until he was ready to descend the trail he could drink his fill at the creek below but he had to get there first and should he waste his water now there was no guarantee he would safely reach the creek it was rare that a boy perished upon the peaks but it had happened the tribe prepared each boy as fully as possible but those who had failed to survive the naming ordeal were considered to have been judged by the gods as lacking and their families mourning was a bitter counterpoint to the celebration of midsummer the heat increased and the air dried and suddenly kieli realized a satata was upon them the wind from the north blew cold yearround but the summer western wind would grow hotter and dryer by the minute the boy had seen grass turn brown and brittle in less than three days and fruit dry upon the branch from this wind men grew restless and women irritable when the satata lingered more than a few days and the skin itched kieli and his brother had swum in lakes and rivers on such days only to be dry by the time they had returned to the village as if they had not felt the cooling touch of water at all kieli also knew he was now in danger for the satata would suck the moisture from his body if he remained he glanced at the sky and realized he had only two more hours before midday he glanced at the sun now more than halfway along its climb to the midheaven and he blinked as tears gathered in his eyes kieli let his mind wander a few moments as he wondered who would be chosen to sit at his side for while kieli lingered on the mountain waiting for his vision from the gods his father would be meeting with the father of one of the young girls of the local villages there were three possible mates for kieli from his own village rapanuana smoke in the forests daughter janatua many broken spears daughter and eye of the bluewinged teal daughter of sings to the wind eye of the bluewinged teal was a year older and had gained her womans name the year before but there had been no boy of the right age in the local villages to pledge her to this year there were six including kieli she possessed a strange sense of humor that made kieli wonder what she found funny most of the time she often seemed amused by him and he felt awkward when she was near though he hid it well he was more than a little scared of her but rapanuana was fat and illtempered and janatua was pinchfaced and shy to the point of being speechless around boys eye of the bluewinged teal had a strong tall body and fierce honeycolored eyes that narrowed when she laughed her skin was lighter than the other girls and scattered with freckles and her heartshaped face was surrounded by a mane of hair the color of summers wheat he prayed to the gods that his father had met with her father the night before midsummer and not with one of the other girls fathers then with a surge of panic he realized his father might have met with the father of one of the girls from closeby villages the slowwitted pialua or the pretty but always complaining nandia he sighed it was out of his hands stories were told of men and women who longed for one another sagas told by the storytellers around the fire many of them borrowed from singers from the lowlands as they passed through the mountains of the orosini yet it was his peoples way that a father would choose a bride for his son or a husband for his daughter occasionally a boy no he corrected himself a man would return from his gods vision and discover that no bride waited to sit next to him at his manhood festival and he would have to wait another year for a bride rarely a man would discover that no father wished his daughter wed to him and he would have to depart the village to find himself a wife or resign himself to live alone he had heard of a widow once whose father had died before her husband and she had taken one such man to her hut but no one considered that a proper marriage he sighed again he longed for this to be over he wanted food and to rest in his own bed and he wanted eye of the bluewinged teal even though she made him uncomfortable upwind he caught a sound he knew to be a sow bear with cubs she sounded alarmed and kieli knew her cubs would be scampering up a tree at her warning kieli sat up what would alarm a black bear this close to the mountain a big cat might if a leopard or cougar was ranging nearby they were too high up for the big cave lions maybe a wyvern was hunting he thought feeling suddenly small and vulnerable out on the face of the rocks a small cousin to a dragon a wyvern could hold off half a dozen or more skilled warriors so a boy with only a ceremonial dagger and a gourd of water would make a very satisfying break of fast for such a beast hunting packs might frighten the sow bear wild dogs and wolves usually avoided bears but a cub was a manageable meal if they could draw the sow away from one of her babies or it could be men in the distance the circle of buzzards grew the boy got to his feet to gain a better view and was suddenly gripped with a lightheadedness for he had stood up too quickly steadying himself with one hand upon the rocks he gazed into the distance the sun was now high enough that the haze of morning had burned off and he could clearly see the buzzards and kites wheeling in the distance kielis sight was legendary in his village for few could see as far as he and none in the memory of his clan could see better his grandfather joked that whatever else he lacked he had a hawks eyes for a long moment kielis eyes saw without him comprehending then suddenly he realized the birds were circling over kapoma village alarm shot up through him like a spark and without hesitation he started down the trail kapoma was the village nearest to his own there was only one possible explanation for so many carrioneaters above kapoma a battle he felt the panic rise up in him moreover no one was clearing away the dead if marauders were ranging through the valleys kulaam would be the next village they raided his mind reeled at the thought of his family fighting without him twice as a boy he had stayed in the round house with the women while the men had defended their village from attack once it had been a clan fight with the men from the village of kahanama and another time a goblin raiding party had sought children for their unholy sacrifices but the stout stockade had proven sufficient to repulse the invaders who could it be he wondered as he stumbled down the path toward the trees below the morehdel those the lowlanders called the brotherhood of the dark path had not been seen in these regions since his grandfathers boyhood and the trolls usually gave the villages of the orosini a wide berth there were no clan feuds currently being fought the people who lived in the high reaches to the northeast were currently peaceful and latagore and the duchy of farinda to the south had no issues with the orosini raiders then slavers from the city of inaska or watchers point down in miskalon would sometimes venture into the mountains the tall strong red and blondhaired orosini fetched high value on the slavers blocks down in the empire of great kesh fear overtook kieli he felt it start to freeze his mind he drank what little water and herbs he had left secured the gourd around his waist with a cord then took half a dozen wobbly steps down the trail and lost his footing attempting to catch himself with his outstretched right hand the youth fell and twisted falling hard into a large rock pain shot through him and his head swam as he realized he had injured his left arm it didnt feel broken but there was already a massive red mark running from his shoulder down to the elbow which would turn to a deep bruise it hurt when he moved it he tried to stand and his stomach heaved from the pain and he sat down and vomited kielis vision swam and the landscape turned a vivid yellow and he fell back upon the road the sky above turned brilliant white and the heat seared his face as he gazed upward his eyes gradually losing focus the ground beneath him spun until everything was swept away as he fell through a tunnel into darkness pain woke him he opened his eyes as it seared through his left arm his field of vision narrowed contracting and expanding for a moment as dizziness washed through him then he saw it on his arm flexing slightly rested what looked like a spread talon kieli didnt move his head just shifted his eyes barely inches from his nose stood a silver hawk one leg bent as it rested its talon upon his arm its claws digging into the skin but not piercing it almost as if seeking to wake the stunned youth the hawk flexed its claws again dug deeper kieli found himself looking into the birds black eyes the birds claws tightened again and pain shot though his arm again kielis eyes locked on the birds and then the words came rise little brother rise and be a talon for your people as you feel my talon upon your arm remember you can hold and protect or you can rend and revenge kieli heard the words in his mind suddenly he pushed himself upright and stood bearing the hawk on his arm the birds wings flared as it kept its balance pain was forgotten for a moment as kieli stood facing the bird the hawk stared back then bobbed its head as if nodding agreement their eyes locked once more and then with a screech the bird leapt upward a single snap of its wings taking it right past the young mans ear kieli felt another slight pain and reached up to touch his right shoulder his eyes saw upon his arm the pinprick marks of the birds claws was this my vision he wondered silently no hawk had ever behaved so in the history of his people then with a dull shock he remembered his reason for hurrying down the mountain the heat of the day still baked the rocks around him he felt weak and his left arm throbbed but his mind was clear and he knew he would reach the creek he picked his way carefully among the rocks seeking good footing lest he fall again and suffer further injury if there was a fight coming to his people injured arm or not he was now a man and would stand with his father uncles and grandfather to defend his home kieli stumbled down the dusty trail his left arm sending jolts of agony up into his shoulder with every movement he summoned up a chant a mindnumbing exercise that would reduce the pain and softly intoned it in rhythm soon he felt less pain though the chant didnt work as well as his grandfather had told him it would his arm still hurt but at least it wasnt making him dizzy from pain he reached the creek and fell forward into it his arm suddenly exploding in hot agony at that foolish choice he gasped and was rewarded with a choking mouthful of water then he rolled over on his back and spat out water clearing his nose as he sat up coughing for a moment at last he rolled over onto his knees and drank he filled his gourd quickly tied it again around his waist then resumed his journey he was starving but the water had settled down his thinking it was a twohour walk to his village if he ran at a steady pace he would be there in a third of that time but with his injured arm and in his weakened condition he couldnt sustain any sort of steady run below the creek he entered the heavy woodlands where he felt the days heat lessen then settled for a fast walk jogging over open stretches of trail moving as quietly as he could his mind focused on the coming struggle as he neared his village kieli heard the sounds of fighting he smelled smoke a womans scream pierced his heart as sharply as if a blade had struck could that be his own mother no matter he knew that whoever it was it was a woman he had known all his life he took the ceremonial dagger and held it tightly in his right hand how he wished he had two good arms and a sword or spear in the heat of the day he had not felt the need for his usual clothing though he had missed his cloak and tunic at night but now he felt particularly vulnerable even so he hurried along the anticipation of the combat to come dulling the pain in his arm and forcing his fatigue aside choking clouds of smoke accompanied by the sound of flames warned him of the devastation that greeted him a moment later he reached the point in the trail where it left the woodlands and passed between the villages large vegetable gardens before reaching the stockade the gate was open as it was during peaceful times no enemy had ever attacked on midsummers day which was a day of almost universal truce even during time of war the condition of the wooden walls and the surrounding earthen foundations below told the boy that the enemy had rushed through the gate before the alarm had sounded most of the villagers would have been in the central square preparing the feast everywhere was flame and smoke he could see figures in the smoke many on horseback and the outlines of bodies on the ground kieli paused to run down the trail would make him a target better to circle along the line of the wood until reaching the point closest to the village behind many fine horsess home as he moved to his right he found the smoke blowing away from him now he could see the carnage in the village many of his friends lay motionless upon the ground it was hard to make sense of the tableau before him men on horseback wearing various styles of clothing and armor rode through the village several bearing torches firing the houses mercenaries or slavers kieli knew then he saw footmen wearing the tabard of the duke of olasko ruler of the powerful duchy to the southeast but why would they be aiding raiders in the mountains of the orosini reaching the back of many fine horsess home kieli crept along he saw an olaskan soldier lying motionless just beyond the edge of the building casting aside his dagger kieli decided to make a run for the mans sword if no one noticed he would attempt to remove the round shield on the mans left arm as well it would hurt to carry the shield on his injured arm but it could also mean the difference between life and death the sound of fighting was coming from the other side of the village so he thought it possible he might be able to fall upon the invaders from behind creeping forward he retrieved the shield and sword and paused for a moment in the smoke he could faintly discern figures moving in the distance cries of outrage and pain drifted toward him as his people struggled to repel the invaders his eyes smarted from the acrid smoke and he blinked back tears as he reached the fallen soldier he turned over the body to retrieve the sword and as his hand fell upon the hilt the soldiers eyes snapped open kieli froze and as he yanked back the sword the soldier lashed out with his shield bashing him in the face kieli fell back his vision swimming and the world seemingly tilting under his feet only his natural quickness saved him for just as the soldier was on his feet dagger drawn and slashed at him kieli dodged for a second he thought he had avoided the blade then pain erupted across his chest and he felt blood flowing it was a shallow wound but a long one running from just under his left collarbone down to his right nipple and there to the bottom of his ribs kieli slashed with his own blade and felt shock run up his arm as the soldier deftly took the blow on his shield another attack and the boy knew that he was overmatched for he only narrowly avoided death from a dagger slash to the stomach had the soldier attacked with his sword instead of a short blade kieli knew hed be lying gutted upon the ground fear threatened to rise up and overwhelm him then but the thought of his family fighting for their lives only yards beyond the masking smoke forced it aside seeing the boys hesitation the soldier grinned wickedly and closed in kieli knew that his only advantage was the length of his blade so he offered his alreadywounded chest as a target and clumsily raised the sword with both hands as if to bring it crashing down upon the soldiers head as kieli had hoped the soldier reflexively raised his shield to take the blow and drew back his dagger for the killing thrust kieli however dropped to his knees with a spin bringing his sword down and around in a powerful arc which sliced through the soldiers leg knocking him backward screaming blood sprayed from the severed arteries just below his knee leaping to his feet kieli stepped upon the mans dagger hand and struck straight down with the swords point into the mans throat ending his agony he tried to wipe his sword hand dry but discovered that blood was flowing freely from the long cut on his chest and knew hed soon be weakening if he didnt bind it though he thought it probably looked a great deal worse than it was as he hurried toward the sounds of battle a gust of wind cleared his vision for a moment so that he had a clean line of sight and could see the villages central square the tables that had been heavily laden with food and ale were overturned the ground around them littered with the feast for the days celebration the flower garlands were crushed into mud made up of soil and blood for a panicstricken second kieli faltered horror causing his gorge to rise he blinked back tears though whether they were caused by smoke or rage he didnt know a short distance away lay the bodies of three children obviously cut down from behind as they raced for shelter beyond them he could see the men of his village making a stand before the round house kieli knew the women and surviving children would be inside the women armed with knives and daggers to defend the children should the men fall men he had known all his life were being slaughtered despite fighting with desperation to protect their families the soldiers had set up a shield wall and were pressing in with spears leveled while behind them sat mounted soldiers calmly loading and firing crossbows into the villagers the orosini bowmen responded but the battles outcome was obvious even to a boy like kieli he knew he would not survive this day but even so he could not stand behind the invaders and not do whatever was in his power on wobbly legs he started forward his target a man upon a black horse obviously the leader of these murderers next to him sat another horseman wearing a black tunic and trousers his hair was as dark as his clothing pulled back behind his ears and falling to his shoulders the man somehow sensed something was behind him for he turned just as kieli started to run kieli saw the mans face clearly a dark beard trimmed close to his jawline a long nose which gave him a harsh appearance and pursed lips as if he had been lost in thought before he heard kielis charge the riders eyes widened slightly at the sight of the armed and bloody boy then he calmly said something to the officer who turned the man in black carefully lifted his arm there was a small crossbow in his hand he calmly took aim kieli knew he had to strike before the mans finger tightened on the release but two strides away from the horseman the boys knees weakened kielis newly acquired sword felt as if it had been fashioned of lead and stone and his arm refused to obey his command to deliver a killing blow to the invader the boy was one stride away when the blackclad man fired the crossbow then his knees buckled the bolt had taken him in the chest high up in the muscle below his first wound the bolt spun him around completely and his blood splattered both men as it fountained from the wound the sword flew backward from fingers that could no longer grip his knees struck the ground and he fell over backward his eyes losing focus as pain and shock swept over him voices shouted but the sound was muted and he could not understand what they were saying for a brief instant he saw something high in the sky above him a silver hawk flew in a circle and to kieli it seemed to be looking directly down at him in his mind he heard the voice once again linger little brother for your time is not yet be my talon and rend our enemies his last thought was of the bird
