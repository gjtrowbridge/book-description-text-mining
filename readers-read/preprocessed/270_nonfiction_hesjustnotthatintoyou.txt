 chapter one hes just not that into you if hes not asking you out because if he likes you trust me he will ask you out many women have said to me greg men run the world wow that makes us sound pretty capable so tell me why would you think we could be incapable of something as simple as picking up the phone and asking you out you seem to think at times that were too shy or we just got out of something let me remind you men find it very satisfying to get what they want particularly after a difficult day of running the world if we want you we will find you if you dont think you gave him enough time to notice you take the time it took you to notice him and divide it by half now you begin the lifechanging experience of reading our book we have put the stories we have heard and questions weve been asked in a simple questionandanswer format if youre lucky youll read the following questions and know what they are excuses that women have made for their unsatisfying situations if youre not so lucky weve also included handy titles to clue you in the maybe he doesnt want to ruin the friendship excuse dear greg im so disappointed i have this friend that ive known platonically for about ten years he lives in a different city and recently he was in town for work so we met for dinner all of a sudden it felt like we were on a date he was completely flirting with me he even said to me as he was checking me out so what youre working the whole model thing now thats flirting right we both agreed that we should get together again soon well greg im disappointed because its been two weeks and he hasnt called me can i call him he might be nervous about turning the friendship into romance cant i give him a nudge now isnt that what friends are for jodi dear friendly girl two weeks is two weeks except when its ten years and two weeks thats how long ago he decided whether or not he could date a model or a girl who looks like one can you be a pal and give him a nudge nudge away friendster but watch how fast that nudge doesnt get a return phone call and if your dinnerdate did feel different to him its been two weeks and hes had time to think about it and decide hes just not that into you heres the truth guys dont mind messing up a friendship if it could lead to sex whether it be a fuck buddy situation or a meaningful romance go find someone that lives in your zip code who will be rocked to the core by your deep conversation and model looks i hate to tell you but that whole i dont want to ruin the friendship excuse is a racket it works so well because it seems so wise sex could mess up a friendship unfortunately in the entire history of mankind that excuse has never ever been used by someone who actually means it if were really excited about someone we cant stop ourselves we want more if were friends with someone and attracted to them were going to want to take it further and please dont tell me hes just scared the only thing hes scared of and i say this with a lot of love is how not attracted to you he is the maybe hes intimidated by me excuse dear greg i have a crush on my gardener hes been potting the plants on my patio it was hot i saw him without his shirt on he was hot and now im hot for him i brought out some beers and we talked i think he wants to ask me out but is afraid because he is my hired man in this situation cant i ask him out cherie dear my secret garden hes capable of asking you out havent you ever seen a porno hope he gets there before the pizza guy but seriously if he didnt pick up the vibe after the beer garden it has nothing to do with you being his big boss lady time to stop and smell the bad news hes just not that into you let me say it again sexual harassment rules and workplace memos notwithstanding a guy will ask out a woman of higher status if hes into her he might need a little more encouragement than normal ill give you that you might have to lead johnny the office boy or phillipe the exterminator to water but you better not help him ask you out once again ladies a wink and a smile will do it by the way why are you dating the exterminator just kidding hes a good guy the maybe he wants to take it slow excuse dear greg theres this guy who calls me all the time hes recently divorced and in aa we got back in touch recently had lots of phone calls and then hung out twice in one week and it was real cool no flirting or making out or anything but fun since then he calls me all the time but doesnt ever suggest we see each other in person again its like he got scared or something i would understand if because of the divorcealcoholicstartingawholenewlife stuff he wanted to take things slow but he still calls me all the time to have long hearttoheart talks what the hell should i do with this guy jen dear pillow talk sadly not wanting to see you in person is massive as far as dating obstacles go and as far as the recently divorcednewly soberstartinganewlife parts blah blah blah im getting sleepy its hot im going down for a nap when i wake up from that nap ill probably thrill to the news that your friend is taking control of his life you however will still not be going on a date because despite all your excuses for him hes still not asking you out now if youre a person who enjoys a slightly satisfying phone relationship talk on but at this point it seems like hes just not that into you be his friend if youre at all interested on that level but move your romantic inclinations onto a more suitable future husband if a guy truly likes you but for personal reasons he needs to take things slow he will let you know that immediately he wont keep you guessing because hell want to make sure you dont get frustrated and go away the but he gave me his number excuse dear greg i met a really cute guy at a bar this week he gave me his number and told me to give him a call sometime i thought that was kind of cool that he gave me control of the situation like that i can call him right lauren dear control freak did he give you control or did he just get you to do the heavy lifting what he just did was a magic trick it seems like he gave you control but really he now gets to decide if he wants to go out with you or even return your call why dont you take copperfields number roll it in a newspaper pour milk in it and make it disappear give me a call email me tell joey we should all hang out sometime dont let him trick you into asking him out when men want you they do the work i know it sounds old school but when men like women they ask them out the maybe he forgot to remember me excuse dear greg okay greg listen to this one i was at a conference for work and met a guy from another branch of my company we hit it off immediately he was just about to ask for my number i swear when the big blackout of 2003 happened in the mayhem i didnt get to give him my number i think the big blackout of 2003 is a good enough excuse to call him dont you think its only common courtesy for me to check up on him right if i dont call hes probably going to be all sad thinking that im just not that into him judy dear judy blackout the city blacked out he didnt you said you work for different branches of the same company certainly he wouldnt have to break a sweat to scroll through the company staff roster or interoffice email listing to find you and should he not be as resourceful as you arei imagine that he has a mother sister or female friend that could show him how if he was really interested ps shame on you for using an eastern seaboard disaster as an excuse to call a guy up have faith you made an impression leave it at that if he likes you hell still remember you after the tsunami flood or red sox loss if he doesnt hes not worth your time know why you are great now dont get cocky the maybe i dont want to play games excuse dear greg this is dumb i know youre not supposed to call guys but i call guys all the time because i dont care i dont want to play games i do whatever i want ive called guys tons of times youre such a square greg why do you think we cant call guys and ask them out nikki dear nikki because we dont like it okay some guys might like it but theyre just lazy and who wants to go out with lazy guy its that simple i didnt make the rules and i might not even agree with them please dont be mad at me nikki im not advocating that women go back to the stone age i just think you might want to be realistic in how capable you are of changing the primordial impulses that drive all of human nature or maybe youre the chosen one men for the most part like to pursue women we like not knowing if we can catch you we feel rewarded when we do especially when the chase is a long one we know there was a sexual revolution we loved it we know women are capable of running governments heading multinational corporations and raising loving children sometimes all at the same time that however doesnt make men different its so simple imagine right now that im leaping up and down and shaking my fist at the sky im on my knees pleading with you im saying this in a loud voice please if you can trust one thing i say in this book let it be this when it comes to men deal with us as we are not how youd like us to be i know its an infuriating concept that men like to chase and you have to let us chase you i know its insulting its frustrating its unfortunately the truth my belief is that if you have to be the aggressor if you have to pursue if you have to do the asking out nine times out of ten hes just not that into you and we want you to believe youre one of the nine ladies i cant say it loud enough you the superfox reading this book are worth asking out heres why this one is hard by liz well its obvious are you telling us that we have to just sit around and wait i dont know about you but i find that infuriating i was brought up to believe that hard work and good planning are the keys to making your dreams come true i spent my life making things happen for myself i worked hard for my career and was quite aggressive about it i called people made appointments asked for favors i took action but now greg is telling us that in this situation we are supposed to do absolutely nothing the guys get to pick were just supposed to put on our little dresses and do our hair and bat our eyes and hope they choose us why dont you just tie my corset too tight so i can faint in front of some man wholl scoop me out of the way just before the horsedrawn carriage runs over me thatll get his attention really in this day and age the hardest thing to do for many women particularly me is nothing we like to scheme make phone calls have a plan and im talking about more than just making sure our hair doesnt frizz most women who date i would guess dont have men throwing themselves at them every night of the week sometimes theres a long stretch during which nobodys asking us out so when we see a guy that we feel might be a romantic possibility its even harder for us to take a backseat that opportunity might not come back again for a long time but guess what my way has sucked hasnt worked at all ive never had a successful relationship with a guy that ive pursued im sure there are many stories out there to the contrary but for me those guys end up getting back together with their exgirlfriend needing to take some time for themselves or going out of town for business usually it doesnt even get that far they usually just dont ever return my phone call and let me tell you that didnt make me feel very in control of anything since ive been implementing gregs handydandy hes just not that into you philosophy ive been feeling surprisingly more powerful because if the men are asking you out if the men have to get your attention then you in fact are the one in control theres no scheming and plotting and there is something great about knowing that my only job is to be as happy as i can be about my life and feel as good as i can about myself and to lead as full and eventful a life as i can so that it doesnt ever feel like im just waiting around for some guy to ask me out and most importantly its good for us all to remember that we dont need to scheme and plot and beg to get someone to ask us out were fantastic this is what it should look like by greg one night i was drinking in a bar and flirting with the bartender i asked for her number she said i dont give out my phone number because guys rarely call me when they say theyre going to my name is lindsey adams and if you want to call me find my phone number which i did the very next day do you know how many lindsey adams there are in the phone book of a major city lets just say i talked to about eight or nine before i found mine an actor we work with met a girl while he was making a public appearance on an aircraft carrier he lost track of her in about ten minutes and yet because he was so smitten he somehow managed to track her down in the army and they are now married greg i get it by leslie age 29 greg i get it i went to this party and i met this guy we started talking immediately by ourselves off in a corner he asked if i was single and seemed pleased when i said i was whenever we split up to talk to other people or to get drinks or whatever he always kept his eye on me it was really cool i was all excited and fluttery with that oh my god i think i just met someone feeling he didnt ask for my number but we know lots of people in common so i thought he was just playing it cool he never called me and you know what normally i would call our mutual friends and start fishing and trying to figure out what happened and maybe try to find another way to see him again but instead im just going to move on who cares what his deal is hes not asking me out so why should i start obsessing over him im just going to go out tonight and try to meet someone else if you dont believe greg we did an incredibly unscientific poll where we polled twenty of our male friends ranging from ages twentysix to fortyfive who are in serious longterm relationships not one of their relationships started with the woman asking them out first one guy even said that if she had it would have spoiled all the fun what you should have learned in this chapter 149 an excuse is a polite rejection men are not afraid of ruining the friendship 149 dont get tricked into asking him out if he likes you hell do the asking 149 if you can find him then he can find you if he wants to find you he will 149 just because you like to lead doesnt mean he wants to dance some traditions are born of nature and last through time for a reason 149 hey lets meet at soandsos partyany barfriends house is not a date even if you live in new york 149 men dont forget how much they like you so put down the phone 149 you are good enough to be asked out our supergood really helpful workbook hey whats a selfhelp tome without a workbook our chapters will all be so brave and wise that we want to make sure you retain as much of the brilliance as you can so for all of you who feel the need to get out of your problems and into your crayon box have at it love greg and liz remember in grade school how they told you not to write in your textbooks screw that grab a pen and list five reasons why you think you have every right or good reason to call him 1 2 3 4 5 put the book aside and wait an hour or at least ten minutes then ask yourself do i seem pathetic do i sound like someone who doesnt trust my own innate hotness yesyou do now put your dialing finger away get out of the house and go find some fun ps you just did a workbook exercise about a guy who hasnt even extended to you the energy of a phone call why would you want to chase that down
