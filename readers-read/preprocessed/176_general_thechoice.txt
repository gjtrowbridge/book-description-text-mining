 tell me again why i agreed to help you with this matt redfaced and grunting continued to push the spa toward the recently cut square at the far edge of the deck his feet slipped and he could feel sweat pouring from his forehead into the corners of his eyes making them sting it was hot way too hot for early may too damn hot for this thats for sure even traviss dog moby was hiding in the shade and panting his tongue hanging out travis parker who was pushing the massive box alongside him managed to shrug because you thought it would be fun he said he lowered his shoulder and shoved the spamdashwhich must have weighed four hundred poundsmdashmoved another couple of inches at this rate the spa should be in place oh sometime next week this is ridiculous matt said heaving his weight into the box thinking that what they really needed was a team of mules his back was killing him for a moment he visualized his ears blowing off the sides of his head from the strain shooting in both directions like the bottle rockets he and travis used to launch as kids youve already said that and it isnt fun matt grunted you said that too and it isnt going to be easy to install sure it is travis said he stood and pointed to the lettering on the box see it says right here easy to install from his spot beneath the shady tree mobymdasha purebred boxermdashbarked as if in agreement and travis smiled looking way too pleased with himself matt scowled trying to catch his breath he hated that look well not always most of the time he enjoyed his friends boundless enthusiasm but not today definitely not today matt reached for the bandanna in his rear pocket it was soaked with sweat which had of course done wonders for the seat of his pants he wiped his face and wrung the bandanna with a quick twist sweat dribbled from it like a leaky faucet onto the top of his shoe he stared at it almost hypnotically before feeling it soak through the light mesh fabric giving his toes a nice slimy feel oh that was just dandy wasnt it as i recall you said joe and laird would be here to help us with your little project and that megan and allison would cook some burgers and wed have beer and thatmdashoh yeah installing this thing should only take a couple of hours at the most theyre coming travis said you said that four hours ago they must be running a little late maybe you never called them at all of course i called them and theyre bringing the kids too i promise when soon uhhuh matt answered he stuffed the bandanna back in his pocket and by the waymdashassuming they dont arrive soon just how on earth do you think the two of us will be able to lower this thing into place travis dismissed the problem with a wave as he turned toward the box again well figure it out just think how well weve done so far were almost halfway there matt scowled again it was saturdaymdashsaturday his day of recreation and relaxation his chance to escape from the grindstone the break he earned after five days at the bank the kind of day he needed he was a loan officer for gods sake he was supposed to push paper not hot tubs he could have been watching the braves play the dodgers he could have been golfing he could have gone to the beach he could have slept in with liz before heading to her parents house like they did almost every saturday instead of waking at the crack of dawn and performing manual labor for eight straight hours beneath a scalding southern sun he paused who was he kidding had he not been here he would have definitely spent the day with lizs parents which was in all honesty the main reason hed agreed to traviss request in the first place but that wasnt the point the point was he didnt need this he really didnt i dont need this he said i really dont travis didnt seem to hear him his hands were already on the box and he was getting into position you ready matt lowered his shoulder feeling bitter his legs were shaking shaking he already knew hed be in serious doubledoseof advil pain in the morning unlike travis he didnt make it into the gym four days a week or play racquetball or go running or go scuba diving in aruba or surfing in bali or skiing in vail or anything else the guy did this isnt fun you know travis winked you said that already remember wow joe commented lifting an eyebrow as he walked the perimeter of the hot tub by then the sun was beginning its descent streams of gold reflecting off the bay in the distance a heron broke from the trees and gracefully skimmed the surface dispersing the light joe and megan along with laird and allison had arrived a few minutes before with kids in tow and travis was showing them around this looks great you two did all of this today travis nodded holding his beer it wasnt so bad he said i think matt even enjoyed it joe glanced at matt who lay flattened in a lawn chair off to the side of the deck a cold rag over his head even his bellymdashmatt had always been on the pudgy sidemdashseemed to sag i can see that was it heavy like an egyptian sarcophagus matt croaked one of those gold ones that only cranes can move joe laughed can the kids get in not yet i just filled it and the water will take a little while to heat up the sun will help though the sun will heat it within minutes matt moaned within seconds joe grinned laird and the three of them had gone to school together since kindergarten tough day matt matt removed the rag and scowled at joe you have no idea and thanks for showing up on time travis said to be here at five if i had known you needed help i would have come earlier matt slowly shifted his gaze to travis he really hated his friend sometimes hows tina doing travis said changing the subject is megan getting any sleep megan was chatting with allison at the table on the far end of the deck and joe glanced briefly in her direction some tinas cough is gone and shes been able to sleep through the night again but sometimes i just think that megan isnt wired to sleep at least not since she became a mom she gets up even if tina hasnt made a peep its like the quiet wakes her up shes a good mom travis said she always has been joe turned to matt wheres liz he asked she should be here any minute matt answered his voice floating up as if from the dead she spent the day with her parents lovely joe commented be nice theyre good people i seem to recall you saying that if you had to sit through one more of your fatherinlaws stories about his prostate cancer or listen to your motherinlaw fret about henry getting fired againmdash even though it wasnt his faultmdashyou were going to stick your head in the oven matt struggled to sit up i never said that yes you did joe winked as matts wife liz rounded the corner of the house with ben toddling just in front of her but dont worry i wont say a word matts eyes darted nervously from liz to joe and back again checking to see if shed heard hey yall liz called out with a friendly wave leading little ben by the hand she made a beeline for megan and allison ben broke away and toddled toward the other kids in the yard joe saw matt sigh in relief he grinned and lowered his voice so matts inlaws is that how you conned him into coming here i might have mentioned it travis smirked joe laughed what are you guys saying matt called out suspiciously nothing they said in unison later with the sun down and the food eaten moby curled up at traviss feet as he listened to the sound of the kids splashing away in the spa travis felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him this was his favorite kind of evening whiled away to the sound of shared laughter and familiar banter one minute allison was talking to joe the next minute she was chatting with liz and then laird or matt and so on for everyone seated around the outdoor table no pretenses no attempts to impress no one trying to show anyone up his life he sometimes thought resembled a beer commercial and for the most part he was content simply to ride the current of good feeling every now and then one of the wives would get up to check on the kids laird joe and matt on the other hand reserved their childrearing duties at times like these to periodically raising their voices in hopes of calming down the kids or preventing them from teasing or accidentally hurting one another sure one of the kids would throw a tantrum now and then but most problems were solved with a quick kiss on a scraped knee or a hug that was as tender to watch from a distance as it must have been for the kid to receive travis looked around the table pleased that his childhood friends not only had become good husbands and fathers but were still a part of his life it didnt always turn out that way at thirtytwo he knew that life was sometimes a gamble and hed survived more than his share of accidents and falls some of which should have inflicted far more serious bodily injury than they had but it wasnt just that life was unpredictable others hed known growing up had already died in car accidents been married and divorced found themselves addicted to drugs or booze or simply moved away from this tiny town their faces already blurring in his memory what were the odds that the four of themmdashwhod known one another since kindergartenmdashwould find themselves in their early thirties still spending weekends together pretty small he thought but somehow after hanging together through all the adolescent acne and girl troubles and pressure from their parents then heading off to four different colleges with differing career goals they had each one by one moved back here to beaufort they were more like family than friends right down to coded expressions and shared experiences that no outsiders could ever fully understand and miraculously the wives got along too theyd come from different backgrounds and different parts of the state but marriage motherhood and the endless gossip of smalltown america were more than enough to keep them chatting regularly on the phone and bonding like longlost sisters laird had been the first to marrymdashhe and allison had tied the knot the summer after they graduated from wake forest joe and megan walked the aisle a year later after falling in love during their senior year at north carolina matt whod gone to duke met liz here in beaufort and they were married a year after that travis had been the best man in all three weddings some things had changed in the past few years of course largely because of the new additions to the families laird wasnt always available to go mountain biking joe couldnt join travis on the spur of the moment to go skiing in colorado as he used to and matt had all but given up trying to keep up with him on most things but that was okay they were all still available enough and among the three of themmdashand with enough planningmdashhe was still able to make the most of his weekends lost in thought travis hadnt realized that the conversation had lapsed did i miss something i asked if youd talked to monica lately megan said her tone letting travis know he was in trouble all six of them he thought took a bit too much interest in his love life the trouble with married people was that they seemed to believe that everyone they knew should get married every woman travis dated was thus subjected to subtle though unyielding evaluation especially by megan she was usually the ringleader at moments like these always trying to figure out what made travis tick when it came to women and travis of course loved nothing more than to push her buttons in return not recently he said why not shes nice shes also more than a little neurotic travis thought but that was beside the point she broke up with me remember so it doesnt mean she doesnt want you to call i thought thats exactly what it meant megan along with allison and liz stared at him as if he were just plain dense the guys as usual seemed to be enjoying this it was a regular feature of their evenings but you were fighting right so did you ever think she might have simply broken up with you because she was angry i was angry too why she wanted me to see a therapist and let me guessmdashyou said you didnt need to see one the day i need to see a therapist is the day you see me hike up my skirt and crochet some mittens joe and laird laughed but megans eyebrows shot up megan they all knew watched oprah nearly every day you dont think men need therapy i know i dont but generally speaking since im not a general i really couldnt say megan leaned back in her chair i think monica might be on to something if you ask me i think you have commitment issues then ill make sure not to ask you megan leaned forward whats the longest youve ever dated someone two months four months travis pondered the question i dated olivia for almost a year i dont think shes talking about high school laird cracked occasionally his friends enjoyed throwing him under the bus so to speak thanks laird travis said what are friends for youre changing the subject megan reminded him travis drummed his fingers on his leg i guess id have to say i cant remember in other words not long enough to remember what can i say ive yet to meet any woman who could measure up to any of you despite the growing darkness he could tell she was pleased by his words hed learned long ago that flattery was his best defense at moments like these especially since it was usually sincere megan liz and allison were terrific all heart and loyalty and generous common sense well just so you know i like her she said yeah but you like everyone i date no i dont i didnt like leslie none of the wives had liked leslie matt laird and joe on the other hand hadnt minded her company at all especially when she wore her bikini she was definitely a beauty and while she wasnt the type hed ever marry theyd had a lot of fun while it lasted im just saying that i think you should give her a call she persisted ill think about it he said knowing he wouldnt he rose from the table angling for an escape anyone need another beer joe and laird lifted their bottles in unison the others shook their heads travis started for the cooler before hesitating near the sliding glass door of his house he darted inside and changed the cd listening to the strains of new music filtering out over the yard as he brought the beers back to the table by then megan allison and liz were already chatting about gwen the woman who did their hair gwen always had good stories many of which concerned the illicit predilections of the towns citizens travis nursed his beer silently looking out over the water what are you thinking about laird asked its not important what is it travis turned toward him did you ever notice how some colors are used for peoples names but others arent what are you talking about white and black like mr white the guy who owns the tire store and mr black our thirdgrade teacher or even mr green from the game clue but you never hear of someone named mr orange or mr yellow its like some colors make good names but other colors just sound stupid you know what i mean i cant say ive ever thought about it me neither not until just a minute ago i mean but its kind of strange isnt it sure laird finally agreed both men were quiet for a moment i told you it wasnt important yes you did was i right yep when little josie had her second temper tantrum in a fifteenminute spanmdashit was a little before ninemdashallison scooped her into her arms and gave laird the look the one that said it was time to go so they could get the kids in bed laird didnt bother arguing and when he stood up from the table megan glanced at joe liz nodded at matt and travis knew the evening was at an end parents might believe themselves to be the bosses but in the end it was the kids who made the rules he supposed he could have tried to talk one of his friends into staying and might even have gotten one to agree but he had long since grown accustomed to the fact that his friends lived their lives by a different schedule from his besides he had a sneaking suspicion that stephanie his younger sister might swing by later she was coming in from chapel hill where she was working toward a masters degree in biochemistry though she would stay at their parents place she was usually wired after the drive and in the mood to talk and their parents would already be in bed megan joe and liz rose and started to clean up the table but travis waved them off ill get it in a while no big deal a few minutes later two suvs and a minivan were being loaded with children travis stood on the front porch and waved as they pulled out of the driveway when they were gone travis wandered back to the stereo sorted through the cds again and chose tattoo you by the rolling stones then cranked up the volume he pulled at another beer on his way back to his chair threw his feet up on the table and leaned back moby sat beside him just you and me for a while he said what time do you think stephanie will be rolling in moby turned away unless travis said the words walk or ball or go for a ride or come get a bone moby wasnt much interested in anything he had to say do you think i should call her to see if shes on her way yet moby continued to stare yeah thats what i thought shell get here when she gets here he sat drinking his beer and stared out over the water behind him moby whined you want to go get your ball he finally said moby stood so quickly he almost knocked over the chair it was the music she thought that proved to be the clincher in what had already been one of the most miserable weeks of her life loud music okay nine oclock on a saturday night wasnt so bad especially since he obviously had company and ten oclock wasnt all that unreasonable either but eleven oclock when he was alone and playing fetch with his dog from her back deck she could see him just sitting there in the same shorts hed worn all day feet on the table tossing the ball and staring at the river what on earth could he be thinking maybe she shouldnt be so hard on him she should simply ignore him it was his house right king of the castle and all that he could do what he wanted but that wasnt the problem the problem was that he had neighbors including her and she had a castle too and neighbors were supposed to be considerate and truth be told hed crossed the line not just because of the music in all honesty she liked the music he was listening to and usually didnt really care how loud or how long he played it the problem was with his dog nobby or whatever he called him more specifically what his dog had done to her dog molly she was certain was pregnant molly her beautiful sweet purebred collie of prizewinning lineagemdashthe first thing shed bought herself after finishing her physician assistant rotations at the eastern virginia school of medicine and the kind of dog shed always wantedmdashhad noticeably gained weight during the last couple of weeks even more alarming she noticed that mollys nipples seemed to be growing she could feel them now whenever molly rolled over to have her tummy scratched and she was moving more slowly too add it up and molly was definitely on her way to birthing a litter of puppies that no one on earth was ever going to want a boxer and a collie unconsciously she squinched up her face as she tried to imagine how the puppies would look before finally forcing the thought away it had to be that mans dog when molly was in heat that dog had practically staked out her house like a private detective and he was the only dog shed seen wandering around the neighborhood in weeks but would her neighbor even consider fencing his yard or keeping the dog inside or setting up a dog run no his motto seemed to be my dog shall be free it didnt surprise her he seemed to live his own life by the same irresponsible motto on her way to work she saw him running and when she got back he was out biking or kayaking or inline skating or shooting baskets in his front drive with a group of neighborhood kids a month ago hed put his boat in the water and now he was wakeboarding as well as if the man werent active enough already god forbid the man should work a minute of overtime and she knew that he didnt work at all on fridays and what kind of job let you head off every day wearing jeans and tshirts she had no idea but she suspectedmdashwith a grim sort of satisfactionmdashthat it more than likely required an apron and name tag okay maybe she wasnt being entirely fair he was probably a nice guy his friendsmdashwho appeared normal enough and had kids to bootmdashseemed to enjoy his company and were over there all the time she realized shed even seen a couple of them at the office before when their kids had come in with the sniffles or an ear infection but what about molly molly was sitting near the back door her tail thumping and gabby felt anxious at the thought of the future molly would be okay but what about the puppies what was going to happen to them what if no one wanted them she couldnt imagine taking them to the pound or the spca or whatever it was they called it here to be put to sleep she couldnt do that she wouldnt do that she wasnt going to have them murdered but what then was she going to do with the puppies it was all his fault and he was just sitting there on his deck with his feet propped up acting as if he didnt have a care in the world this wasnt what shed dreamed about when shed first seen the house earlier this year even though it wasnt in morehead city where her boyfriend kevin lived it was just minutes across the bridge it was small and almost half a century old and a definite fixerupper by beaufort standards but the view along the creek was spectacular the yard was big enough for molly to run and best of all she could afford it just barely what with all the loans shed taken out for pa school but loan officers were pretty understanding when it came to making loans to people like her professional educated people not like mr my dog shall be free and i dont work fridays she drew a deep breath reminding herself again that the man might be a nice guy he always waved to her whenever he saw her pulling in from work and she vaguely remembered that hed dropped off a basket of cheese and wine to welcome her to the neighborhood when shed moved in a couple of months back she hadnt been home but hed left it on the porch and shed promised herself that shed send a thankyou note one that she never quite got around to writing her face squinched unconsciously again so much for moral superiority okay she wasnt perfect either but this wasnt about a forgotten thankyou note this was about molly and that mans wandering dog and unwanted puppies and now was as good a time as any for them to discuss the situation he was obviously awake she stepped off the back deck and started toward the tall row of hedges that separated his house from hers part of her wished kevin were with her but that wasnt going to happen not after their spat this morning which started after shed casually mentioned that her cousin was getting married kevin buried in the sports section of the newspaper hadnt said a word in response preferring to act as if he hadnt heard her anything about marriage made the man get as quiet as a stone especially lately she supposed she shouldnt have been surprisedmdashtheyd been dating almost four years a year less than her cousin she was tempted to point out and if shed learned one thing about him it was that if kevin found a topic uncomfortable then more than likely he wouldnt say anything at all but kevin wasnt the problem nor was the fact that lately she felt as though her life werent quite what shed imagined it would be and it wasnt the terrible week at the office either one in which shed been puked on threemdash three mdashtimes on friday alone which was an alltime office record at least according to the nurses who didnt bother to hide their smirks and repeated the story with glee nor was she angry about adrian melton the married doctor at her office who liked to touch her whenever they spoke his hand lingering just a bit too long for comfort and she surely wasnt angry at the fact that through it all she hadnt once stood up for herself nosiree this had to do with mr party being a responsible neighbor one who was going to own up to the fact that he had as much of a duty to find a solution to their problem as she did and while she was letting him know that maybe shed mention that it was a little late for him to be blaring his music even if she did like it just to let him know she was serious as gabby marched through the grass the dew moistened the tips of her toes through her sandals and the moonlight reflected on the lawn like silver trails trying to figure out exactly where to begin she barely noticed courtesy dictated that she head first to the front door and knock but with the music roaring she doubted hed even be able to hear it besides she wanted to get this over with while she was still worked up and willing to confront him headon up ahead she spotted an opening in the hedges and headed toward it it was probably the same one that nobby snuck through to take advantage of poor sweet molly her heart squeezed again and this time she tried to hold on to the feeling this was important very important focused as she was on her mission she didnt notice the tennis ball come flying toward her just as she emerged from the opening she did however distantly register the sound of the dog galloping toward hermdashbut only distantlymdasha second before she was bowled over and hit the ground as she lay on her back gabby noted dully that there were way too many stars in a too bright outoffocus sky for a moment she wondered why she couldnt draw breath then quickly became more concerned with the pain that was coursing through her all she could do was lie on the grass and blink with every throb from somewhere far away she heard a jumble of sounds and the world slowly started coming back into focus she tried to concentrate and realized that it wasnt a jumble she was hearing voices or rather a single voice it seemed to be asking if she was okay at the same time she gradually became conscious of a succession of warm smelly and rhythmic breezes on her cheek she blinked once more turned her head slightly and was confronted with an enormous furry square head towering over her nobby she concluded fuzzily ahhhh she whimpered trying to sit up as she moved the dog licked her face moby down the voice said sounding closer are you okay maybe you shouldnt try to get up yet im okay she said finally raising herself into a seated position she took a couple of deep breaths still feeling dizzy wow she thought that really hurt in the darkness she sensed someone squatting beside her though she could barely make out his features im really sorry the voice said what happened moby accidentally knocked you down he was going after a ball whos moby my dog then whos nobby what she brought a hand to her temple never mind are you sure youre okay yeah she said still dizzy but feeling the pain subside to a low throb as she began to rise she felt her neighbor place his hand on her arm helping her up she was reminded of the toddlers she saw at the office who struggled to stay balanced and remain upright when she finally had her feet under her she felt him release her arm some welcome huh he asked his voice still sounded far away but she knew it wasnt and when she faced him she found herself focusing up at someone at least six inches taller than her own five feet seven she wasnt used to that and as she tilted her head upward she noticed his angled cheekbones and clean skin his brown hair was wavy curling naturally at the ends and his teeth gleamed white up close he was goodlookingmdash okay really goodlookingmdashbut she suspected that he knew it as well lost in thought she opened her mouth to say something then closed it again realizing shed forgotten the question i mean here you are coming over to visit and you get slammed by my dog he went on like i said im really sorry usually he pays a bit more attention say hey moby the dog was sitting on his haunches acting pleased as punch and with that she suddenly remembered the purpose of her visit beside her moby raised a paw in greeting it was cutemdashand he was cute for a boxermdashbut she wasnt about to fall for it this was the mutt whod not only tackled her but ruined molly as well he probably should have been named mugger or better yet pervert you sure youre okay the way he asked made her realize that this wasnt the sort of confrontation shed wanted and she tried to summon the feeling shed had on her way over im fine she said her tone sharp for an awkward moment they eyed each other without speaking finally he motioned over his shoulder with his thumb would you like to sit on the deck im just listening to some music why do you think i want to sit on the deck she snapped feeling more in control he hesitated because you were coming over oh yeah she thought that i mean i suppose we could stand here by the hedges if youd rather he continued she held up her hands to stop him impatient to get this over with i came over here because i wanted to talk to you she broke off when he slapped at his arm me too he said before she could get started again ive been meaning to drop by to officially welcome you to the neighborhood did you get my basket she heard a buzzing near her ear and waved at it yes thank you for that she said slightly distracted but what i wanted to talk about she trailed off when she realized he wasnt paying attention instead he was fanning the air between them you sure you dont want to head to the deck he pressed the mosquitoes are vicious around the bushes here what i was trying to say wasmdash theres one on your earlobe he said pointing her right hand shot up instinctively the other one she swatted at it and saw a smear of blood on her fingers as she pulled her hand back gross she thought theres another right by your cheek she waved again at the growing swarm whats going on like i said its the bushes they breed in the water and its always moist in the shade fine she relented we can talk on the deck a moment later they were in the clear moving quickly i hate mosquitoes which is why ive got some citronella candles going on the table thats usually enough to keep them away they get much worse later in the summer he left just enough space between them so they wouldnt accidentally bump i dont think weve formally met by the way im travis parker she felt a flicker of uncertainty she wasnt here to be his buddy after all but expectation and manners prevailed and she answered before she could stop herself im gabby holland nice to meet you yeah she said she made a point to cross her arms as she said it then subconsciously brought a hand to her ribs where a dull ache remained from there it traveled to her ear which was already beginning to itch staring at her profile travis could tell that she was angry her mouth had a tight pinched look hed seen on any number of girlfriends somehow he knew the anger was directed at him though he had no idea why aside from being tackled by the dog that is but that wasnt quite it he decided he remembered the expressions that his kid sister stephanie was famous for ones that signaled a slow buildup of resentment over time and thats how gabby seemed to be acting now as if shed worked herself up to this but there the similarities with his sister ended while stephanie had grown up to become a certifiable beauty gabby was attractive in a similar but not quite perfect kind of way her blue eyes were a little too wide set her nose was just a bit too big and red hair was always hard to pull off but somehow these imperfections lent an air of vulnerability to her natural good looks which most men would find arresting in the silence gabby tried to collect her thoughts i was coming over becausemdash hold on he said before you begin why dont you sit down ill be right there he started for the cooler then rotated in midstride would you like a beer no thank you she said wishing she could get this over with refusing to sit down she turned with the hope of confronting him as he strode past but too quickly he dropped into his chair leaned back and put his feet on the table flustered gabby continued to stand this was not working out as shed planned he popped open his beer and took a short pull arent you going to sit he asked over his shoulder id rather remain standing thank you i came over here to tell you somethingmdash can you move just a few feet to the side he asked she made an impatient noise and moved a few steps better not yet by then she was almost against the table she threw up her hands in exasperation maybe you should just sit he suggested fine she said she pulled out a chair and took a seat he was throwing this whole thing completely out of whack i came over because i wanted to talk to you she began wondering if she should start with mollys situation or what it generally meant to be a good neighbor he raised his eyebrows youve already said that i know she said ive been trying to tell you but you havent let me finish he saw her glare at him just the way his sister used to but still had no idea what she was so wound up about after a second she began to speak a bit hesitantly at first as if wary that he was going to interrupt her again he didnt and she seemed to find her rhythm the words coming more and more quickly she talked about how shed found the house and how excited shed been and how owning a home had been her dream for a long time before the topic wandered to molly and how mollys nipples were getting bigger at first travis had no idea who molly wasmdashwhich lent that part of the monologue a surreal qualitymdashbut as she continued he gradually realized that molly was gabbys collie which hed noticed her walking occasionally after that she began talking about ugly puppies and murder and strangely something about neither dr handsonme nor vomit having anything to do with the way she was feeling but in all honesty it made little sense until she started gesturing at moby that allowed him to put two and two together until it dawned on him that she believed moby was responsible for molly getting pregnant he wanted to tell her that it wasnt moby but she was on such a roll he thought it best to let her finish before protesting by that point her story had veered back on itself bits and pieces of her life continued to come tumbling out little snippets that sounded unrehearsed and unconnected along with bursts of anger randomly directed his way it felt as though she went on for a good twenty minutes or so but travis knew it couldnt have been that long even so being on the receiving end of a strangers angry accusations about his failures as a neighbor wasnt exactly easy nor did he appreciate the way she was talking about moby moby in his opinion was just about the most perfect dog in the world sometimes she paused and in those moments travis tried unsuccessfully to respond but that didnt work either because she immediately overrode him instead he listened andmdashat least in those moments when she wasnt insulting him or his dogmdash sensed a trace of desperation even some confusion as to what was happening in her life the dog whether she realized it or not was only a small part of what was bothering her he felt a surge of compassion for her and found himself nodding just to let her know he was paying attention every now and then she asked a question but before he could respond she would answer for him arent neighbors supposed to consider their actions yes obviously he started to say but she beat him to it of course they are she cried and travis found himself nodding again when her tirade finally wound down she ended up staring at the ground spent although her mouth was set in that same straight line travis thought he saw tears and he wondered whether he should offer to bring her a tissue they were inside the housemdashtoo far away he realizedmdashbut then he remembered the napkins near the grill he rose quickly grabbed a few and brought them to her he offered her one and after debating she took it she wiped the corner of her eyes now that shed calmed down he noted she was even prettier than hed first realized she drew a shaky breath the question is what are you going to do she finally asked he hesitated trying to draw a bead on what she meant about what the puppies he could hear the anger beginning to percolate again and he raised his hands in an attempt to calm her lets start at the beginning are you sure shes pregnant of course im sure didnt you hear a word i said have you had her checked by a vet im a physician assistant i spent two and a half years in pa school and another year in rotations i know when someones pregnant with people im sure you do but with dogs its different how would you know ive had a lot of experience with dogs actually imdash yeah ill bet she thought cutting him off with a wave shes moving slower her nipples are swollen and shes been acting strangely what else could it be honestly every man shed ever met believed that having a dog as a kid made him an expert on all things canine what if she has an infection that would cause swelling and if the infection is bad enough she might be in some pain too which could explain the way shes acting gabby opened her mouth to speak then closed it when she realized that she hadnt thought of that an infection could cause swelling in the nipplesmdashmastitis or something like thatmdashand for a moment she felt a surge of relief wash through her as she considered it further however reality came crashing back it wasnt one or two nipples it was all of them she twisted the napkin wishing he would just listen shes pregnant and shes going to have puppies and youre going to have to help me find homes for them since im not bringing them to the pound im sure it wasnt moby i knew you were going to say that but you should knowmdash she shook her head furiously this was so typical pregnancy was always a womans problem she stood up from her chair youre going to have to take some responsibility here and i hope you realize its not going to be easy to find homes for them butmdash what on earth was that about stephanie asked gabby had disappeared into the hedge a few seconds later hed seen her enter her home through the sliding glass door he was still sitting at the table feeling slightly shellshocked when he spotted his sister approaching how long have you been here long enough she said she saw the cooler near the door and pulled out a beer for a second there i thought she was going to punch you then i thought she was going to cry and then she looked like she wanted to punch you again thats about right he admitted he rubbed his forehead still processing the scene still charming the girlfriends i see shes not my girlfriend shes my neighbor even better stephanie took a seat how long have you been dating were not actually thats the first time ive ever met her impressive stephanie observed i didnt think you had it in you what you
