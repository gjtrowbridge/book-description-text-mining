 monday may 8 i see you i see you walking by my office trying to look like you have a reason to be there but you dont i see the guilty look on your face you try not to make eye contact you try to rush past me as if youre going to the bathroom but the bathroom is at the other end of the hall you think im nave but i know what youre doing everyone knows but shes my secretary not yours and her candy belongs to me not you and if i have a say in whether or not you ever become a partner at this firm and trust me i do im not going to forget this my secretary my candy go back to your office and finish reading the addendum to the lease agreement i dont want to see you in the hall for at least another sixteen hours and stop stealing my candy and stop stealing my stapler too i shouldnt have to go wandering the halls looking for a stapler im a partner at a halfbilliondollar law firm staplers should be lining up at my desk begging for me to use them so should the young lawyers who think i know their names the short one the dumb one the one with the limp the one whos never getting married the one who missed her kids funeral i dont know who these people really are you in the blue shirt no the other blue shirt i need you to count the number of commas in this threefoottall stack of paper pronto the case is going to trial seven years from now so ill need this done by the time i leave the office today remember i can make or break you i hold your future in my hands i decide whether you get a view of the ocean or a view of the dumpster this isnt a game get back to work my secretary my stapler my candy posted by anonymous at 114 pm tuesday may 9 i can barely do anything this morning knowing theres a living creature in the office next to mine usually its just the corporate securities partner and he hasnt moved a muscle since the carter administration but today he brought his dog into the office ridiculous as if there arent enough animals here already we had fish once piranhas we overfed them we threw the fat guys lunch in the tank one day because he showed up to a meeting fifteen minutes late the fish devoured it turkey sandwich brownie fortyeightounce coke and then exploded it made the point no one shows up late to my meetings anymore but the dog arrived this morning and immediately everyone was in the hallway instead of where they belong staring into their computer screens associates were getting up out of their chairs to go chase the dog pet the dog talk to the dog someone gave the dog a piece of his muffin from the attorney lounge the muffins arent for dogs we dont even let the paralegals have the muffins the muffins are for clientbilling attorneys theyre purely sustenance to keep the lawyers from having to leave the office for breakfast theyre not for visitors i made a note of the incident and ill have a dollarfifty taken off the guys next paycheck the dog barked once i told his owner to keep the dog quiet or id lock him in the document room with the junior associates whove been in there for six weeks searching for a single email in a room full of boxes theres an eerie quiet that normally pervades the halls of the firm punctuated only by the screams of those whove discovered they can use the letter opener to end the pain once and for all id like to keep it that way we dont need barking to drown out our inner turmoil noise is for the monthly happy hour and the annual picnic not the workspace the workspace is sacred i overheard the one who doesnt know how to correctly apply her makeup say the dog really brings some life into this place i dont feel so alone she said i gave her some more work to do shes obviously not busy enough shes supposed to feel alone this isnt the kind of business where people can go into their coworkers offices and fritter away the morning chatting about the weather or the stock market or their relationship issues or playing with a damn dog were a law firm time is billable the client doesnt pay for small talk every minute you spend away from your desk is a minute the firm isnt making any money off your presence even though youre still using the office supplies eating the muffins drinking the coffee consuming the oxygen and adding to the wear and tear on the carpets youre overhead and if youre not earning your keep you shouldnt be here the dog shouldnt be here except hes probably more easily trained than some of my associates if i get him to eat some incriminating evidence we need to destroy i can bill the client a couple hundred dollars an hour for it if i can get him to bark at some opposing counsel and scare them into accepting our settlement offer thats probably billable if i can get him to pee on a secretary it wont be billable but its entertaining nonetheless hardly matters having a dog in the office is almost as ridiculous as holding the elevator for a paralegal inappropriate undesirable and it will not happen when i become chairman of this place i guarantee you that posted by anonymous at 925 am to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date tuesday may 9 140 pm great seeing you over the weekend im glad you came down i was just talking about you at lunch another partner said his son is starting at stanford in the fall and i told him i have a niece whos graduating next month i said id see if youd let me pass along your email address in case his son has any questions his father is a tax lawyer so the sons probably a nut but at least i can get some points for being helpful to my colleagues hell owe me one the next time i need a swing vote at the partner meeting i took a quick look at some of those law student weblogs you told me about they gave me some names to add to the list of kids im never going to hire they also motivated me to start this new email account maybe ill write a weblog of my own ill be anonymous lawyer you can be anonymous niece how does that sound to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date tuesday may 9 223 pm sounds strange but youre the boss anonymous niece is fine feel free to give the tax partner my email address i can tell his son which professors to avoid where to get the best pizza its no problem besides if im nice to his son his dad will help me with my tax assignments once im in law school right to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date tuesday may 9 237 pm you wont need his help im sure youll do quite fine on your own not everyone can get into yale law school im proud of you you know it doesnt look like either of my kids is turning out to be a genius so you might be my only hope dont forget to call your grandma and wish her a happy birthday we talked about you this morning shes happy youre following in my footsteps at least someone in this family is wednesday may 10 the guy with the giant mole quit today associates usually quit in january right after the annual bonus checks but this guy had been trying to go on vacation for three and a half years and never got the chance apparently he woke up one day last week and decided to become a high school teacher thats what happens when you cant cut it the best part of my job is getting to watch people like him go from happy energetic eagertoplease young law school graduates to slightly older frustrated burnedout midlevel associates who cant stand to be here and then it falls to me to replace them thats the power of being the hiring partner at one of the most prestigious law firms on the planet law students love us we have to beat them away with sticks well not anymore at least not literally in the old days the story is they would get some sticks with the firms logo screenprinted on the side and really have some fun with the recruiting process but i think theres an american bar association rule against that now and so we have to use the standard rejection letter i bet it was a lot more fun with the sticks we have students lining up to hand us their rsums yet weve got a 30 percent annual turnover rate and its not just us its everywhere all our peers the whole industry that makes my job a bit of a challenge how to stay positive about selling students on the excellence of this place when we have to make sure the boxes of copier paper arent tied up with rope because that rope is just too tempting one hanging every so often is to be expected but when theres another one every time we get new office supplies it starts to get a little difficult to work at least the ones who kill themselves are admitting the truth once you realize you cant hack it at a place like this that youre not as smart as you thought you were or dont have the discipline to make the sacrifices it takes to succeedthen obviously its not really worth continuing the charade but some dont get the hint they stay until we push them out with a polite suggestion that they might find more appropriate work at dennys ive been informed we have a former associate driving a bus until someone said that i didnt realize we still had buses in this country i fired the person who told me lawyers at this firm shouldnt be riding the bus they shouldnt be using any kind of transportation at all actually they should be here billing clients posted by anonymous at 1051 am to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date wednesday may 10 1058 am im just going to law school i dont know that im following in your footsteps quite yet im sure the work is very exciting at your firm but i think i might want to end up doing something different maybe start a nonprofit or even go into teaching i think im too idealistic to do firm work to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date wednesday may 10 1114 am youll change your mind they all do everyone starts law school with stupid dreams like that but you cant make 160k your first year out of law school working for a nonprofit ill get you a job working here next summer and youll see look at me i didnt think id end up at a law firm but here i am im rich and successful and you can be too to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date wednesday may 10 1127 am i promise ill think about it thursday may 11 i got here ninety seconds later than usual this morning maybe a hundred but definitely not even two minutes walked into the attorney lounge and saw the jerk taking the last bagel split it with you i asked i dont think so he said just like the ibm deal the early bird gets the worm or in that case a pretty major payday he smirked as he walked past me and opened the door back into the hallway and im stuck with a danish i hate that smirk ive hated it for the past eighteen years we both started at the firm on the same day members of the same class of summer associates he was already losing his hair back then he tried to compensate by letting it grow long but he wasnt fooling anyone now he thinks nobody notices when every three years his hairline is magically restored to where it hasnt been naturally for decades some sort of transplant surgery my hair is 100 percent my own no surgery no nothing eighteen years and i dont think weve ever had a civil conversation on the very first day of the summer program i made some throwaway comment about how i couldnt believe we had to waste the first week in training and he replied some of us are here to learn and one of us was apparently there to be a jackass since then its been an open secret that wed each like nothing more than for the other to die in a house fire a brutal painful ugly death causing great misery and not covered by insurance early on i got picked for the hiring committee i thought id be the first thirdyear associate ever put on a committee three days later they told him he was on it too i threw a chair when i found out broke it right in half well dented it at least the only benefit was that i got a new chair usually theres a long wait you need to file a requisition form wait for approval and then youre limited to a certain set of chairs no more expensive than any chair belonging to anyone with more seniority there are thirteen classes of chairs in the catalog for associates and partners to choose from but no secondyear associate can have a class iii chair until all of the thirdyear associates have chairs from that category the hierarchy dictates that we manage the chair situation or sixthyear associates will be getting chairs nicer than the ones the partners have and thats obviously an untenable situation but if your chair breaks you get to bypass the rules and so i got a partnerlevel chair even though i was still an associate i still have that chair its a good chair a few years later the jerk and i both got corner offices one time emboldened by the satisfaction of having made the longest paper clip chain id ever constructed i snuck in and measured mines seven square feet bigger thats fiftytwo extra paper clips in each direction ive always taken that to be a sign seven square feet im that much more valuable we were both named partner the same year the first time our names came up for consideration of course on the same day i got the call to be the hiring partner the jerk was named assistant head of litigation i ripped up a paralegals paycheck when i found out had to vent the frustration somehow the jerk is everything i hate about the people here hes smug and entitled and three inches taller than me im not short especially for a lawyer but hes a mutant i hate having to look up to him he fired his assistant on the day she announced she was pregnant and he did it during the celebration in the conference room everyone was congratulating her and he pulled her aside and told her hed arranged the celebration so that security would have a chance to clean out her desk and pack her stuff in a box she had a miscarriage later that night he admits no responsibility at least i wait until they come back from maternity leave before i tell them theyre fired the jerk is like a spoiled brat in his customtailored suit meant to hide the fifteen extra pounds hes put on still getting over the disappointment that hell never be a supreme court justice thats what they go to these top law schools hoping for all of them and the jerk went to harvard the worst one of them all very few people go to harvard just to become a lawyer they go to harvard to become chief justice normal kids grow up wanting to be firemen and astronauts and baseball players one kid i interviewed this past fall told me he had a book of supreme court paper dolls when he was a kid and played with them every day that isnt normal this is who these kids are though these minijerks jerksintraining these jerks who populate these hallways id have happily shared the bagel with him id have even given him the bigger half posted by anonymous at 950 am to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date thursday may 11 1110 am im kind of embarrassed to tell you this but i actually started one of those weblogs the other day after i looked at the student ones you told me about its ridiculous and im sure im not going to keep it going but theres no one here i can talk openly to and i thought it might be fun to have a place to write about life i wrote a screenplay when i was in college did i ever tell you that im sure it was terrible i probably wont keep the blog for long but ive had some endless conference calls this week and ive needed something to do i want you to check it out and make sure its working and also make sure no one can trace it back to me no one can trace it if im anonymous right you know this computer stuff better than i do im changing the details and not using anyones name but i just want to make sure it wouldnt be good for everyone in the firm to start reading this and know its me the address is httpanonymouslawyerblogspotcom let me know if it looks okay to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date thursday may 11 1155 am the one who missed her kids funeral i hope youre exaggerating the blogs working fine graphically its pretty basic but im sure you dont want to spend your time playing around with that stuff you probably do need to be careful id imagine there are plenty of law students who would love to know whats going on inside a partners head definitely be careful about specific details i know students at school whove been able to keep their blogs anonymous for a few years but theyre careful not to write anything traceable never any names they switch the genders and the dates and they make sure nothing gives them away its a small world and if there are a couple hundred law firms like yours you start saying too much and by process of elimination someones going to find you but i dont think you have all that much to worry about there are a million blogs out there i sent the link to a couple of friends who are also going to law school in the fall i didnt say you were my uncle i just said i stumbled across the site so its nothing to worry about ill let you know if they say anything to me about it that tax kid sent me an email yesterday he wanted to know if people living in the dorms have to take communal showers i think he may be a strange boy did you watch the dodgers game last night i told you they need a better bullpen its going to be a disaster like last year i should be studying anyway to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date thursday may 11 1255 pm thanks for looking at the blog im making sure to disguise things the jerk didnt take a bagel he took a croissant and the dodgers will be fine its still early give them a chance im leaving the office right after lunch and getting in a round of golf i just saw the tax guy in the bathroom and he told me his son said you wrote back a helpful response i appreciate it hes so impressed youre going to yale he didnt get into yale and hopefully his son wont either youre helping me win these conversations so thanks friday may 12 theres a farewell reception for the old guy this afternoon in conference room 24b hes been chairman of the firm for fifteen years but he just turned seventyfive and the executive committee is forcing him out theyve got some chocolate truffle cake and an open bar or at least thats what my secretary is telling me you can tell how much we think of people by what kind of food we give out in their honor we celebrate birthdays at the firm for associates its usually some yellow sheet cake for partners well add some ice cream maybe some brownies for the support staff well throw a box of oreos on the table and see if anyone bothers to show up inevitably people do partners making a million dollars a year will still leave their desks for a free cookie theres not a partner here who can name one member of the custodial staff yet when they get the email that its karls birthday suddenly hes every partners best friend because theres a package of chunky chips ahoy in the attorney lounge ill eat the cookies like everyone else but at least its not entirely a charade on my part there are a lot of things im terrible at like being a decent human being but one thing im good at is remembering peoples birthdays it fools people into thinking i have a heart ill go up to a secretary and wish her a happy birthday and shes shocked i even remember the month or that she has a birthday or that shes a person who was once born its a party trick birthdays names faces i remember them if i meet someones kids it sticks howre roberto and juanita i might ask if we had any hispanic lawyers at the firm and joaquins eyes would open wide and hed ask me how i could possibly remember the names of his kids when he cant recall ever even talking to me before its just something im good at it fools clients too and it especially fools summer associates the nave law students we bring on as interns each summer wholl come back after graduation and replace all the attorneys whove left when i drop a detail into a conversation something i learned about them when they interviewed back in the fall they think i care i dont howd the year at the law school newspaper finish up you remember of course i remember youre quite an impressive student im so glad to have you aboard this summer thanks i appreciate that now i know that another partners got you working on that fascinating research assignment but i was hoping i could steal you away for half a day to help me track down a piece of paper thats somewhere in a big room full of boxes im asking you in particular because of that newspaper experience i know how good journalists are at uncovering the scoop and im sure youre one of the best so what do you say you put down that other guys files help me out and ill take you for a reimbursable lunch later this week it gets them every time this years batch of summers will be here on monday but today its all about the old guy truffle cake and vodka shots it beats the box of triscuits we had when the director of client services retired yeah we didnt even spring for cookies that time the old guy has put in some good years of service he led our global expansion to europe and asia he streamlined the core practice groups to increase profits per partner and move us ten spots higher in the american lawyer rankings he left his wife for an associate a few years ago a terrible associate shoddy work lack of commitment to the firm she knew she wasnt going to make partner on her own merits so she figured shed find another route shes hidden away in trusts and estates now where lawyers go to die the old guys forced retirement is moving everyone up one spot in the hierarchy the line of succession has been pretty clear for a while the new chairman currently head of the corporate department has been with the firm for thirtythree years waiting his turn hes from another generation he remembers when the life of a lawyer wasnt quite so lucrative he prefers a greasy cheeseburger to a hundreddollar omakase sushi dinner hes only got two houses he flies coach but hes sharp he knew how to play the politics of this place and get himself into the chairmans office and ive got to do the same if i want to be next the new chairman will last no more than fifteen seventeen years tops and then its going to be me or the jerk the problem is that theyve been grooming both of us and we cant both get that office it seems like theres all the time in the world to prepare but thats exactly what the jerk wants me to think while he tries to elbow his way ahead of me i need to be vigilant with the old guy it was easy i learned to play racquetball just to get that face time with him and it got me to where i am today the new chairman doesnt play racquetball hes built for brunch more than racquetball i had my secretary send him a gift basket from lobels of new york finest steak money can buy hopefully hell think of me while he eats it the jerk sent him flowers i win time for truffle cake posted by anonymous at 354 pm to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date friday may 12 417 pm you ever have truffle cake its good next summer it can be yours to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date friday may 12 433 pm it sounds better than dininghall food to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date friday may 12 448 pm go out tonight my treat just send me the receipt its the least i can do youve given me someone to brag about you can celebrate that im finally one step closer to becoming chairman of the firm to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date friday may 12 455 pm you sure thanks thats so generous of you to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date friday may 12 504 pm you deserve it ive got the worlds smartest niece stanford is one thing but yale law school is quite another especially looking at where you came from i love your mom but she was never the scholar growing up i admit it im jealous just a bit of all the opportunities youre going to have i did fine going to michigan for college and law school but youre doing it the way it ought to be done stanford yale and the most prestigious firm we can get you working for ill take advantage of every connection ive got i promise youll go right to the top to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date friday may 12 525 pm i appreciate this so much but like i told you im not sure a big law firm is really where i want to end up i want to help people to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date friday may 12 535 pm dont worry give me a little time and ill squeeze that helping people crap right out of you saturday may 13 the summer program starts on monday and im hosting a party this afternoon to thank everyone in advance for making this the best summer yet im up early waiting for the guys with the tent to arrive i undersold the party as a barbecue but its actually a surfandturf buffet after a cocktail hour and some music from a threepiece string ensemble i dropped a few grand on i made the maid stay late last night to ensure everything would be perfect i realized this morning that the fringes on the rugs werent lined up so i got down on my knees and fixed them myself it would have cost a client 275 if i was able to bill the time the partners will get a tour of the inside of the house the associates will be limited to the backyard area my secretary helped me with the planning and im sure she expected an invitation to come but there wasnt a chance of that i dont need to have this party on the surface its to thank everyone in advance for treating the summer associates well this year and not letting them get too much of a glimpse of what working here is really like but what its really about is a chance to impress the new chairman to show off my house and finally get to exhibit the patio furniture that i had upholstered in the firms color when im chairman ill probably change our color this cornflower blue isnt my favorite its not masculine enough id like a forest green maybe a hunter mixed with just a little note of midnight blue ive thought about this a lot we need to make a bolder statement in the marketplace to stand out against our competition cornflower isnt bold enough its on my list of things to address when i finally become chairman others 1 buy a new couch for my office 2 no more free food for overweight associates 3 paralegals dont get health benefits 4 fix the wobbly conference table in 23d 5 switch to threeply toilet paper thats just the first five ive got hundreds ive rented the deluxe tent with the wind panels and the carpet floor it cost a bunch of money but its worth it anonymous wife is still in bed of course even though she knows how important this is shes useless anyway i had to hide her car in the garage because its an old honda with two dents in it and i dont want the other partners to see it i moved my lexus out front its a better image id get anonymous wife a nicer car but she destroys them she does her makeup while shes driving or talks on the phone paying no attention to anything one day shes going to kill herself or the kids or even worse me i dont drive with her anymore the only thing i let her do is take the service providers home the maid and the babysitter if they get into an accident its a loss but im willing to take the risk she doesnt understand the point of this party she doesnt like the idea of a bunch of old men wandering through the living room but what can i expect i read us news and she reads us weekly if you can even call it reading shes still pretty enough sure thats never been the problem but she sits in the house watching reruns of press your luck on the game show network and goes out with her friends for twohundreddollar lunches and to stroll through department stores buying dozens of things we dont need the crap just ends up in the garage never touched an antique cuckoo clock a towel warmer a dog bed a 24karat gold chess set as if shes ever played chess even just once in her life a cake decorating kit and the latest addition to the pile of junk a fourfootlong rainstick we dont need a rainstick it just gives anonymous son something else to break any day now little grains of barley or whatevers inside a rainstick are going to be rolling all over the floor and someones going to break his neck i wont even call the ambulance if its my wife maybe itll teach her a lesson but i need her for todays party without her people start to get suspicious you cant be creepy like the real estate guy who goes home to his mother every night or fat those people dont have a future they cant hope for the top you need the image of a perfect family or youre not executive committee material you dont get the best clients or the office with the ocean view you need to blend in at the firm picnic and be part of the club or youre simply not an integral part of the future of the firm the people with the tent are finally knocking at the door 739 almost ten minutes late thatll be twenty bucks off the tip at least posted by anonymous at 740 am saturday may 13 what a waste my chance to impress the new chairman and he was here for all of fifteen minutes the fancy tent the string ensemble the hundreddollar surf and turf all for him and he didnt even have the decency to stay past the cocktail hour he and the jerk snuck away somewhere too quick for me to intercept and make sure the new chairman got the tour instead i was left with the bteam eating my food and traipsing around my backyard killing the grass if hed left with anyone besides the jerk i wouldnt be so concerned but every second of face time counts ive synchronized my bathroom habits just to make sure i get in there right when the new chairman does it wreaks havoc on my system but its worth it besides the new chairmans quick exit the party went off without a hitch except for an early mishap with an associate during the cocktail hour the frumpy litigator is allergic to shellfish but one of the partners didnt know and offered her a bite of his lobster cake like any good associate she knows the rules when a partner tells you to do something you do it no matter what anaphylactic shock be damned she politely took a bite and as soon as she had the chance turned and spit it into her napkin but by then it was too late she pulled me aside and said she thought she might need to go to the hospital of course i let her leave despite the importance of the party she handled the whole situation very discreetly ill be sure to send her an ecard on monday wishing her a speedy recovery anonymous wife who thankfully took her wellbutrin today i crushed it up and put it in her oatmeal led the partners on a splendid tour through the house pointing out everything wed rehearsed like the shelf of awards ive received from clients over the years including the lucite pin from the bowling alley conglomerate the etched crystal corncob from the fertilizer company i helped out of bankruptcy and the silver thumbtack from the office superstore the awards spend three years on my bookshelf in the office before retiring to the house displacing another one of anonymous daughters ceramic monstrosities from art class or one of anonymous sons karate trophies my kids behaved themselves which is more than i can say for the help on his way out the guy with the overbite a sixthyear associate on the partner track accidentally kicked over a wine glass like anyone would he stood there crossed his arms and waited for one of the waiters to come clean it up it took a waiter almost a full fortyfive seconds to notice even as the guy with the overbite was pointing and gesturing and getting pretty upset it was embarrassing and i shaved another twenty dollars off the tip anonymous son was about to go over and help but of course i told him that wasnt his job maybe in twenty years if he follows in his mothers footsteps but he shouldnt be cleaning up glass when hes eight posted by anonymous at 1112 pm to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date sunday may 14 905 am two posts in one day youre like a thirteenyearold girl to anonymous niece from anonymous lawyer date sunday may 14 911 am it was a big day i know im getting addicted to this its probably not healthy but ive had no one to talk to about work for the past eighteen years so its kind of pouring out im sure itll get old and im sure no ones reading it anyway youre having an exciting weekend i hope to anonymous lawyer from anonymous niece date sunday may 14 918 am an exciting weekend studying sure dinner on friday was great thanks a couple of friends and i got some thai food it was like fifteen bucks each its okay if you werent serious about paying for it i can afford a 15 dinner the friends i told about the blog said theyve been reading and they love it i think they passed the link along to some other people too so thats cool youve got some students reading and i dont think theres any way they can link it back to youno one even knows youre my uncle thank goodness if it gets around at law school that my uncle is a hiring partner ill probably get more rsums than the people in career services sunday may 14 twentyeight messages on my blackberry this morning the blackberry has absolutely revolutionized the way the firm works it used to be that in times of crisis associates were tethered to their desks unable to leave for lunch for dinner for the bathroom or for an emergency appendectomy for fear that we wouldnt be able to get in touch with them but now that they can receive email wherever they are twentyfour hours a day their freedom has increased dramatically now its okay for them to go to the hospital after their sons in an accident or to take an hour to drive their fourteenyearold daughter to the abortion clinic or to go brush their teeth after theyve been in the office all night its a great feeling to know that if i have a research question at three in the morning i can email an associate and expect an answer within minutes but to wake up to twentyeight messages on a sunday is unusual all these messages are part of our longrunning debate about the dress code for the summer program youd be surprised what some of the summer associates think they can get away with jeans tshirts bold colors like green and brown ties with unapproved patterns and even opentoed shoes last night one of the senior partners emailed to the entire hiring committee that he felt we should make a lastminute change to the memo well be distributing tomorrow and completely ban facial hair this would be a change from the current policy under which with special permission neatly trimmed beards and mustaches are acceptable apparently this senior partner spent the day with his grandchildren was alarmed by their sideburns and wants to revisit the issue my take on it is that we want to be seen as a firm thats friendly to students whove made alternative lifestyle choices including those involving facial hair besides thered be enforcement problems if any summer associates have to work through the night and wont have access to a razor luckily cooler heads have prevailed and we wont have to reprint the memo before the summer associates arrive theres enough to do tomorrow anyway ive got to lock the crazy partners in their offices and make sure they dont get out there are certain attorneys that the summers are never allowed to see the ones who hit the ones who smell and the ones who are just so high on the aspergers scale that we cant risk letting them interact with law students were hoping will accept our offers at the end of the summer and come back after graduation everyone here has aspergers syndrome to some extent its one of the markings of a corporate lawyer but the summers have it too so it all works out okay its the ones at the tail end of the bell curve like the tax guy that we have to control hell start talking to summers about the consistency of his bowel movements posted by anonymous at 946 am
